00:00 they would be to just show a few view
00:02 graphs to introduce the topic and my
00:08 name is how put off I'm director of the
00:11 Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin
00:14 Austin Texas
00:15 and since 1985 we've had a very
00:19 intensive program both theoretically and
00:22 experimentally on new energy concepts
00:26 and so we have an ongoing budget the
00:29 engineers working in the laboratory
00:31 everyday many patents for various
00:35 devices and so we feel like we're making
00:38 reasonable progress and one of the
00:44 requirements we have is that the work be
00:46 of high enough quality that it can get
00:50 published in mainstream literature so
00:53 we've published many papers in Physical
00:57 Review in the United States which is the
01:00 toughest of the journals to publish in
01:05 so it is possible to present these ideas
01:09 in the mainstream even one of the papers
01:13 that we published last year had the in
01:16 Physical Review had the title extracting
01:19 energy and heat from the vacuum and so
01:23 that that was accepted I and a colleague
01:26 from IBM worked on the energetics and
01:29 the thermodynamics to show that there
01:32 was no violation of either to pursue
01:35 this concept
01:37 [Music]
01:43 as we all know there are problems with
01:46 fossil fuel sources which we presently
01:49 use pollution byproducts there's
01:56 certainly problems with the nuclear
01:58 power plants especially in the United
02:01 States there's a very distant now
02:04 essentially impossible to build a new
02:06 nuclear power plant so people in the end
02:09 it's energy industry are out searching
02:12 for alternatives and of course some of
02:15 these are familiar solar energy
02:18 thermonuclear fusion in the beginning
02:22 thermonuclear fusion looked like it
02:24 would be a great boon but you're
02:29 probably familiar with the joke it goes
02:32 around thermonuclear fusion looks great
02:34 about 15 years in the future
02:36 but then it's always looked great about
02:37 15 years ago capillary fusion is a
02:45 different form of fusion that may work
02:48 there's a lot of controversy about so
02:51 called cold fusion fusion under non
02:55 thermonuclear conditions but the one I'm
02:58 going to talk about which I think has
03:02 great promise is so-called zero-point
03:05 energy extraction I'll explain what I
03:10 mean by zero-point energy it really is
03:17 the energy of so-called empty space the
03:22 concept of empty space has gone through
03:26 several shifts over the past couple
03:30 thousand years
03:31 for example Democritus that empty space
03:34 was a void otherwise how could there be
03:38 room for the atoms to move around in but
03:42 then Aristotle came along and said no
03:43 empty space must not really be empty
03:46 because we have heat and light and it
03:50 must propagate through something finding
03:54 this was codified last century by
03:56 Maxwell
03:57 and electromagnetic theory saying well
04:00 if electromagnetic waves are waves in
04:03 like water waves they must have
04:04 something to propagate in so there must
04:07 be an ether but then in special
04:10 relativity when attempts were made to
04:13 try to measure velocity through this
04:16 either it couldn't be done
04:19 and so with special relativity and the
04:23 michelson-morley experiment people said
04:25 okay there is no ether empty space is
04:28 really empty but there was only ten
04:32 years later my Stein himself in
04:34 developing general relativity ended up
04:36 having space time that could be
04:40 distorted and warped and by the time he
04:44 got finished describing what general
04:46 relativity had to say about space with
04:48 all these properties of being warped and
04:50 distorted Einstein himself said well in
04:55 space isn't empty introduced the term
04:59 metric but basically that sort of
05:02 brought the idea of a full space back so
05:05 Einstein didn't really get rid of it
05:06 except for a few years and finally with
05:09 quantum theory that's when it became
05:11 absolutely clear that empty space was
05:14 not empty there are vacuum fluctuations
05:18 particles come out of the vacuum and
05:22 then annihilate and go back into the
05:24 vacuum so it's now recognized by quantum
05:27 theorists that empty space is very full
05:29 very active what do I mean by that let's
05:38 say we have a case of say a mass and a
05:42 spring you pull down and and you let it
05:44 go like that or say have a kid on a
05:48 swing and you give them a push and let
05:51 go
05:53 classically we say that the thing will
05:57 eventually come to rest the oscillator
05:59 will come to rest it comes to rest
06:03 because there are losses in the system
06:05 energy leaves the system and eventually
06:08 would come to rest but quantum
06:10 mechanically we say that's not the case
06:12 if you excite an oscillator you push a
06:16 swing or a pendulum you do anything like
06:19 that and let it go losses will reduce
06:22 its energy if it only comes down to a
06:25 certain minimal amount of energy and
06:27 that energy remains and so everything at
06:30 the microscopic scale is always
06:32 fluctuating in fact it turns out that
06:36 team and it's been calculated in this
06:40 room there's enough energy in that
06:44 volume to evaporate all the world's
06:46 oceans and that's not a controversial
06:49 idea or fringe idea and standard quantum
06:55 mechanics it's recognized that the
06:57 energy in even a coffee cup there's
07:01 enough to evaporate all the world's
07:02 oceans john wheelers calculated richard
07:05 climene's calculated it the question is
07:08 can we get at that energy and for a long
07:12 time it's been thought probably not but
07:15 as I'll go through in my presentation
07:17 tomorrow there's been a history of
07:19 development where we see that you can
07:20 get at that energy they might ask
07:24 there's all that energy right there
07:26 where does it come from and we know
07:30 where it comes from
07:30 [Music]
07:41 every piece of matter in the universe is
07:44 fluctuating around doing its quantum
07:47 dance and so doing it radiates energy
07:50 out and then every other atom is sitting
07:54 in that radiation field and absorbing it
07:57 and that causes it to jump around and
08:01 therefore radiate so it's basically the
08:04 electromagnetic equivalent of putting a
08:06 microphone by a speaker and getting
08:08 squeal the particle fluctuations
08:12 generate the fields the fields cause the
08:14 particles to fluctuate and you can do
08:18 the calculation and show that that
08:19 accounts for where the vacuum
08:21 fluctuations come from it's a giant
08:23 cosmological feedback system and we've
08:27 published that in Physical Review the
08:29 details on it
08:31 they might say if there's all that
08:33 energy even right here in the room
08:35 why don't we notice it well in fact we
08:39 do experiment any of you can do to prove
08:48 that that energy is really there suppose
08:54 you're on a bus or a train it takes off
08:57 with a jerk and you fall back on the
09:00 floor what is the force that knocked you
09:03 down
09:05 I mean it's a big force to knock you
09:08 down well it's that has the train or the
09:13 bus tried to accelerate you you ran in
09:17 to the wall of vacuum fluctuations and
09:20 there was a resisting wind from the
09:24 vacuum that held you back and knocked
09:26 you down it turns out that that
09:32 resistance to accelerating through the
09:35 vacuum energy is proportional to
09:37 acceleration so unlike ordinary wind if
09:42 you're just moving in a constant
09:44 velocity you don't feel it but if
09:47 something tries to accelerate you you do
09:49 feel it and hold you back
09:52 and so the reason Newton's law says
09:54 force equals mass times acceleration the
09:58 reason that when you apply a force you
09:59 get an acceleration is that you have to
10:02 apply a force proportional to
10:04 acceleration and overt in order to
10:07 overcome the vacuum energy holding you
10:10 back which is also proportional to
10:12 acceleration so actually there's no more
10:16 ubiquitous constant phenomena every time
10:20 you move your hand you feel the vacuum
10:24 so the energy is very palpable we just
10:29 published this in Physical Review in
10:31 February of this year and so it was very
10:36 well received there was a two-page
10:39 write-up in science magazine and also in
10:42 Scientific American and those are very
10:45 conservative publications in the United
10:47 States and yet still they were
10:50 interested in published about it does
10:53 this close the loop of the terms of the
10:56 universal theory well from our
10:59 standpoint the vacuum fluctuations do
11:04 provide a unifying field field theory
11:10 I've already shown in earlier work that
11:12 gravitation can be accounted for and
11:15 gravitational mass can be accounted for
11:17 on the basis of interaction of particles
11:21 with the vacuum fluctuations and then in
11:24 this paper we found that the inertial
11:26 mass came out to be the same as the
11:28 gravitational mass and that's known
11:31 empirically but from a philosophical
11:34 standpoint it's never known why the
11:36 inertial mass and gravitational mass can
11:38 be the same and the answer is they both
11:42 arise from interacting with the vacuum
11:43 fluctuations and it fixes them to be the
11:47 same no that's an addition who asked the
12:00 question right right that's an addition
12:03 when you when you write down what is the
12:05 background in the universe you get two
12:09 terms the one term is a zero-point
12:13 energy the other term is a thermal
12:16 background distribution the reason the
12:19 zero-point energy is called zero point
12:21 is because if you let temperature go all
12:24 the way to zero the thermal term will
12:27 disappear or after zero point this first
12:31 term which we now call zero-point energy
12:35 remains it doesn't depend on the
12:37 temperature so the term zero point and
12:39 zero point energy means zero temperature
12:44 point so you would have zero point
12:46 energy at Absolute Zero at Absolute Zero
12:50 and in the absence of anything else
12:53 that's right so if you go on the
12:55 furthest vacuum of outer space and
12:57 you're hoping to power your spaceship on
13:00 zero point energy you would not have a
13:02 problem don't know if you leave no for -
13:05 and I don't ecology orientation
13:08 thanks elevation you say you doubted the
13:12 doctors installations observations can
13:17 you because the density dizzy or this
13:20 custody of the ease of changes as a
13:22 result causal TV change okay when our
13:27 modeling I would agree with the first
13:30 part and that is if the density of the
13:32 vacuum fluctuations changes these will
13:34 change but our model they changed
13:36 together but I had fun luck with all
13:38 these what yet thirty-six percent for
13:44 the Jovian woods that close already
13:47 nicely now we're interested here is
13:59 extracting this energy for use now it's
14:03 a well-known false idea in physics that
14:07 well we have all this heat energy around
14:10 us
14:10 why don't we somehow extract that energy
14:12 for use but you can prove that just
14:16 doesn't work it would take more energy
14:18 to get the energy out of the surrounding
14:20 heat than you again and someone's
14:24 recognized a zero point energy was there
14:26 it was thought that similarly it
14:29 couldn't be extracted but a researcher
14:34 huge laboratory pointed out that there
14:36 was already in effect in the laboratory
14:38 which demonstrated that the zero-point
14:41 energy could be extracted it's a
14:44 so-called Casimir effect Casimir effect
14:48 is named after Heinrich Kazmir who was
14:51 research director for many years at
14:54 Philips Laboratory in the Netherlands
14:57 and this is what he noticed as you know
15:02 if you have a say a radio transistor
15:05 radio and you take it in your car or go
15:10 inside of a metal building or inside of
15:13 a shielded cage you can't hear the radio
15:15 stations the metal shields out the
15:20 electromagnetic signals
15:23 well this vacuum fluctuations are
15:26 electromagnetic signals and so Kazmir
15:31 realized that if you had a metal
15:35 enclosure or say even just a couple of
15:38 metal plates together close to each
15:41 other that the region in between would
15:44 be somewhat shielded from the vacuum
15:48 energy coming from all different
15:49 directions it would be somewhat shielded
15:52 well this energy has radiation pressure
15:57 momentum energy just like any
16:00 electromagnetic wave so between the
16:03 plates where some of that energy is
16:06 shielded out the energy traveling back
16:09 and forth puts only a certain amount of
16:12 radiation pressure outward but outside
16:15 where there is no shielding you have all
16:17 the energy pushing in by radiation
16:20 pressure and so what happens is that the
16:24 plates are pushed together and this is a
16:27 large force and it's been measured in
16:29 the laboratory the force goes up to a
16:32 million Newton's per square meter at
16:34 close distances well a Newton is the
16:36 weight of a book the square meter is
16:39 about a square yard so it's a big big
16:42 effect certain cases when you bring
16:45 metal tips down closest close to pieces
16:49 of metal for example an electron beam
16:52 machining this force is strong enough to
16:54 pull the metal tip into the material and
16:57 in industrial processes you have to use
17:00 strong servo mechanisms to keep it away
17:03 so this is a big effect well what a
17:06 researcher at Hughes realized was okay
17:10 if I put up two metal plates in outer
17:13 space and I walk away those plates will
17:17 get pushed together faster and faster
17:20 and faster and faster until they finally
17:22 hit and when they do that generates heat
17:25 so you've actually converted some vacuum
17:28 energy into heat
17:30 and you can trace that it doesn't
17:33 violate conservation of energy you can
17:35 trace bit by bit where the energy comes
17:38 from the energy comes out of the vacuum
17:41 starts to push the place together as
17:43 they get closer and closer more and more
17:46 modes are shielded the energy vacuum
17:49 energy that was in those modes has now
17:51 gone into the kinetic energy the plates
17:53 moving together closer and closer more
17:57 modes excluded more kinetic energy and
18:01 then they hit the kinetic energy is
18:02 turned into heat so there was a proof of
18:04 principle absolutely acceptable in
18:07 mainstream physics that the vacuum
18:09 energy could be tapped now the question
18:12 is is there some way to tap it
18:16 efficiently yes right like that's part
18:31 that's right it's part of it that's part
18:33 of it the other is there are some
18:35 charged effects on the surfaces too of
18:38 service that's when they go together you
18:40 can't pull them apart yourself do that
18:42 you have to do it this way right and our
18:45 since lasers have been invented people
18:47 always have these very polished optical
18:50 flats and lasers and again when you put
18:52 them together you can't pull on the part
18:54 you've got it tearing apart that's
18:56 partly this effect so the question is is
19:00 there a way of getting it out
19:02 efficiently so far there are three ways
19:06 that are known to extract the energy in
19:08 an engineering sense
19:11 the first is electromechanical and this
19:14 was published by this researcher at
19:17 Hughes and even applied for a patent
19:21 called a vacuum fluctuation battery I
19:24 don't know if he got the patent but he
19:26 applied for it his idea was well instead
19:29 of letting the plates come together and
19:30 make heat I will charge the plates
19:33 electrically and then as they come
19:36 together they will build up strong
19:38 electric field and then you can use that
19:41 field to drive currents through a
19:42 battery but it's not practical because
19:47 the amount of energy you get and the
19:50 difficulty in dealing with them so close
19:53 it's just not practical but in our
19:57 laboratory we're working on two
19:58 additional methods instead of having
20:04 plates come together you can also have a
20:10 cylinder which is squeezed or you can
20:13 have wedges which are pushed together in
20:16 other words anytime you have surfaces
20:18 near each other that can control the
20:20 vacuum modes you will get this kind of
20:22 pressure force and so in addition to
20:25 like squeezing a metal boundary it's
20:28 also possible to make a plasma a little
20:31 lightning discharge in the laboratory
20:34 just a high-tech version of scraping
20:36 your foot on the rug and touching the
20:38 doorknob and getting a little spark and
20:41 it turns out that if you meet certain
20:46 conditions on the density and the
20:49 voltage and so on then you can get this
20:52 effect to squeeze a plasma as well as
20:55 pull metal together and so that's one of
21:00 the approaches that we're looking at
21:02 generating little lightning bolts in the
21:05 laboratory they condense the charge by
21:09 the way it leads to a whole new
21:10 technology condensed charge technology
21:12 which we have 18 different devices
21:15 patented medical x-rays fast computer
21:21 chips flat panel displays
21:24 microwave generators the whole series of
21:27 things that come out of just having this
21:29 condensed charged but the energy thing
21:31 is the one that we're pursuing most
21:32 dramatically in the laboratory there's
21:35 also another one another phenomenon
21:37 called sonoluminescence and for those of
21:39 you have been interested in research
21:41 with water this is pretty interesting if
21:46 you have a turbulent fluid that bubbles
21:51 in the fluid this vacuum pressure force
21:55 will collapse the bubbles and it's now
21:58 been studied in the laboratory that when
22:01 those bubbles collapse they put out
22:03 intense bursts of light in 50 22:06 picoseconds you can get a hundred
22:08 thousand photons out of one little
22:10 bubble and julian schwinger who's Nobel
22:15 Prize winner in physics has shown that
22:19 this energy comes from the Casimir
22:21 effect in other words this is a
22:23 conversion of vacuum energy into another
22:25 form in this case light heat radio waves
22:31 so we know of a laboratory that has some
22:36 experiments going in which they were
22:38 creating turbulent bubbles and fluids
22:40 and then measuring the energy in the
22:43 water by the heat and they were getting
22:47 over unity efficiency and so we are have
22:51 now arranged to have those devices
22:54 shipped to our laboratory and we're
22:55 going to do a very detailed study but in
22:59 this case we're talking about kilowatts
23:01 of excess energy what right kilowatt now
23:08 people often think that well if you come
23:10 up with a new energy idea the oil
23:14 companies will squash you like a bug
23:19 it's not true that myth I don't believe
23:23 it's true once we had our laboratory
23:26 results we applied for our patents one
23:28 of the first things I did I went to
23:31 Pennzoil and I briefed the president
23:33 Scottie Holland pres
23:35 pennzoil I went to Texaco and briefed
23:38 the research director I went to these
23:40 oil companies and told them about the
23:43 potential of this new energy source what
23:48 would be the response of their
23:49 corporation I didn't tell them we had it
23:53 just in case then they'd get a picture
23:55 right but I said it's possible in
24:00 principle what would be your response
24:01 their response was we would absolutely
24:04 welcome it because their resource is
24:08 running out when they draw small amounts
24:12 of it out of the ground and make drugs
24:14 and plastics and nylon pharmaceuticals
24:18 they don't use that much of the resource
24:21 and they have a large profit margin but
24:24 when they draw it out of the ground and
24:26 dump it in automobiles and dump it into
24:29 heating your house it uses up an
24:33 enormous amount of resource and they
24:34 have very little profit so they said
24:37 they would be glad to have some other
24:39 energy source come along and take this
24:41 burden from them they said the way they
24:44 see it it's as if you were heating your
24:47 house by burning van Gogh's and
24:49 Picasso's really ridiculous no they also
24:54 said that if these new energy sources
24:56 come along they would be the first to
24:59 invest in them to make the refineries
25:01 more efficient so I think the myth that
25:07 they'll stop you just simply isn't true
25:12 we've worked out our own development
25:15 strategy to avoid difficulties with
25:19 competing with other industries
25:25 for example we might think that the
25:27 Mideast would not like this development
25:29 even if it's okay with the refineries
25:32 but the way to overcome that is to go to
25:38 the Mideast people and ask them to
25:41 underwrite the new development so that
25:44 that can pull the plug on their
25:47 potential competition the nuclear
25:51 industry also does not have to be
25:53 threatened by the development of these
25:55 sources because you can go to the
25:57 nuclear industry and say you've got your
25:59 magnificent billion dollar plant here
26:01 we're not going to bother that what we
26:04 want you to do is pull out those nasty
26:07 radioactive rods and throw them away and
26:10 drop in our new devices and then you can
26:12 go to the public and say we have gotten
26:15 rid of radioactive pollution and we're
26:17 reducing the price to the consumer so it
26:20 could be a big win for the nuclear
26:22 industry and they can continue to use
26:24 their power plants I'm going to talk
26:41 about that in a minute
26:43 right here skip the generator in the
26:45 garage stage we think although you could
26:49 we think it would be better not to do
26:51 that and I'll try to explain why with
26:56 the electric power utilities the way you
26:59 keep from threatening them is that you
27:02 don't want to have everyone have one in
27:04 the garage and unplug immediately
27:06 because the economic chaos would be too
27:08 big but the electric power utilities are
27:11 having it meet increased capacity
27:13 requirements all the time and in the
27:16 United States and must satisfy a Clean
27:18 Air Act which is very difficult and so
27:22 you go to the electric power industries
27:23 and say ok as you add new units to meet
27:30 increasing demand
27:32 and need to meet clean air requirements
27:35 don't build more of the old kind just
27:38 add our form because let's face it even
27:42 if we had generators up and running it
27:44 would still be a couple of decades
27:45 before you could get them all
27:47 distributed around anyway so we think
27:50 you'd skip the generator in the garage
27:51 stage instead you go to a TV
27:55 manufacturer you would go to a washing
27:58 machine manufacturer a dishwasher
28:01 manufacturer and say ok on your next new
28:04 model instead of having a plug that
28:07 plugs in the wall have these
28:10 never-say-die batteries in the back and
28:14 so that way as units become obsolete new
28:19 units get introduced without plugs and
28:21 so you slowly unplug from utility
28:27 companies instead of doing it all at
28:29 once there's economic didn't most people
28:34 are not going to go out and buy all-new
28:36 equipment that's right that's right so I
28:41 think that's that's the way to avert it
28:43 and of course there are always these
28:45 special-purpose things which special
28:49 units can be built for and those will
28:52 just develop as they develop
28:55 [Music]
28:58 of course at the conference I will give
29:01 you know some more of the technical
29:03 detail without making it too technical
29:06 but so what's the present status
29:09 realistically from our standpoint first
29:12 of all it's scientifically sound this is
29:15 not pseudoscience the Casimir effect is
29:18 a real effect it's known to extract
29:20 energy from the vacuum absolutely
29:23 accepted by physicists it's certainly
29:28 embryonic in development because I'm
29:31 sure none of us arrived here today in an
29:34 automobile powered by zero-point energy
29:36 so it is definitely early stages of R&D
29:40 when investors come to us and we do have
29:44 investors in our laboratory we tell them
29:46 it's high-risk infinite payoff so but it
29:51 is high risk so if you want to invest
29:55 money in something that you know will
29:56 make money in the next five years maybe
29:59 you wouldn't invest in this but if you
30:01 want to live your old age out as a
30:04 trillionaire or maybe imagine you would
30:07 so for workers in the field our feeling
30:10 is that just the 20th century may go
30:12 down in energy terms is the nuclear age
30:15 we think the 21st century will be the
30:18 zero-point energy age that's art there
30:26 I'll be glad to answer any questions and
30:29 we just open up for discussion because
30:30 there are other people here who know
30:32 considerable amount

00:41 oh
00:45 [Music]
00:47 remote viewing
00:48 the modern mental martial art
00:51 a yoga for the mind
00:54 you are about to learn from the masters
00:57 of the craft
00:58 the history the art the science and the
01:02 secrets
01:03 of remote viewing through time and space
01:11 there has been an enormous amount
01:12 written in various books
01:15 about what the cia did or did not do
01:19 about remote viewing
01:23 some of the stuff is fairly amazing
01:28 if not credible
01:31 our first speaker
01:33 whom i have known for about 35 years
01:38 looks like a man who knows where the
01:40 secrets are
01:44 and in fact does
01:47 and tonight he's going to share some of
01:49 them with us
01:52 i met hal put off back in the early 70s
01:57 he had a national reputation as a
01:59 physicist working in laser and laser
02:01 optics
02:04 who got interested in remote viewing
02:07 and who along with russell targ
02:10 were the founding scientists of that
02:13 laboratory
02:15 it is a real pleasure to get hal to come
02:18 out and talk about this
02:20 you're going to hear stuff you haven't
02:22 heard anywhere else
02:23 and you're going to hear it from the
02:25 person who really does know
02:27 where the truth lies
02:30 it's my pleasure to give you
02:32 hal put off
02:38 [Applause]
02:40 this program began in 1972 02:44 and i'm going to begin with a history of
02:46 the program
02:48 just to give you some perspective on
02:50 exactly what the conditions are in which
02:53 it started
02:54 historically it was a top secret
02:57 what's called special access program and
03:00 an sap
03:02 special access program means that even
03:04 if someone has a top secret clearance
03:07 they may not necessarily have access to
03:09 the program
03:11 it's covered by
03:12 various code words grill flame sun
03:15 streak star gate these are some of the
03:18 names so unless you were on a list
03:21 to have access to these codeword
03:24 materials you did not get access just
03:27 because you had a top secret clearance
03:30 the present time a third of the program
03:32 is still classified
03:34 but a declassification program started
03:36 in july of 1995.
03:39 at that point the cia part of the
03:42 program which is where it started
03:44 declassified the three years that they
03:46 were the prime client
03:49 giving both the history and the actual
03:52 material
03:53 that's available to you through foia
03:56 in september of 1995 03:59 there was an unclassified history of the
04:01 program that covered from 72 to 95 that
04:04 was published as part of a c i a funded
04:06 american institute for research study
04:09 now that part of the program
04:12 did not declassify the actual contents
04:15 of much of the program but just the
04:17 history of the program to date
04:21 73 04:22 500 pages of formerly classified
04:25 material have been
04:26 released another seventeen thousand
04:29 pages are still denied
04:32 and twenty thousand eight hundred pages
04:34 are in review
04:36 you can actually go to the national
04:38 archives in washington dc which i've
04:40 done and you can ask them for a cd
04:44 they won't give it to you
04:46 but they will put it into a computer
04:49 and you can scan the files and if you
04:51 see something you want to learn about
04:53 you can actually print it out
04:55 and then leave with it
04:57 those of us that have been
04:59 deeply involved in the program are doing
05:01 what we can to see if we can't get the
05:03 cds actually released so that people can
05:06 use them at home or wherever perhaps one
05:09 of the most paranormal aspects of the
05:10 program is it ever got started at a
05:13 place like sri
05:15 this entire complex you see here
05:19 is sri at the time
05:21 1972 they were doing about 350 million
05:24 dollars worth of business
05:26 much of it for the government
05:28 originally it was part of stanford
05:30 university
05:31 but with the student riots
05:33 uh and
05:35 recognizing there was classified
05:36 material being handled at sri which the
05:39 students didn't like when it was part of
05:41 stanford university
05:43 they got a divorce
05:45 and
05:46 sri paid stamford university alimony
05:50 and agreed to drop
05:53 stanford in its title so stanford
05:55 research institute is now just called
05:58 sri international
06:01 now the way the program got started i
06:03 had been at stanford and working on
06:05 lasers quantum electronics
06:07 i just completed a textbook with a
06:10 co-author there
06:12 and on lasers and quantum electronics
06:14 and this is always the case there's
06:16 nothing like writing a book to realize
06:17 there's a lot of stuff you don't know
06:20 and one of the things i realized i
06:22 didn't know
06:23 was whether quantum physics could ever
06:26 apply
06:27 to
06:28 human consciousness for example
06:32 and so i proposed a very modest program
06:34 and circulated around a proposal to
06:36 begin to explore
06:39 quantum
06:40 aspects of
06:42 human uh processing
06:45 and a copy of that proposal ended up on
06:48 a desk in new york somebody looked at it
06:51 and it turned out that ingo swann who
06:53 you'll hear more about in this
06:55 conference and who will be presenting in
06:56 this conference happened to see a copy
06:58 of my proposal
07:00 and so he wrote me a letter and he said
07:02 look if you're interested in quantum
07:04 physics and consciousness
07:06 you shouldn't be working with algae
07:07 which is what my proposal had to do with
07:10 because they can't tell you anything
07:13 you should be working with someone like
07:14 me
07:16 you should be working with psychics well
07:18 actually i'd never thought of that
07:20 at that point i'd never even bought a
07:22 copy of fate magazine
07:26 but along with his letter
07:28 he provided some material that indicated
07:30 that he had successfully done some
07:32 psychokinesis work at city college in
07:34 new york and as a physicist that
07:36 interested me
07:37 so i invited him to come out to sri
07:40 and see what he could do
07:42 this is one of his paintings
07:44 uh he's really quite a well-known artist
07:46 and his paintings often appear on covers
07:48 of magazines or have and on the covers
07:51 of books
07:53 this is called appship's view of
07:54 sagittarius and right now it's at the
07:58 national air and space museum the
07:59 smithsonian
08:01 that's ingo on the right as we looked in
08:03 1972.
08:08 so he
08:09 agreed to come out i agreed to have him
08:11 come out
08:13 and i started talking to my physics
08:14 friends about well what kind of
08:16 experiment should we do and of course
08:18 all my cynical physicist friends said
08:20 well
08:21 you know these guys are all frauds and
08:23 charlatans
08:24 you better really have something good or
08:26 you're going to get snickered
08:29 so i looked around to try to find
08:30 something that would be good and what i
08:32 finally came up with was
08:34 a shielded magnetometer it's basically a
08:37 very high-tech compass needle
08:39 but his claim to fame was that it was
08:41 buried
08:42 in the floor of a building
08:44 surrounded by
08:46 electrostatic copper shielding
08:48 surrounded by new metal magnetic
08:50 shielding
08:51 surrounded by superconducting shielding
08:54 it was a device to look for quarks
08:56 fundamental particles
08:58 and its claim to fame was that it was
09:00 totally imperturbable from the outside
09:04 so i took and go over there
09:06 and said
09:07 i'd like for you to perturb this device
09:10 he said where is it
09:12 well it's down there under the floor
09:14 inside that superconducting shielding
09:17 and so he asked well how will i know if
09:18 i'm successful
09:20 so he showed him a printout
09:22 that was generally being generated
09:25 and it was
09:26 it would go up and down
09:28 about once a minute
09:30 and that's how it runs standardly
09:33 and so i said what i'd like for you to
09:34 perturb it so he said well first i have
09:37 to see what's in there
09:40 and he began drawing and describing what
09:43 he saw down inside there and as he did
09:45 so
09:46 we saw this effect
09:49 and i said how'd you do that he said i
09:51 didn't do anything i just looked at it
09:54 i said well look at it again
09:57 and then this effect occurred
10:00 and of course a graduate student whose
10:02 thesis depended on this said stop there
10:04 must be something wrong with me
10:06 [Laughter]
10:09 so we
10:10 talked on other subjects and kind of
10:12 looked around and thought about other
10:14 things
10:15 and a few more cycles came out
10:19 and so he said well why don't you look
10:20 in there again
10:23 and then that's what happened
10:26 the grad student said well you know
10:28 i think something's wrong why don't you
10:30 guys just go away leave me alone for a
10:32 half hour so i got to look and see
10:33 what's what's the problem here
10:36 and so
10:37 that's
10:38 how it generated for the next 20 or 30 10:40 minutes or so
10:42 and
10:43 then we said okay why don't you look in
10:44 there again
10:46 and bingo
10:48 that's what happened
10:50 poor graduates about really tears hair
10:51 out he says i want you guys out of my
10:53 lab i've got to take some more data to
10:55 find out what's happening here
10:57 and so he ran for hours and there's no
11:00 other perturbation
11:03 so i thought this is pretty pretty
11:04 interesting and actually it's pretty
11:06 interesting that he could seemingly
11:07 describe what was in there because in
11:08 fact the innards of this device had
11:10 never been
11:12 published anywhere
11:14 so
11:15 i wrote this up and circulated it around
11:18 and after
11:20 a couple of
11:22 weeks
11:23 the cia landed on my doorstep
11:26 and said
11:27 have we been looking for you
11:30 and i said well
11:31 what did i do
11:33 i said well you did this experiment
11:36 and our problem is
11:38 that we have data indicating that the
11:40 soviets that's what we called them at
11:42 the time the soviets
11:44 are
11:45 spending millions of dollars a year on
11:47 this stuff
11:48 they've got some of the best institutes
11:50 and the best phds working on it
11:53 and nobody in america even believes
11:54 there is such a thing
11:56 so we don't know how to evaluate this
12:00 uh
12:01 do you think you could have him come out
12:02 and uh you know sort of demonstrate this
12:04 to us we'd like to really see if this
12:06 really
12:07 you know something to it we couldn't
12:09 care less about the cyclokinesis but
12:10 we're really interested in this what we
12:12 now call remote viewing aspect the fact
12:14 that he could see inside here
12:17 so i said okay so they they showed up
12:19 and go agreed
12:20 so they spent a couple of days hiding
12:22 things in boxes and envelopes
12:24 and they would bring him into the room
12:26 and he would describe what's what's in
12:28 there
12:29 one time they even tried to be a little
12:31 tricky
12:32 he came into the room and he said well
12:34 it looks like
12:36 a leaf or something but it's moving
12:38 around well they put in a moth that
12:40 looked like like a leaf
12:42 and i don't have that data because they
12:44 took the data away with them
12:49 but i'll show you some similar
12:50 experiments so why did they come and
12:53 land on my doorstep actually i have to
12:55 give you a little background here
12:57 following my master's degree
12:58 at the university of florida i went on
13:00 active duty as an intelligence officer
13:03 for the navy
13:04 involved at naval security group
13:05 headquarters and then out at fort meade
13:08 at national security agency
13:11 i like the job i had there when i got
13:13 out
13:15 i stayed on as a civilian
13:17 so they had me well calibrated i had
13:20 lots of clearances i've been polygraphed
13:22 et cetera et cetera
13:24 so i actually went out to stanford to
13:26 get my phd i was still an nsa employee
13:29 but after being in california for about
13:31 a year i said you know i really want to
13:33 go back
13:34 to laurel maryland and never be able to
13:37 publish anything i said i don't think so
13:39 so i resigned
13:42 graduated from stanford in 67 13:45 stayed there working on this textbook i
13:46 mentioned until 72 and then joined sri
13:49 early in 1972 and then that's when this
13:52 occurred very soon after i arrived there
13:57 the data they showed me
13:59 was about an inch thick listing all
14:02 these institutes all these phds all
14:05 these experiments
14:07 eventually it was published by the
14:08 defense intelligence agencies called
14:10 paraphysics r d warsaw pact
14:13 and i think you can obtain that on the
14:16 web these days it was finally pretty
14:18 much declassified
14:21 well as i say i don't have the actual
14:23 experimental data that we generated for
14:25 them
14:27 but soon after that
14:29 russell targe and i had done an
14:31 experiment with another remote viewer
14:33 who showed up hella hammet
14:35 and we did similar experiments with her
14:38 because we want to get our own data that
14:39 we could evaluate
14:42 now you may think i'm just showing you
14:43 the best data ever sweeping the bad data
14:46 under the rug this is actually the first
14:48 five experiments
14:50 that we did with her
14:51 in this particular protocol the protocol
14:54 was that we would hide an object
14:56 in a film can
14:58 and then she would have to describe what
15:00 she saw
15:02 so we put a spool and pin in there and
15:04 she sort of drew the cross section of a
15:05 spool
15:06 and a pen
15:08 put in a curled up leaf and she got
15:10 something curled up
15:12 this one really gave her a problem
15:13 because he said the strongest image i
15:15 get is of a leather belt and i know a
15:17 belt can't fit in a film can
15:19 it actually was a little leather belt
15:21 key ring
15:23 maybe difficult to see this but with
15:25 this case we just poured sand into the
15:27 can
15:28 and if you just look at the sand that's
15:30 the
15:31 characteristics that it actually has
15:34 so you can see why it was generating
15:36 data like that that that they would get
15:38 interested and so they started out by
15:42 just saying uh well about a little 50k
15:44 program 50 000 program to to see what
15:47 there is to this
15:49 so we said sure
15:51 why not
15:52 just a lark at the time i didn't know my
15:55 next 13 years were going to go into this
15:58 program
16:01 russell joined me
16:02 and
16:04 so at that point we decided we would
16:05 launch this program into what we called
16:09 remote viewing
16:10 a name that ingo came up with
16:13 and we started the way you would think
16:14 except we were sort of high tech about
16:16 it that is instead of hiding things and
16:18 envelopes or whatever
16:20 we would tend to like turn lasers on and
16:22 off in the next room and have him tell
16:24 you know
16:25 is the laser on is it off whatever
16:27 but we did do some
16:29 objects and boxes and
16:31 so on he said you know
16:33 you want to know what's in the box open
16:35 it up
16:37 if you wanna know what's in the envelope
16:38 tear it open
16:40 here i have this great ability
16:42 he's a very self-confident person
16:44 i have this great ability i can see
16:46 anywhere on the planet and you have me
16:48 doing this stupid stuff i think i'm
16:50 going to quit
16:52 well we really didn't want to quit
16:55 and of course we thought what he was
16:56 suggesting was ridiculous
16:59 so we finally agreed that okay on the
17:00 coffee breaks we'll do some of those
17:02 experiments just to get it out of your
17:04 system and then we'll go back to our
17:06 good scientific experiments
17:08 and so uh on our coffee breaks we'd say
17:11 well what do you want us to do well just
17:12 send somebody out to some area
17:15 someplace in the bay area and i'll draw
17:17 where they are
17:18 and so it turned out that
17:20 he was
17:22 coming up with really very successful
17:24 results
17:25 so we told our contract monitors at cia
17:28 that well you know it looks like you
17:29 know you can describe places that are
17:31 far away
17:33 so do you want us to look at that and i
17:34 said well of course
17:36 and so we started down that track
17:41 now here's a good remote viewing
17:42 experiment
17:44 of course you'd wish that all
17:45 experiments were this good they're not
17:47 all this good but we do get results like
17:50 this from time to time
17:51 this particular one was generated by joe
17:54 mcmonagle
17:55 later in the program who was one of the
17:59 army intelligence
18:00 viewers from the intelligence and
18:02 security command in fort meade
18:04 and you'd love for remote viewing to
18:06 always look like that
18:09 by the way here is joe
18:11 as you may know he continues to do
18:13 remote viewing
18:15 has written a number of books about his
18:17 experiences
18:19 but actually what i want to do here is
18:21 to actually show
18:23 the problems with remote viewing
18:25 and why it's not perfect
18:27 here is one that we did with helen
18:29 hammett
18:31 the one the woman who did the cans
18:34 experiment the canisters experiment
18:37 in this case i was sent out
18:39 to a remote site which turned out to be
18:41 an overpass over a freeway
18:44 russell stayed with her in the
18:46 laboratory and had her describe where i
18:49 was
18:50 and make drawings and she says well
18:53 there's something going by fast i don't
18:56 know what it is
18:58 of course it was the cars on the freeway
19:00 and she said you know if you stand where
19:02 he's standing it looks like that
19:04 it's sort of like a trough in the air
19:06 except
19:07 it's got holes in it so it couldn't
19:09 carry water
19:11 so here we began to see a pattern that
19:14 we saw throughout the program and
19:16 eventually became to understand quite
19:18 well and that is
19:20 these
19:21 pictures these
19:22 gestalts would come in
19:24 but the analysis
19:27 wouldn't necessarily follow
19:30 they wouldn't necessarily interpret what
19:32 it was that they saw
19:34 and that's why by the way your typical
19:36 thing you might challenge somebody with
19:38 if they claim to be psychics okay i'm
19:40 gonna write down some numbers here now
19:41 tell me what i've written down i mean it
19:42 just turns out that's that's not the
19:44 right kind of thing
19:47 about that time
19:49 another
19:50 remote viewer talented person
19:52 joined us pat price
19:54 i'll let you guess who the cia agent is
19:59 they call us the plaid pants trio
20:09 this is an empty experiment we had done
20:10 it we had done some experiments in which
20:14 the cia agent would
20:16 fly around in the glider
20:18 and pat on the ground would have to
20:20 reproduce drawings he made and vice
20:22 versa and we got some good results there
20:26 but again i want to show you
20:28 a problem with remote viewing
20:32 he says well
20:33 what turned out to be a swimming pool
20:35 complex
20:36 there's a circular pool about
20:39 i don't know 120 feet in diameter
20:42 it's really 110.
20:45 there's a square pool here about 60 by
20:47 89 feet it's really 75 by 100.
20:51 he had an almost perfect description of
20:53 this pool house
20:56 but in a way what's actually more
20:57 interesting about this and the reason i
20:59 show it is what's wrong with it we say
21:02 well what kind of place do you think it
21:03 is
21:04 he says well i think it's a water
21:06 purification plant
21:08 and so he added some
21:10 swirling machinery here in the middle
21:13 of the pools of water which of course
21:15 were not there
21:17 and he said you know i see a couple of
21:19 big tanks of water up here in the corner
21:22 also which as it turns out were not
21:24 there
21:25 so it seemed like there was a mixture of
21:30 real access to a target and then
21:32 imagination coming into play which is a
21:34 phenomenon we saw often
21:37 now what makes it a little more complex
21:39 is that
21:41 my colleague russell targe and looking
21:43 through some
21:47 history of palo alto found out that at
21:50 this location some decades before
21:54 there was a water purification plant
21:57 and it did have a couple of tanks of
21:59 water
22:01 so
22:01 you know
22:02 what are you going to do with that
22:08 now in case again you think that i'm
22:10 kind of
22:11 showing you some good results and
22:13 brushing the rest under the rug
22:16 the
22:18 sri management was very concerned about
22:20 this kind of work
22:23 word that we would ruin the reputation
22:24 of sri
22:26 got a very skeptical panel of scientists
22:29 within sri to help us develop a protocol
22:32 and so on the protocol that was
22:34 developed was this they said you know if
22:36 somebody goes out with a transcript in
22:38 hand to the target and says oh the sky
22:41 is blue grass is green this is a great
22:43 match
22:44 you know that's not going to mean
22:44 anything
22:46 so the scheme we came up with was
22:49 that judges who did not know which
22:51 transcript went with which target
22:55 would go out with all the transcripts
22:57 randomly numbered
22:59 and visit each of the sites
23:02 so they go to hoover tower and they'd
23:04 say well transcript number five matches
23:06 best transcript number one matches
23:08 second best transcript number two sort
23:10 of third best and the rest are all sort
23:12 of
23:14 the same
23:15 and then they would go to the next site
23:17 and read the same transcripts all over
23:18 again
23:21 and you can see it wasn't always great i
23:23 mean hoover tower he had the name hoover
23:25 tower
23:26 the marina he named that there were
23:28 boats along the dock so i mean how could
23:30 they miss
23:31 but the bridge toll plaza actually what
23:34 he described was one of the more
23:36 miserable kinds of matches so even with
23:38 the
23:40 wonderful stuff he could do from time to
23:41 time it wasn't always
23:43 great
23:45 but to make long story short when we
23:47 finally break the code we find the seven
23:49 of the nine times even though the
23:51 descriptions weren't perfect
23:53 you could go
23:54 and you knew somebody had been kidnapped
23:56 nine times and you're asked to go
23:59 uh and try to find this person
24:02 uh let's see one two three four five six
24:05 seven
24:07 six of the nine times if i've counted
24:09 right
24:10 uh you would have gone to the correct
24:12 place first simply based on what the
24:15 remote viewer said
24:17 so
24:19 uh there's just no doubt in this blind
24:21 judging procedure which then became
24:24 the technique that's used by our lab and
24:26 then now many other labs that have
24:27 replicated it
24:29 replicated this work including princeton
24:31 engineering laboratories have done now
24:33 some 20 years or more of research on
24:35 this getting the same kind of results
24:42 we wondered what is it with these people
24:46 they must be different
24:49 so we decided to find out
24:52 what are they like medically
24:55 this even included
24:57 seven layer emi brain scans
25:01 and the answer came back
25:03 they're just normal people
25:05 so in our wisdom we said oh
25:08 well
25:09 it must be neuropsychological or
25:10 psychological
25:13 so we ran through all these tests
25:16 the time we finished with them we knew
25:17 more about them than nasa knew about its
25:19 astronauts
25:22 and it had its funny minutes moments i
25:24 recall hearing from the psychologist
25:26 that was giving pat price
25:30 his psychology interview and
25:32 asked him about early memories and he
25:34 says well do you want me to just stick
25:36 to this lifetime
25:42 again what we found in these studies was
25:44 these these people were perfectly normal
25:46 nothing really special
25:48 well this solved a problem for us of
25:50 great magnitude
25:53 we began to realize that maybe this is
25:54 something that's widely distributed
25:56 maybe anybody can do it
26:00 about that time
26:01 as we were reporting these results back
26:03 to cia headquarters they were getting
26:05 nervous
26:07 they were concerned that maybe it was a
26:08 scam involving us
26:10 you know maybe really told them in
26:12 advance where we're going to go
26:14 so they decided to send out their most
26:17 super skeptic they could find
26:20 this guy shows up and he says
26:22 my name is ed
26:23 but you can call me scambuster
26:26 i'm here to find out
26:28 exactly how you guys are doing this
26:30 fraudulently
26:32 yeah okay okay
26:34 well let me see one of these experiments
26:36 so we do an experiment
26:39 he goes with me out to the side russell
26:42 stays back in interviews
26:44 we come back
26:45 the remote viewers really nailed where
26:47 we were
26:49 so we're really happy
26:51 but scam buster says
26:54 you just told him in advance
26:56 let me pick the site
26:58 fine you pick the site
27:00 so we do another experiment he picks a
27:02 site
27:04 we get back
27:06 another great
27:08 report
27:10 so he's mumbling to himself he knows
27:12 it's a scam he says okay
27:14 maybe you had a bug in your car
27:17 or
27:19 that that could be it okay we're going
27:20 to go in my car this time i'm going to
27:22 pick the site again
27:23 and we're not going to talk in the car
27:25 okay fine fine
27:28 so we go out to the site
27:30 we're there for 15 minutes
27:32 and he says quick
27:34 get my car we're going to go to
27:36 someplace else
27:37 we said well wait a minute experiment's
27:39 supposed to last half an hour
27:41 it's okay
27:42 you guys may have had somebody follow us
27:44 and now you're telling them so i want to
27:46 pick another site right in the middle of
27:47 the experiment
27:48 meanwhile the poor remote viewers saying
27:51 you know we're only 15 minutes in the
27:53 experiment they're getting in the car
27:54 already
27:57 anyway he describes both places really
27:59 well
28:02 he says i know it's a fraud let me think
28:03 about it overnight okay fine
28:06 meanwhile russell and i get together we
28:08 say you know we've got a hard case here
28:11 our only hope is since we've learned
28:14 that sort of anybody can do it
28:17 to some degree let's make him do it
28:19 tomorrow
28:21 so he shows up
28:23 i mean you're not going to believe what
28:24 i'm about to tell you he shows up
28:27 says okay where's the remote viewer we
28:29 say well today you're going to be the
28:30 remote viewer
28:32 he said you got to be kidding i don't
28:33 believe in this stuff he said it much
28:35 more strongly than that
28:40 i said well
28:42 try it i mean at least you'll be able to
28:43 report back to your human subjects panel
28:45 that it's not stressful or whatever he
28:47 says okay finally we twisted his army
28:49 agreed to do it
28:51 so i'm sent out to a site
28:53 russell's interviewing him
28:55 says okay you know close your eyes and
28:58 tell me what you see it says okay my
29:00 eyes are closed it's dark i see the back
29:02 of my eyelids
29:05 so russ says well i mean you have to use
29:07 your imagination you've got to get into
29:09 this and says oh imagination i've got a
29:11 great imagination i see him at a bridge
29:13 over a stream but it's just my
29:14 imagination
29:16 so i come back from the bridge over the
29:18 stream target
29:19 [Laughter]
29:21 we take him there
29:24 he is really blown away
29:26 as you can imagine but as we're driving
29:28 back in the car he says i know it's a
29:29 fraud
29:31 we said well wait a minute you did it
29:34 he says i know but i i know how you got
29:37 me to do that
29:39 we're going to do another experiment i
29:40 don't want any interviewer with me
29:43 i want to do another experiment okay
29:45 so put him in the room by himself
29:47 tape the door shut because we don't
29:48 believe him anymore you believe and
29:50 trust him anymore he trusts us
29:53 we're sent out to our site
29:55 we stay there
29:56 our point of time we come back
29:58 take the tape off the door go inside
30:01 he's sitting in the corner with his
30:03 hands over his ears
30:05 by the way in his clipboard he's got a
30:07 great description of where we were
30:10 and we said well what's this sitting in
30:11 the corner with your hands over yours
30:13 and
30:14 why don't you want somebody with you to
30:15 interview i mean it goes better that way
30:18 he said well i had two hypotheses
30:21 the first hypothesis was that
30:24 russell knew the target
30:25 and so he was carefully cueing me with
30:28 body language into putting down the
30:29 right answers that's why i didn't want
30:31 an interviewer with me
30:33 my second idea
30:35 was that
30:36 in the chair you had me sitting in you
30:38 probably had speakers in the cushions
30:41 and they were subliminally whispering a
30:42 description of the site
30:44 and i was picking it up and putting it
30:45 down
30:47 i said well
30:49 you know that's not the case so you see
30:51 it really works right it says no no no
30:54 i have figured out how you do it
30:56 he said well what
30:59 he says let's do another experiment
31:02 this time when you're at your site you
31:04 take pictures
31:06 you make tape recordings and when you
31:08 come back you give me your data pack
31:10 before i show you what i've drawn
31:13 all right all right we'll do that
31:16 on our tape you can hear the kids uh
31:18 playing with the merry-go-round
31:21 uh
31:22 here are his drawings you know he's got
31:24 his thing
31:25 in pie shaped sections which i don't
31:27 know if you can see here but it is
31:29 he has these which sort of match this
31:32 on the other hand
31:33 again we see
31:35 misinterpretation in terms of
31:38 his analysis of it he thought of some
31:40 kind of cupula
31:41 which it isn't
31:44 and we say okay what was the deal you
31:45 wanted to see our data package first and
31:48 he said i finally figured out the only
31:50 remaining possibility is that when you
31:52 guys left you didn't go anywhere you
31:54 just sat in the lobby
31:56 then you would come back see what i had
31:58 drawn and take me to a place that looks
32:00 like that
32:03 anyway he was now convinced
32:06 so he went back reported headquarters
32:09 that this stuff really works
32:12 so of course they were now concerned
32:14 that he was part of the scan
32:21 or we slip something in his coffee
32:24 or use hypnosis i don't know
32:28 so about that time it was decided well
32:31 one of our contract monitors at cia said
32:34 okay well to to make it so that people
32:37 don't think we're part of this
32:39 i'm going to go to somebody else in cia
32:41 have them pick a target
32:44 they're not to tell me who what it is
32:47 and when they pick it
32:48 i'm just going to give them coordinates
32:50 of the target turns out coordinates work
32:51 as well as sending somebody to a site as
32:53 crazy as that is and we don't have time
32:55 to go into it but anyway that works too
32:58 and so those results that we gotten to
33:00 date
33:01 up to that point including
33:03 the cia person
33:05 uh we published in or we sent in to be
33:08 published at in to the proceedings the
33:10 ieee institute of electroelectronics
33:13 engineers
33:15 both russ and i are well known we had
33:16 published were members of the society of
33:19 engineers we had published articles on
33:22 electron tubes and so on
33:25 and then the poor editor gets this paper
33:27 on remote viewing
33:29 he sends it out for review
33:32 by and large the reviews come back very
33:34 positive
33:36 and then uh but he got one review where
33:39 someone said this is the kind of thing i
33:40 wouldn't believe in even if it were true
33:44 so he didn't know what to do
33:47 so when we asked him about it he said
33:48 well i'm afraid the engineers will just
33:50 you know really think this is nonsense
33:53 and i i don't think i can afford to go
33:55 ahead so what we propose is why don't
33:57 you let us come to bell labs
33:59 we'll make a presentation to the
34:01 engineering staff if they like it
34:03 publish it if they don't like it don't
34:05 so we did that
34:08 and they loved it
34:10 so we thought we were in
34:12 he was still concerned about it
34:14 and finally in our frustration now that
34:16 we learned to do this we said okay
34:18 do your own experiments here in bell
34:19 labs
34:20 if they work publish our paper and if
34:22 they don't don't
34:24 so he did
34:25 they worked
34:26 and he let us publish the paper
34:29 in that paper we put down all of the
34:32 experiments we've done to date
34:35 in the paper you'll see
34:37 the phrase visitor one visitor two
34:40 visitor three
34:42 now it can be told that those are
34:43 acronyms
34:44 for cia
34:46 agents even experiment which only they
34:49 were involved themselves uh turned out
34:52 to be statistically significant
34:54 as i started to say there was a problem
34:56 with people
34:58 back at the agency
35:00 feeling that you know maybe there was uh
35:03 some collusion even with them
35:06 and so that's when
35:08 one of our contract monitors went and
35:10 got
35:11 a target site from somebody else so that
35:13 he wouldn't know what it was so nobody
35:14 could accuse him of being part of it
35:19 and what the fellow had given him were
35:21 coordinates of a vacation cabin in west
35:23 virginia
35:25 so we had two remote viewers looked at
35:27 this
35:28 ingo swan and pat price
35:32 they both started out saying well
35:34 there's not much here you know the woods
35:37 some cabins and
35:39 but what the
35:40 person who gave him the coordinates
35:42 didn't know was right over the ridge
35:44 was a super secret nsa facility
35:48 and so both of them said oh that must be
35:51 what they want us to describe
35:53 so ingo gives
35:55 a description of what it looks at looks
35:58 like and how it's all laid out
36:01 pat price got really excited about this
36:04 site decided to wander through the
36:06 facility
36:08 reading name tags
36:12 and he said words just popped into his
36:14 mind so he wrote down a whole list of
36:15 words
36:19 well this was eventually written up
36:22 in uh
36:24 studies in intelligence originally
36:26 classified cia article
36:29 pat price who had no military
36:31 intelligence background provided a list
36:32 of project titles associated with
36:34 current and past activities including
36:36 one of extreme sensitivity also the code
36:39 name of the site was provided
36:42 well as you can imagine this brought the
36:43 entire
36:44 law enforcement apparatus of the united
36:46 states down around our necks
36:49 they said how did you get this
36:50 information
36:52 oh our remote viewers did it don't give
36:54 me that who leaked this
36:57 and so began a five-year
37:00 investigation
37:02 even this has its peculiar aspects
37:04 really the only thing classified about
37:06 the program was who we were doing it for
37:08 and why we were doing it and the fact
37:10 that there was a classified aspect to it
37:13 and meanwhile the investigators are
37:15 going all around the neighborhood saying
37:16 wow you know what's the personality does
37:18 this person drink does it
37:21 so everybody comes up to me in this
37:23 process and says well you must be doing
37:24 something really secret which of course
37:26 was the only secret that we had was that
37:28 we were doing something secret
37:30 it's a left hand in the right hand
37:31 business
37:33 but what saved us
37:35 was that
37:37 john mcmahon who was a division directed
37:39 time eventually became deputy director
37:41 of cia said well if this stuff really
37:42 works let's not waste it on our sites
37:47 so we were given
37:48 a soviet site to look at all we were
37:50 given were coordinates
37:54 pat price was the remote viewer in this
37:55 case
37:57 he described kind of this layout here
38:00 and then he said you know
38:02 i'm lying on my back on the top of a
38:04 building in this humongous crane
38:07 that's many stories talls rolling over
38:09 the building
38:11 a man is only half a wheel height that's
38:13 so big
38:15 well i must admit i was really
38:16 embarrassed to see this result
38:18 because it sounded like science fiction
38:20 to me
38:21 and
38:23 the agents were waiting in a motel so i
38:24 went over and i started with apologies
38:26 i'm sorry i mean he's come up with this
38:28 science fiction thing and what can i say
38:31 well here's what the site actually looks
38:32 like
38:33 there's the building there's the crane
38:36 there's a man
38:39 so in fact
38:41 it was quite as he described
38:44 here you can see the sort of comparison
38:49 and so they said well this is it this is
38:51 good stuff and so they spent a week with
38:54 him having him wander around the
38:55 facility and describe you know what he
38:57 found in there and so
38:58 on one of the things he described that
39:01 one of the main aspects of this facility
39:03 was they were making these
39:05 large 60-foot spheres
39:08 had some
39:10 some kind of purpose didn't know quite
39:12 what
39:13 it turned out that was the main aspect
39:15 of this
39:16 place he said that it was made in these
39:19 crescent-shaped sections and then put
39:21 together a low thermal epoxy well it
39:23 turned out that they had developed not a
39:25 low thermal epoxy but a low temperature
39:26 welding process
39:28 to build all these things
39:30 it was actually a project
39:33 to test some propulsion for space flight
39:36 that's what it actually was
39:39 well this is all fine for our clients
39:42 but you know we weren't getting very far
39:44 in getting uh scientific data that we
39:47 can analyze ourselves because
39:49 uh you know they take the data way into
39:51 disappears into a black hole and we
39:52 don't get all that much feedback so we
39:54 decided well we should do experiments of
39:57 our own over long distances gather our
39:59 own data
40:00 and i can show you hundreds of those
40:03 but actually what i'm going to show you
40:05 are a couple of experiments
40:07 that
40:08 show that
40:11 despite what you may think and despite
40:12 what many critics think
40:14 it is not the case that people describe
40:16 what they think is probably at the site
40:20 let me show you two examples a good
40:22 examples
40:23 where
40:24 the interviewer and the viewer were
40:26 certain they were wrong
40:28 tried to erase what they were getting
40:30 couldn't finally put it down knowing
40:33 they were wrong and it turned out they
40:34 were right
40:38 by the way this is all done not because
40:41 we were attempting to
40:43 develop psychic spying uh to begin with
40:46 but basically to evaluate
40:49 are we subject to a threat
40:51 by potential adversaries and so many of
40:55 our documents have titles like threat
40:58 technology assessment
41:02 well this is an experiment in which i
41:04 was in san jose costa rica as the
41:06 outbound experimenter each day i would
41:08 go to a different site and agreed upon
41:10 time
41:11 but in the middle of the series i had a
41:13 chance to do a trick
41:16 to jump on a plane fly out of costa rica
41:18 land on this island
41:20 just in time for
41:24 the experiment
41:26 the poor remote viewer
41:27 is saying well
41:29 i've got a problem here
41:31 i see him in airport he shouldn't be in
41:33 an airport not only that but i see ocean
41:35 at the end of the runway and i know he's
41:37 100 miles from the ocean
41:39 let me see if i can block this out and
41:41 now it just keeps coming back i just
41:43 guess i'm going to have to agree that
41:44 i'm wrong and just put it down
41:47 in fact that's exactly where i was
41:51 now turns out there's an extra little
41:53 interesting aspect of this experiment
41:55 the remote viewer that was supposed to
41:56 do the experiment didn't show up that
41:57 day
41:58 and so russell targ who was the
42:00 interviewer actually was the remote
42:02 viewer that did this experiment
42:06 a second experiment i was the
42:07 interviewer russell was running around
42:09 the united states
42:11 going to different cities
42:13 and of course i didn't know where he was
42:15 and
42:16 these are all double-blind experiments
42:19 and i'm interviewing the remote viewer
42:21 and he's sitting there he's not saying
42:22 anything i said well what are you
42:23 getting he says i'm not going to tell
42:24 you
42:26 i said what do you mean you're not going
42:27 to tell me
42:28 you know i mean this is an experiment
42:29 you've got to tell me
42:31 he said what i'm getting is so
42:32 ridiculous it can't be right so i don't
42:34 want to tell you
42:36 so i had to remind him it was an
42:37 expensive experiment
42:40 so he finally said okay you really want
42:42 to know what i see so of course i see a
42:45 big flying saucer sitting in the middle
42:46 of a city
42:48 i'll say well i see your problem but
42:54 it turned out that this where russell
42:56 was was a louisiana superdome
43:01 and of course once he began to draw it
43:02 it became clear that well
43:05 it wasn't exactly like a flying saucer
43:07 he has glass sides and so on so
43:10 again these are two examples uh where
43:13 the remote viewer and the interviewer
43:16 just didn't think it could be possible
43:17 and yet nonetheless uh there were
43:19 matches
43:21 another reason we were doing these long
43:22 distance experiments
43:24 was that the russians had published a
43:26 paper saying well they thought it was
43:28 low frequency brainwave stuff
43:30 and therefore over longer and longer
43:32 distances it should degrade
43:35 so that's why we wanted to do long
43:36 distance experiments but we didn't
43:38 really see any degradation here
43:43 we had another opportunity though
43:46 because another aspect
43:48 is that if it were low frequency brain
43:50 waves
43:53 you can't get shielding against that
43:54 very well in a shielded room but if you
43:56 put somebody in the submarine and sink
43:57 them in the ocean
43:59 that'll work but you know we didn't
44:00 think there's any chance for us to do
44:02 something like that
44:03 well as it turns out our conference host
44:06 stephen schwartz had been pursuing a
44:09 parallel path since his navy days
44:12 about remote viewing
44:14 and he was carrying out various
44:16 experiments and specifically interested
44:18 in looking at this low frequency aspect
44:22 because in fact
44:24 project sanguine was a big issue back in
44:26 those days to try to communicate to
44:28 submarines and you can only use low
44:29 frequency
44:31 waves to do it so there's a question of
44:33 how deep could your submersible go and
44:35 so on so as it turns out stephen had
44:37 arranged through some friends of his to
44:40 get access to
44:42 this submersible
44:44 built by hico
44:46 company
44:48 and so we merged our projects together
44:50 and said okay well let's let's
44:52 collaborate on this because we're very
44:53 interested in following up with this
44:55 hypothesis also
44:57 so two of our remote viewers ingo swann
45:00 and hella hammett uh were the remote
45:03 viewers to go on the submarine get
45:05 submerged in the ocean
45:07 where
45:08 it was deep enough
45:10 60 db for the engineers in the crown
45:13 that
45:14 if in fact
45:15 it was low frequency brain waves they
45:18 probably would be snuffed out with that
45:20 much water
45:22 we had a chance to do a couple of
45:23 experiments
45:25 ingo's experiment when he was on board
45:28 the submarine
45:30 the site that was chosen
45:32 uh
45:34 turned out to
45:35 end up being a very upscale
45:38 shopping mall that inside the shopping
45:41 mall had
45:42 water wheel and water running and lots
45:44 of vegetation and so on
45:49 and basically
45:50 ingo's description
45:52 describes just this kind of place
45:57 he even notices the pool of water for
45:59 example and the red stone flooring which
46:02 if you had color pictures here you could
46:04 tell
46:05 now there's another element of this we
46:07 were looking to see if you could
46:08 communicate messages to submarines so
46:10 you might think you want to go to your
46:11 chalkboard and write down
46:13 submerge or fire missiles well that's
46:16 too analytical
46:18 so what you could do is take a whole
46:20 series of cards
46:22 write down a whole series of
46:24 sites
46:25 turn the cards over and write down the
46:28 message you want to get across
46:30 and then when a remote viewer does a
46:32 remote viewing then you hand in the
46:34 cards he reads down the list and says
46:36 well that's that's the one i think i saw
46:37 then you turn it over and you can see
46:39 the message
46:40 well swann was able to pick out among
46:42 the set the correct match so we were
46:45 able to send a message
46:48 hella hammered
46:50 despite being seasick
46:55 also did really very well as it turns
46:58 out this was kind of a nothing sight in
47:00 a way i mean it was an oak tree up on a
47:02 hillside
47:03 which she described
47:05 and
47:06 so to give a little action i kind of
47:09 jumped around in the branches
47:11 she said i see how cavorting about in a
47:13 very unscientific like fashion
47:17 and again when she was presented with a
47:19 list of
47:21 potential sites she had no problem
47:23 picking out the right one and therefore
47:24 getting the message
47:26 well this seemed definitely to shoot
47:28 down the electromagnetic hypothesis
47:31 i'm very grateful for
47:34 stephen for having provided us this
47:35 opportunity and then he went on he'll
47:38 probably describe it to do some
47:40 remote viewing of underwater
47:42 archaeological sites
47:44 with them
47:46 trying to find some submerged in this
47:48 case
47:50 shipwrecks and so on
47:52 so
47:53 still
47:54 we want to press the limits
47:56 another feature of the idea that it
47:58 might be low frequency brainwaves would
48:01 be that if you got the smaller and
48:02 smaller targets
48:04 it would be harder and harder because
48:05 you wouldn't have the resolution you
48:06 needed
48:09 so we dropped down from outdoor sites to
48:12 smaller laboratory equipment sites
48:16 we had the typewriter a couple of times
48:20 ingo got this
48:22 hella drew that
48:24 by now they've gotten sophisticated
48:26 enough to know they shouldn't try to
48:27 interpret what it is they're seeing
48:30 they just put down what they thought
48:32 they saw and
48:34 they both came up with some kind of
48:36 keyboard instruments but they didn't
48:38 label it as a typewriter but
48:40 of course that was good enough
48:43 in this case a computer room was the
48:46 target
48:47 hella drew a very good
48:50 description of this it even has this
48:52 along the side although you can't see in
48:54 the picture
48:55 again though when we asked her what she
48:57 thought it was she thought well maybe it
48:59 was a washing machine
49:01 so again the analysis
49:03 doesn't quite go
49:04 so we we figure out that this is right
49:06 brain left brain functioning and so on
49:08 and this is mostly a right hemispheric
49:10 kind of phenomena meanwhile scan buster
49:14 is there
49:15 doing an experiment he's even trying to
49:16 figure out the brand name of the
49:17 teletype
49:20 remoteview is not perfect you got it
49:22 wrong he thought it was a
49:23 texas instrument silent 700 and it was
49:25 another brand
49:27 but still
49:28 he did all right
49:31 we then decided
49:33 let's go to micro dots
49:36 one millimeter by one millimeter
49:39 pictures
49:40 hello hammond was the remote viewer for
49:42 this series
49:43 so the first micro dot was of a ski
49:46 resort
49:48 so she says you know white large area
49:51 could be a mound mountain in circle by
49:52 highway snow-covered hillock
49:55 white mountain with lines natural but it
49:57 was used and adapted to fit it out with
49:59 some machinery
50:01 which is about as
50:02 good a description as you can get
50:06 the microdot of the hand
50:09 she came up
50:10 with
50:12 lots of earth colors brown
50:15 you can wonder about that i mean
50:18 these micro dots
50:20 are sealed up and there's not any light
50:22 in there
50:23 but anyway we're getting colors again
50:26 she can't tell that it's a hand
50:29 but she definitely has five protrusions
50:30 coming out of
50:32 out of a mass
50:33 and so she did several in this series
50:35 the entire series was judged and turned
50:37 out to be statistically significant so
50:40 in our mind this pretty much ruled out
50:42 uh
50:43 the electromagnetic hypothesis
50:45 so a lot of people have asked well what
50:46 have we learned about how this works
50:49 well what we've learned so far
50:51 is all the ways
50:53 can't explain it
50:54 [Laughter]
50:56 but i guess that's progress
51:00 another element we wanted to check out
51:02 though was
51:04 what happens i mean instead of half hour
51:06 experiments or whatever you let somebody
51:07 work on something like this
51:10 for a whole day do they tire
51:12 does it
51:13 sort of dissipate or can you keep them
51:15 on target for a whole day because for
51:17 operational cases you really wanted to
51:19 do that
51:20 it also turned out along the way that it
51:22 was discovered that even though you
51:24 think the information might come in
51:26 visually
51:27 typically it doesn't
51:30 actually the visual part is usually
51:32 imagination
51:33 it tends to come in what we call
51:35 kinesthetically
51:37 you get a feeling for what the sight is
51:39 and the feeling for the shapes and
51:42 eventually those feelings will result in
51:43 pictures but if you get pictures
51:44 immediately usually it's often it's not
51:47 correct so one of the techniques we used
51:49 along the way was to do clay models
51:54 so in this particular case
51:56 a day long experiment involved
51:58 ingo swann as the remote viewer
52:01 the target was a sylvania manufacturing
52:04 facility
52:06 10 or 15 miles away
52:09 and so his first thing was to build the
52:11 clay model
52:13 he says well there's kind of funny round
52:14 building here on the right he built
52:17 in this squarish building with some
52:19 arches
52:20 and he had this diagonal thing in the
52:22 back it turns out there was a diagonal
52:24 greenhouse back there
52:28 so i
52:29 i'm the interviewer in this case i said
52:30 okay well tell me about this
52:35 and so he does his best to draw it out
52:38 85 feet by 30 feet of course you realize
52:40 that's
52:41 really too small
52:43 the word aerator came to mind i don't
52:45 know if that's sort of like a freudian
52:46 slip i mean it's not an aerator but it
52:48 is an air inflated building
52:51 as he's drawing it he says i know this
52:53 sounds strange but the building is
52:54 blowing up and getting bigger and bigger
52:58 i mean it wasn't at the time but of
52:59 course that's how they construct this
53:00 building
53:01 so he wrote getting bigger and bigger
53:03 and he made another drawing and
53:06 it's more to scale to what it actually
53:08 looks like
53:12 so i say okay well that's about as much
53:14 as that so tell me about this building
53:17 so he redraws this
53:19 as he's drawing it he says you know
53:22 this isn't exactly right i've got round
53:24 arches here but i think they're more
53:25 squared
53:27 which of course they are
53:30 he then redraws it
53:34 by the way as a left right reversals we
53:35 often see the antennas on the right yes
53:37 and on the left
53:39 so i say well okay tell me what's going
53:41 on inside the building
53:43 so he draws a path to go in
53:46 and he says well
53:49 it's something they're building it's
53:50 about the size of an automobile
53:54 it's got
53:55 gases running into it
53:57 i see
53:59 what looks like flames leaping off in
54:01 segmented sections
54:04 and what in fact it was was a
54:08 carbon dioxide laser high power
54:11 infrared laser
54:13 it does have
54:15 segmented sections there is plasma
54:17 discharge that in fact does look like
54:21 flames
54:22 we asked him what he thought it was he
54:24 said well if i had to guess if i had to
54:26 try to figure out i think it's a
54:27 crematorium
54:30 of course it isn't
54:31 we took him to see it
54:33 and by the way when it's running there's
54:35 a plexiglass top and a mirror here and
54:37 you look down it does look like flames
54:39 in there and they are segmented off and
54:41 it does have gas coming into it
54:43 his only comment was
54:45 i'd expect me to know what this is
54:47 remote viewing i don't even know what it
54:48 is when i'm looking at it
54:55 along the way people have said well have
54:57 you ever done anything in remote viewing
54:58 that actually may have made a difference
55:00 may have contributed to something
55:02 i'd like to give a couple examples of
55:04 that
55:06 when
55:08 during the carter administration it was
55:10 being considered that we should have
55:11 what was called the
55:13 mx missile system the shell game we're
55:16 going to have a series of silos and
55:18 trains were going to run the missiles
55:20 around from one silo to the next
55:22 and that was going to be the big deal
55:24 so we said ah that sounds like a job for
55:26 rv man
55:29 so
55:31 we arranged to
55:33 collaborate with actually charlie tart
55:35 in this case i know this is a complex
55:38 view graph and you don't have to pay
55:39 attention to hardly any of it the only
55:41 thing i want you to notice is
55:44 that there are 12 55:46 graphs here and each time you see
55:48 something going up the top
55:52 so what we did was we simulated
55:55 this result or this
55:58 kind of a system that is we had
56:00 uh a monitor
56:04 10 circles
56:07 a random number generator would say
56:09 which was the hot circle but of course
56:11 not display it and the remote viewer
56:13 would have to push a key to say which
56:15 one they thought it was
56:16 and then we did a lot of statistical
56:18 averaging to see
56:20 how it all came out make a long story
56:22 short
56:23 12 times in a row
56:26 odds of one in a trillion
56:28 we got the hidden missile silo
56:32 in the simulation and there were no
56:34 mistakes
56:35 so we forwarded that
56:38 and
56:39 as it turns out at that time we were
56:40 working directly for
56:43 some people in the national security
56:44 council
56:45 and they told carter about this
56:49 and eventually the program was scrapped
56:51 i don't know that was scrapped because
56:52 of this but certainly this was one of
56:54 the inputs to
56:56 whatever other considerations they had
56:58 so it may have had some
57:00 influence
57:02 a second experiment
57:04 where we know we had influence
57:06 was during the
57:09 iranian hostage crisis during the carter
57:11 administration
57:14 every now and then ayatollah khamenei
57:16 would say oh we're going to release a
57:17 hostage
57:19 so everybody get all excited they'd gear
57:21 up they'd send a medical team over to
57:22 frankfurt they'd wait and nothing would
57:24 happen no one would get released
57:26 so after that happened several times
57:29 the white house position was just sort
57:30 of ho-hum
57:32 and so once again turned out comedian
57:35 said i'm going to release
57:36 a hostage
57:38 well
57:39 they were going to pay attention to that
57:41 but since we were working directly for
57:42 somebody in national security council
57:43 and they heard about this they decided
57:45 to
57:46 see what the remote viewers might say
57:48 and so
57:50 we were asked to give a profile on an
57:53 individual this is a kind of thing that
57:55 we often did
57:57 we had no idea that had anything to do
57:58 with a hostage crisis
58:00 usually when they asked us to do that it
58:02 was about some head of state
58:04 these were always done blind so anyway
58:07 we
58:09 did the experiment one of our one of our
58:11 remote viewers keith ferrari
58:13 first he came up with a physical
58:15 description
58:17 and it turned out to match
58:19 one of the hostages
58:20 very precisely
58:22 he then gave a psychological profile
58:25 which turned out to match
58:27 the hostage that eventually was released
58:30 very well
58:31 and he also gave a medical condition
58:33 medical profile
58:35 and just as a sort of an afterthought in
58:38 the experiment
58:39 the remote viewer said well this guy is
58:41 really sick he's so sick
58:43 and yet i see him on a plane when he
58:45 should be in a hospital in a couple of
58:46 days and he practically dies from the
58:48 vertigo looking out the window
58:51 so anyway we forwarded that
58:53 based on that
58:55 the white house decided that they would
58:57 send the team over because
58:59 this
59:00 data seemed to be pretty good
59:02 and in fact hostage richard queen was
59:04 released
59:06 he had multiple sclerosis that was being
59:08 exacerbated by the stress
59:11 and so he did get released
59:13 eventually
59:14 the national security council guy sat
59:17 down with hostage queen
59:19 to debrief him and he said well i have a
59:21 source here i can't reveal
59:22 but i just want to read this transcript
59:25 and you tell me how accurate it is
59:27 because i'm trying to evaluate him
59:29 and so as he started reading down this
59:31 list queen got more and more irate
59:34 finally he leaped out of his chair and
59:36 he said the only reason the only way you
59:37 could have known that data was if my
59:39 guard was your source and if that's the
59:41 case why didn't get me out there sooner
59:47 well what do people really think about
59:48 this
59:50 cia finally admitted
59:53 that they were doing this
59:56 the army chief of staff for intelligence
59:57 for the army
60:00 heard a briefing by us
60:02 and decided to set up a small in-house
60:04 program
60:05 with
60:06 army intelligence officers as remote
60:08 viewers
60:09 and you'll be hearing from
60:12 several of them actually are a couple of
60:13 them during this conference
60:17 this was a great experiment that we were
60:18 successful with which we thought and
60:20 we're told would never see the light of
60:22 day but it just turned out that after
60:25 carter left office he was giving a
60:27 speech to
60:29 a college crowd in georgia
60:32 and somebody said well
60:33 whatever happened in your administration
60:35 that you think was like really
60:37 unexpected and strange he said well you
60:39 know we lost a plane in zaire
60:41 and
60:43 cia directors turner stansville turner
60:46 turned to a remote viewer and she said
60:48 where it was and we went in and we got
60:50 it
60:50 so this was great
60:53 they went in on the basis of what the
60:55 removers said and as they got there the
60:57 two remote viewers working on this
60:59 outward coming natives carrying pieces
61:02 of the wreckage and of course we were
61:03 trying to get to it the russians were
61:04 trying to get to it
61:05 but we got there first in this case
61:07 helped by remote viewers
61:13 the american institutes of report on
61:15 stargate
61:16 finally
61:18 fessed up to the fact that
61:21 even from just 1986 to 1995 the more
61:24 more than 200 tasks of operational
61:26 remote viewing
61:29 by military organizations request that
61:31 we requested remote viewing help and
61:34 they were generating data
61:36 now at this time there's also
61:38 controversy about
61:39 well was this stuff really good was it
61:41 helping was it not helping etc
61:43 this is about the time that the cold war
61:45 ended and things were winding down
61:48 and so joe mcmonagle released
61:51 the
61:52 content of his legion of merit award
61:56 in which he
61:58 which he got for providing over 150 62:01 essential elements of information
62:03 reporting the joint chiefs of staff dia
62:06 nsa cia and secret service producing
62:10 crucial and vital intelligence
62:11 unavailable from any other source
62:16 well
62:19 are people still interested
62:21 they are still interested even though
62:22 the program has a large
62:24 high profile
62:26 program has won down
62:30 just uh recently this is a
62:33 summer of uh
62:35 what 2000 2001.
62:38 the journal of u.s intelligence studies
62:41 wanted to run some
62:44 a reprieve on the remote viewing work
62:46 and so they reprinted an article i had
62:49 written earlier
62:50 because there was such interest
62:55 not too long after that i was approached
62:58 by a navy seal
63:00 who's writing a thesis at the marine war
63:02 college
63:04 and he decided he wanted to write a
63:06 thesis on the development of remote
63:08 viewing in the military intelligence
63:10 community
63:11 and why we should get it going again
63:14 and so he wrote a very strong thesis we
63:16 were able to put him in touch with
63:19 previous
63:21 contract monitors and
63:23 program directors
63:24 and so that's circulating around the
63:27 system
63:30 of course this is all kind of heavy or
63:31 whatever but there's also a light side
63:33 to remote viewing
63:36 about this time my wife and i were
63:40 providing funding getting together
63:42 funding for a private grammar school
63:45 and one of our funders dropped out the
63:47 last minute we were 25 thousand dollars
63:49 short
63:50 so we went to
63:53 a potential funder a wealthy dentist and
63:55 said you know we would could you help us
63:58 out with this school
64:00 he said i know your name you have that
64:02 esp program right i said yeah
64:06 he said well tell you what i'm not going
64:07 to give you money
64:08 but i do sober futures
64:11 and
64:12 if your people can tell me what's
64:14 happening in silver futures i will bet
64:16 on what they say and you'll get 10 64:18 percent of what i make so if it works
64:21 you'll get money if it doesn't work you
64:23 don't get any money
64:25 well we were desperate
64:29 so i could really use the
64:32 trained remote viewers so i went to the
64:33 board of directors of the school and i
64:35 said you know we have this year-long
64:36 training program well i'm going to give
64:38 you a two-day training program and
64:40 you're all going to become remote
64:41 viewers overnight
64:44 now you might think that what i'm going
64:45 to do is say okay now that you can
64:47 remove you
64:48 tell me silver future's going up is it
64:50 going down
64:51 well that's the wrong question to ask
64:53 it's too analytical it depends what they
64:54 read the newspapers
64:57 but what remote viewers can do is
64:59 describe an object you put in their hand
65:02 the next day
65:03 to some degree
65:05 so for example in a given day i might
65:07 decide okay depending what the market
65:09 does tomorrow if it goes up i'll give
65:10 them an apple if it goes down i'll give
65:12 them a pencil
65:13 and then i just say of course they don't
65:15 tell them what the objects are i just
65:16 say i'm going to give you something
65:17 tomorrow depending what the market does
65:19 what does it look like
65:20 now this what i'm telling you now you
65:22 can actually go home and use so it
65:24 really works
65:25 and so if they say well i know it's
65:27 round and red like a ball i say well
65:29 that's
65:30 probably more like the apple
65:33 well i suppose it could be the eraser on
65:34 the end of the pencil
65:36 well it's probably more like the apple
65:38 so i'll bet on on that
65:41 and then they get the feedback the next
65:42 day and then we do it again with
65:44 different objects
65:46 to give an example
65:50 of course you pick objects that look as
65:51 different as they can possibly be this
65:54 is a wooden figurine
65:56 very aesthetic
65:57 here's a tape measure
66:01 depending where the market is going i'm
66:02 going to i'm going to show them one or
66:04 the other
66:05 as it turns out in this particular case
66:07 the tape measure was the object that
66:09 actually matched the market
66:13 one of the viewers says
66:16 i hear the words one two three said
66:19 rhythmically
66:20 there's something
66:22 all wound up
66:25 the other person says i don't know it
66:26 looks like a tin can it's got something
66:28 all squirreled up inside
66:30 so naturally i'm going to pick the
66:32 tape measure over the figurine
66:35 as it turns out in this case it's
66:37 it's good
66:38 by the way nice thing about this
66:39 technique which you call arv association
66:42 remote viewing
66:43 is that if some of the people give
66:45 responses that don't match either one
66:47 you can just throw those in the trash
66:48 and not worry about them
66:52 my favorite scientific graph
66:54 is money in the bank
66:58 we went into the market for 30 days
67:02 made
67:04 26 thousand dollars
67:07 of course the dentist made 260 thousand
67:09 dollars
67:12 so this actually has practical uh
67:15 outcomes i mean this this was uh this
67:17 was
67:18 also partly in response to
67:20 another skeptic
67:22 who said well if these people are so
67:23 psychic why aren't they rich why don't
67:25 they go to las vegas why don't they in
67:26 the stock market instead of that
67:29 you know which they actually they do do
67:30 but they don't advertise it so anyway
67:32 this this this was our proof that
67:34 you know it can happen it can work
67:37 so
67:39 where are
67:40 we in scientific community we have
67:43 people like astrophysicists who worry
67:45 about the stars we have biologists who
67:47 worry about the trees and the soil and
67:50 so on
67:51 but you know there's always going to be
67:52 some percentage of
67:54 renegade physicists like myself and my
67:56 colleagues who always want to
67:58 probe deeper look behind the scenes see
68:00 what's really going on explore new
68:02 territories
68:04 and that's how we ended up getting
68:06 involved in such a long and from my
68:08 standpoint very productive program
68:11 thank you very much
68:24 [Applause]
68:27 you

00:38 welcome to new realities my name is Alan
00:40 Steinfeld and on this program I like to
00:43 bring together the latest in scientific
00:45 spiritual quantum research tonight's
00:50 guest is someone who is an expert in all
00:52 these fields and he's developing now a
00:56 foundation for using zero-point energy
00:59 as inexhaustible means of replacing this
01:04 oil economy and giving the world the
01:07 energy it needs to to live in the 21st
01:11 century he's also one of the originators
01:13 of the remote viewing program that the
01:15 CIA used for psychic spying and that's a
01:19 whole field of study as well so his name
01:22 is dr. hal put off with these titular
01:24 pen studies in austin
01:25 so you're the developer of basically
01:27 these two divergent fields the remote
01:31 view instrument and then the zero-point
01:33 energy it is there anyway that these two
01:37 come together that's not clear from a
01:41 scientific standpoint whether they come
01:44 together but there's at least the
01:45 possibility that at least in the case of
01:48 say psychokinesis something like that
01:51 could be Co hearing of this so-called
01:55 vacuum zero-point energy but it's not up
01:58 to a place where we can certainly make a
02:01 connection
02:01 so zero-point energy basically is you
02:04 there's the vacuum or the void has
02:08 fluctuations within that that are are
02:11 energetic they're but they're vibrations
02:14 in the sense the void is not empty the
02:16 fact there is no such thing as a vacuum
02:18 that's right originally physicists
02:20 thought that empty space wasn't a truly
02:23 empty right but once quantum theory went
02:26 forward it was found that it's a result
02:28 of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
02:30 that there's always some jitter going on
02:32 that's unbeatable okay sorry so it turns
02:45 out that once quantum theory came along
02:48 it was recognized that this is an
02:50 inherent part of nature interesting and
02:53 at first the enormous energy that was
02:57 said to be an empty space seemed to be
02:59 so enormous that physicists thought well
03:02 maybe it's a mathematical artifact we
03:05 don't have corners very quite right but
03:07 then the experiment was done it was
03:10 noticed that the light that comes down
03:14 of say hydrogen atoms when they're
03:16 excited didn't the theory of it didn't
03:18 quite match the experimental data then
03:21 they saw they took them to account the
03:22 fact that these atoms aren't sitting in
03:24 an empty boy they're sitting in this or
03:26 a frothy bubbly former so-called
03:29 zero-point energy that that would
03:32 actually affect their orbits somewhat
03:33 and then they can match their any
03:35 experiments so the next step was well
03:37 okay this is real but it's not very
03:40 important it just minor Corrections to
03:42 atomic calculations or something but
03:45 then as time went on again realized it
03:48 played more and more of a central role
03:50 for example the fluorescent lights for
03:54 electric discharge in it excites the
03:56 atoms and then the atoms emit light
03:58 and and they met lightened by process
04:00 called spontaneous submission
04:02 spontaneous emission is sort of like the
04:05 equivalents sitting a pencil on its
04:07 point and then falls over in this case
04:11 the atom is an excited state that's sort
04:13 of like a pencil one's point and it
04:14 falls down emits its energy and the
04:18 first was just considered I mean
04:19 Einstein had coefficients for stimulated
04:22 emission as we have lasers and for
04:24 spontaneous emission and there was a
04:27 considered separate phenomenon we now
04:28 know though that spontaneous emission
04:30 isn't so spontaneous it's actually
04:32 brought about by the quantum
04:34 fluctuations so the very reason we have
04:36 stress of Lights actually depends on the
04:38 fact that empty space has this
04:40 underlying quantum energy well that idea
04:43 first came out and was pressed forward
04:45 in the eighties there was an immediate
04:48 test because it still was sort of
04:50 skeptically looked at okay well let's
04:52 make a cavity
04:53 we'll put atoms in it eliminate the
04:56 modes so there won't be any zero-point
04:57 energy in those modes and in that case
05:00 the excited atom should stay excited
05:02 right they built it and it worked they
05:05 were able to actually show that if you
05:06 reduce the vacuum fluctuations that the
05:11 key frequencies that no stimulate this
05:12 event to occur they actually don't occur
05:15 they don't occur so that you you narrow
05:18 the gap within these fluctuations I mean
05:20 there's actually some control over the
05:22 fluctuation and this is what you're
05:25 going for in your research to develop a
05:27 way of tapping into this energy exactly
05:30 the first person to recognize that
05:34 the possibility was Hendrick Kassner he
05:38 was a research director of those
05:39 laboratories and this energy is
05:42 electromagnetic in part and so just like
05:49 if you go into a shielded room and you
05:50 can't hear your cell phone or something
05:54 because the room is shielding similarly
06:02 if you could have a region of space that
06:06 you actually shield partially shielded
06:10 fluctuations and cause there to be a
06:13 deficit in between and it turns out that
06:15 when you do the calculations that
06:17 deficit results in the radiation
06:20 pressure associated with a deficit
06:22 trying to push the plates apart it's not
06:25 as strong as what's outside trying to
06:26 push the place together place come
06:27 together bang they hit they create heat
06:29 so there you have some slight conversion
06:32 of vacuum energy to heat so that was the
06:34 first sort of demonstration that it
06:36 could be tapped at least in principle it
06:38 proved to you that this is an impossible
06:40 unlimited source of energy that with the
06:43 right kind of details or materials that
06:48 you could somehow get to that's right
06:53 when you calculate how much energy is in
06:56 there in a region of space Fineman and
06:59 others have said well it's at least the
07:01 order of nuclear Energy's even in empty
07:05 space so it's a case of trying to find
07:08 out well how close are you to actually
07:12 get into this you know I mean like you
07:15 said like we talked about earlier Edison
07:17 he expended different elements or
07:21 materials before he got tungsten to
07:23 create the light bulb I mean in fact in
07:26 our proposals to our investors we
07:28 actually use the innocent story to point
07:30 out you know this may take a while there
07:34 are four or five techniques and
07:37 principle
07:38 whereby we see it might be doable but
07:42 we're still basically anyone working
07:44 this field is still looking for the
07:46 right engineering set up the right
07:49 construction to do it turns out that
07:51 this effect in general you get the most
07:54 energy at very small levels so may
07:57 require a lot of nano machining or
08:00 something and so unfortunately it's not
08:02 like a big fire they could just ignites
08:06 microscopic well you're confident that
08:08 it will happen that you will be able to
08:11 get what you're going for I'm confident
08:14 that eventually we will not confident
08:18 about is stating a specific time
08:20 specific timeline certainly help us
08:22 within my lifetime and I expected to be
08:24 within the lifetime
08:25 have you had remote viewers look and see
08:28 what this substance is or possibly you
08:30 know using some of these other areas to
08:32 kind of tune in because it's actually I
08:35 have it although some have volunteered
08:37 that they've looked on their own and
08:39 they sent me data but it's still not
08:44 you're looking for a material is that
08:46 what you're actually looking for
08:48 probably looking more it's gonna involve
08:50 materials it's also going to involve
08:52 geometrical shapes but also they
08:57 actually do involve the process I mean
08:59 just to give you an idea for example the
09:01 example I gave plates coming together
09:03 that's a very mechanical thing another
09:05 case is to make arc discharges sort of
09:08 microscopic ball lightning and there you
09:12 get a plasma that gets squeezed very
09:15 similar and in other cases you're
09:17 setting up bubbles in liquids with sound
09:21 waves and then the bubbles collapse and
09:24 there's a possibility that also
09:25 release syrup on energy Schwinger is a
09:29 Nobel Prize laureate wrote a number of
09:30 papers where he felt that that was could
09:33 be a mechanism that might show up in
09:35 some of the medicine so all these
09:36 different approaches are like while they
09:39 differ from each other you played
09:41 electrical discharges you've got bubbles
09:44 being created in liquid others we've
09:48 looked at involve gases so zero-point
09:51 energy back it's a medium that that
09:53 things can travel through right the
09:55 fluctuations are like let's say water
09:59 water sort of like looking at the
10:02 electrical or electromagnetic equivalent
10:04 of the froth at the base of a waterfall
10:06 Oh a lot of random motion
10:09 that's why generally we don't notice
10:12 it's there because it's all random and
10:14 therefore any effect in any given
10:16 direction is going to be cancelled out
10:17 by effect in an opposite direction
10:19 although there is one case do you notice
10:24 this energy is there and that's in
10:28 inertia so-called or if you're standing
10:30 on a train it takes off with a jerky and
10:33 to flatten your back you know what is it
10:35 that knocked you down it's actually ran
10:37 into this wall of Energy's very similar
10:38 to if you put your hand in a pool and
10:43 you go like that you'll feel the back
10:45 pressure in your hand
10:45 similarly if something tries to
10:47 accelerate you through this that can
10:49 fluctuate in energy the back pressure
10:52 that knocks you down in the case of the
10:53 trains is actually this so the
10:56 background fluctuations is holding mass
10:59 in place in the form of inertia is that
11:01 is that what help you hold it in place
11:03 unless you apply a force or as it turns
11:06 out
11:07 unlike throwing something through the
11:09 wind if you're just going at constant
11:11 velocity there's no resistance either
11:14 it's only when something tries to
11:15 accelerate you
11:17 then there's a resistance proportional
11:19 to acceleration that's why you have to
11:21 apply a force proportional acceleration
11:23 force equals mass times acceleration to
11:26 accelerate because you're trying to beat
11:29 against a resistance force which is
11:31 proportional right so yeah I think
11:33 pretty much but it's sort of like
11:36 there's this medium of that things
11:38 existent but it's not quite this
11:39 dimension of existence right because it
11:42 exists a kind of a void space I mean how
11:45 does it apply to non locality you know
11:47 where you know let's say a photon here
11:50 is affecting another quote so I'm there
11:52 and they say that instantaneously
11:54 happened is that has to do with this
11:55 this medium of the words there's a
11:59 connection and that is that this vacuum
12:02 fluctuation energy which I'm
12:04 concentrating in the electromagnetic
12:05 part actually there are other person
12:07 also have all wavelengths and
12:10 frequencies so that means that not only
12:13 is it wavelengths of few centimeters or
12:17 something but there are wavelengths that
12:19 are as big as the universe so in that
12:23 sense we are not just figured let's
12:25 believe or metaphorically we are
12:27 literally in touch across the universe
12:30 because our atoms are bathed in this sea
12:34 of energy that includes all these
12:36 wavelengths some of whose wavelengths
12:39 stretch out you know across the solar
12:41 system or whatever but the thing you
12:45 mentioned about this quantum correlation
12:47 and nonlocality
12:49 is possibly somewhat different we
12:53 haven't actually been able to pin down
12:56 the chauvinists epe chauvinist among us
13:00 think there isn't a direct connection
13:01 right but as far as the scientific
13:03 community goes as you
13:04 to be shown those are similar or
13:07 different phenomena that has to do with
13:09 the fact that there is a small school of
13:12 people who think that you might explain
13:15 much of quantum theory just by taking
13:18 into account the effects of the vacuum
13:20 fluctuations and that kentuc shoe a shoe
13:23 thereõs or put energy theory has been
13:25 used to derive a lot of results that you
13:28 would think you needed quantum theory
13:30 for but actually you can get it by this
13:31 path so the question is well can you get
13:33 everything in quantum theory by this
13:35 parent for example nonlocality yes yes
13:37 this is still a relatively new area
13:40 pushing into this area so we don't have
13:42 the answer and the whole space-time
13:43 thing where you talked about contracting
13:46 space in front of a ship and then having
13:48 it travel that warp speed that has to do
13:53 with this background but that's right
13:55 having changing the density as we say
13:59 changing the polarizability of the
14:01 background there's another so you're
14:03 accelerating through the vacuum when you
14:06 say you're accelerating within this
14:07 quantum fluctuation it has an effect on
14:09 that background field that that is
14:15 certainly the case because it's
14:16 essentially pushing aside the vacuum
14:19 fluctuation some degree and that's
14:20 what's causing their resistance we call
14:22 inertia but again for example in the
14:28 case of the Casimir plates was a simple
14:30 example you've got a depleted area of
14:33 zero-point energy here so you've
14:35 actually got forces it will push you in
14:39 that direction
14:39 down into this depleted regions but how
14:42 would you actually entrap space-time to
14:46 do that what what effect did you put out
14:49 there to have that well we know from
14:52 switching over the general relativity
14:54 side of it that if you look at the
14:56 equations whether you're using standard
15:00 general relativity or some of the other
15:02 approaches to general relativistic time
15:04 effects and very strong field strong
15:06 masses the mass of the earth affects the
15:11 space around it which thinking in terms
15:15 of zero-point energy is affecting the
15:17 distribution of zero-point energy so if
15:19 you go to that equation
15:20 F equals MA or the mass times the
15:23 acceleration equals the force if you
15:25 create a force you can generate a mass
15:30 that would have an effect on things you
15:32 might generate a force and the move of
15:33 mass start to accelerate it or what
15:37 you'd really like to do is just scoop
15:41 out the energy in front of us and the
15:43 energy behind it would just shoot us
15:45 forward so manipulating the density of
15:48 the vacuum polarizability of space-time
15:50 metric all those words relationship with
15:53 each other that would be the way to do
15:55 it and that's possible that's not just a
15:56 Star Trek concept but you've seen no we
16:00 know I mean small effects all of general
16:03 relativity for example is based on these
16:07 principles and we can calculate well gee
16:09 if only we had so much energy right and
16:12 then we can make this big effect like a
16:14 power of spaceship and so on it's just
16:16 that we don't have the engineering tools
16:18 to do it right now and frankly those of
16:23 us are working on I think there's still
16:24 something missing you know theory
16:26 because it's so hard to do we don't see
16:29 that it could ever really be done and
16:31 you
16:33 you know maybe there's some evidence
16:34 that there are spaceships out there that
16:37 don't belong to us what else well in
16:39 that case they must have gotten around
16:41 it so there may be some unexpected
16:45 factor that suddenly caused the
16:49 resonance to occur where with a lot less
16:51 energy you can get a big effect and that
16:53 usually happens in science that they
16:55 back into a solution instead of right
16:57 and usually it's even by accident in
17:00 fact and even though we think we're
17:02 smart enough that we should figure this
17:04 out we have something we call the
17:06 maverick inventor program and the idea
17:09 of our maverick inventor program is that
17:12 smart as we think we are and maybe some
17:14 guy in the garage is half crazy thumbs
17:17 across something
17:18 nobody'll pay any attention to him he
17:21 doesn't have good instruments because he
17:22 didn't have enough money to buy them so
17:24 his measurements are all messed up but
17:26 nonetheless you may actually stumble on
17:27 something so who's gonna pay attention
17:30 to him the academics aren't corporations
17:32 are so we have our mapping invented
17:34 program where we put out the word on the
17:36 internet and elsewhere saying you know
17:38 if you think you beat the system if you
17:40 think you come up with a novel energy
17:43 source or pulsing source bring it to our
17:46 laboratory will investigate it so we've
17:48 investigated many things brought to us
17:50 they all go up on the website so great
17:52 great gory detail you can see well you
17:55 know and I thought you could use this if
17:56 you what is that somehow inert gas
17:59 represents a kind of boundary to this
18:02 dimensional space and you know like
18:04 electronic with the electrons filling up
18:07 certain shells so there might be some
18:11 kind of way to get beyond that boundary
18:14 that inert gases represent in order to
18:16 access somebody in between places in the
18:20 quantum fluctuations does that make
18:21 sense well it turns out that some of our
18:24 best experiments that actually have
18:26 shown what we call over Union unity
18:31 energy generation we have involved
18:34 striking spark discharges in noble gases
18:39 and as a result we've actually seen some
18:44 evidence for energy generation or energy
18:46 conversion that was a good news the bad
18:48 news is was that it was at the Nana watt
18:51 and the devices were immediately
18:55 corroded and didn't last and then all
18:57 attempts to scale up those particular
19:00 devices turned out that the loss of
19:02 scaled up faster than the good effect so
19:04 even though we have something like seven
19:06 pans been current have been patented and
19:10 the Patent Office bought off our claim
19:15 which was these were devices to convert
19:18 vacuum fluctuation energy into some
19:20 other form and then the last week we
19:22 haven't actually come up with the right
19:24 connection yet right well
19:26 philosophically speaking if we can just
19:28 a little bit into that if let's say we
19:32 do come up with this source that we tap
19:35 the boy the free energy that's out there
19:38 doesn't that change the whole social
19:40 psychology of your society that says yes
19:43 there is a free lunch
19:44 I mean willing to have a you know you'd
19:46 ramification I mean psychologically I
19:49 don't have actually a lot of
19:52 ramification sociologically
19:53 psychologically for example from the
19:57 geopolitical standpoint when you have an
20:00 oil economy and you're tied to the
20:02 geopolitical sources right this energy
20:06 which is everywhere is ten cents more
20:09 democratic right doesn't matter
20:11 principles happen it also could in the
20:15 long run as people really have soaked
20:19 into their philosophies affect things
20:22 and no way I've thought of and that is
20:24 our entire physics structure is
20:29 hierarchical we have the Sun it provides
20:31 energy to the earth
20:33 it grows the plans you know we obviously
20:36 have a hierarchy of where we as beings
20:39 and individuals get our energy from
20:40 right on the other hand this is not a
20:44 hierarchical process it's a broad scale
20:48 process and so it's like really a
20:51 convergent from a hierarchical attitude
20:54 toward a whatever you would call because
21:03 there's and science always thought
21:06 nature as a lie isn't the basis of
21:09 science is to kind of you know make our
21:12 life here more comfortable in today yes
21:15 but it goes through phases where nature
21:19 is an enemy to be conquered and variety
21:22 and then while nature is something to be
21:25 accommodated to and interacted with and
21:29 generally speaking while we see it going
21:32 in both ways obviously we have
21:35 appliances that make drudgery in life
21:38 easier and then we have hydrogen bombs
21:41 right so like five you know exactly so
21:45 similarly I had look on zero-point
21:47 energy as being like those they're a
21:49 tool but in the end it's what people do
21:52 is it that counts and and unfortunately
21:55 it would appear that our sociological
22:00 ethical levels are barely if if at all
22:04 keeping up with our technological
22:06 prowess
22:07 maybe that's what consciousness itself
22:09 is waiting for to have this invention I
22:13 have enough of you challenge that's okay
22:15 we don't really have to get our act
22:16 together
22:17 right I mean was Tesla on to anything
22:20 because he you know the stories that
22:22 said you could stick one of his
22:24 lightning rods in the ground and get
22:25 energy is there any truth to the Tesla
22:27 devices certainly Tesla was a genius
22:30 yeah no doubt about that and it's still
22:33 hard for electrical engineers to go
22:35 through school to really get their mind
22:37 around how some of his complex AC
22:40 machinery operated I mean he's a genius
22:44 and he also had a strong intuitive
22:47 feeling this was before quantum theory
22:50 he made the statement which I can't
22:53 quite remember the exact quote but he
22:55 said he felt that space was full of
22:57 energy if it was static wouldn't do us
22:59 any good but if it was dynamic we would
23:02 yoke man's inventions to the wheel work
23:05 of nature or something like that and of
23:07 course now that we you know zero-point
23:10 energy vacuum fluctuation energy is
23:12 dynamic it does fill all of space you
23:15 look back and say well his intuition was
23:17 right although I didn't have the details
23:19 down and as far as the stories of the
23:22 various devices he made some of them
23:25 like his attempt to generate energy with
23:32 his antennas and then propagate around
23:34 the world it makes some sense but it's
23:38 not clear that really wouldn't work
23:40 we thought there's some more urban myth
23:43 kinds of things and while he built one
23:45 of these 300 generators and ran a car
23:48 but no one's been able to really pin
23:50 down that's not in his patents
23:52 known as really is basically anecdotal
23:54 stories so it's hard to know just how
23:57 far I mean you're looking at a genius he
24:00 comes up with things you don't come up
24:02 with a lot more and then you said well
24:04 since these are true should I believe
24:06 those and it's just hard to evaluate
24:08 until we can cover the same track but
24:11 there are a lot of people interested in
24:12 testimony well if anything could be true
24:13 Newton we know after developing as more
24:16 as a thermodynamic study alchemy for the
24:18 rest of his life and maybe he was onto
24:20 something maybe he was right crazy but
24:23 you know in reading some of the material
24:24 is something called the cosmological
24:25 constant where the relationship of the
24:29 electron is somehow related to the size
24:32 of the universe yes and some of the
24:35 zero-point energy modeling that I and my
24:36 colleagues studied and we did come up
24:41 with some ways of relating the size of
24:44 the universe to quote the classical size
24:47 of electrons so and that relationship
24:50 comes out of zero-point energy modeling
24:52 so we're pursuing things like that right
24:55 and that in that sense zero-point energy
24:57 modeling the intense level we're pushing
25:01 it it's like trying to get a step deeper
25:04 than the usual equations and usual
25:07 effects so someone still needs to mature
25:10 before we're sure under something we
25:13 could the universe itself be an electron
25:15 and some greater vaster of Babbo
25:18 what has been talked about the fact that
25:20 the universe
25:21 you look at the numbers associated that
25:23 they could itself be a black hole we
25:25 where they in a black hole yeah who
25:27 knows how many others are out there
25:29 actually this idea that you just
25:31 mentioned about well couldn't we be like
25:33 the small component and they're much
25:35 larger there are a lot of serious
25:39 theoretical work going on now by
25:42 cosmologists about the possibility that
25:44 our whole universe is just one of many
25:47 yeah Linda Sanford is Russian and who's
25:51 now there at Sanford is one of the most
25:55 respected cosmologists he's the opinion
25:58 that well this universe got spawn
26:01 there's no reason why another one
26:03 couldn't today is no better than
26:05 yesterday so maybe is like a fractal
26:07 tree and University being spawned all
26:09 over the place on a continuing basis
26:12 we've just happened not to be connecting
26:14 up with them but then even that theories
26:17 grown a step further where now people
26:18 are talking about him and maybe
26:20 sometimes these universes run into each
26:22 other and then you have a big release of
26:24 energy
26:24 maybe that's behind some of these many
26:27 big bangs quasars or whatever so these
26:31 days cosmology and astrophysics is
26:34 outstripping science fiction so fast you
26:36 can hardly keep up with and the theories
26:37 are proliferating and in the old days if
26:40 you had a wild theory might be Sean but
26:43 these days the data is coming in so fast
26:45 and we have so many inexplicable
26:48 phenomena going on basically it's okay
26:51 in physics now to have really wild
26:54 theories that you want to try to check
26:56 against today
26:57 well then what's one of your favorite
26:58 inexplicable theories really where the
27:03 energy from quasars comes from our
27:06 gamma-ray burster z-- their longest
27:09 amounts of energy
27:10 there was a gamma-ray burst or just a
27:14 few years ago that basically as far as
27:16 we could tell released more energy
27:19 second only to the Big Bang's
27:22 so accounting for that it's difficult
27:26 and there are actually a number of
27:28 papers have been published on the idea
27:30 that maybe it was in fact there are
27:34 papers called Casimir collapse of
27:36 supernovae indicating that maybe some
27:40 vacuum energy is being released in some
27:41 of these phenomena obviously more that
27:43 we don't know that we do know it's open
27:45 later I mean now it's really getting
27:47 down to the embarrassing point where we
27:49 recognize that four percent of the
27:54 universe we can account for and the
27:56 other ninety six percent is in dark
27:58 matter and dark energy and we don't know
28:00 what any of them are right there's all
28:02 the string theory and integer venture
28:04 and multi-dimensional so I mean there
28:08 could be something behind the zero point
28:10 vacuum energy I mean what it seems like
28:13 in some of the other literature it may
28:15 be some of the metaphysical literature's
28:16 there's a grid that then gets some
28:18 coherent that lines up the the quantum
28:23 fluctuations you have any evidence of
28:25 some kind of other-dimensional type grid
28:28 that's behind the fluctuations in my
28:32 case I haven't done a particular
28:36 calculation and published it actually in
28:40 Physical Review a where I took a
28:43 different tack and that is you've got
28:45 all these charged particles all these
28:47 atoms electrons and so on they're all
28:49 jiggling around
28:50 zero-point energy C and radiating away
28:53 and then in the given atom is caught in
28:56 the radiation pattern of all the other
28:57 jiggling particles so I did a
28:59 cosmological calculation and found that
29:02 it appeared to be electromagnetic
29:05 equivalent of putting a speaker by a
29:07 microphone and getting the squeal
29:09 particles are all radiating because in
29:12 the other particles a jiggle and then
29:14 they're jiggling as a feedback mechanism
29:15 cause them to radiate because the first
29:17 product and so this thing is like a
29:19 self-perpetuating mechanism and it turns
29:24 out that the frequency distribution is
29:26 your point energy is goes is the
29:29 frequency cube frequency is a third
29:31 power so there's more and more energy in
29:33 the higher and higher frequencies and
29:35 this particular calculation predicted
29:37 that QE frequency distribution so in my
29:39 modeling I don't need an extra any extra
29:42 dimension but I know there are other
29:43 people who consider the maybe zero-point
29:46 energy is something pouring in from
29:49 another dimension as happens not to be
29:51 back on tape well there's something
29:53 behind it there's another another more
29:55 subtle layer let's say there is this you
29:57 know fun that exists and then something
30:01 is generating it well yeah actually this
30:05 is an area that I and my colleagues at
30:07 the Institute for Advanced Studies are
30:08 looking at right now because even when
30:10 you say okay I've got zero-point energy
30:12 say well what exactly is that well it's
30:15 electromagnetic what do you mean some
30:16 electromagnetic well it's got electric
30:18 fields and then it feels waves okay well
30:22 what is electric field a wave in what
30:24 and so in some sense unless you just
30:28 want to draw the line and say no it's
30:30 mathematically worse and I can't worry
30:31 about it there are still the questions
30:33 well obviously there's something even
30:35 deeper than that because we're not
30:38 describing what this room
30:40 energy electromagnetic waves are waves
30:42 of what exactly what what so they get
30:45 into is this whole idea of consciousness
30:47 you know where you're saying that you
30:48 can't really show or you've been able to
30:51 shield some of these zero-point energy
30:53 do but you couldn't shield it from a
30:55 remote viewer you know so like
30:57 consciousness somehow is traveling in
31:01 some medium or a part of some non-local
31:04 aspect that's even beyond these
31:06 fluctuations but certainly has got to be
31:10 the case and these fluctuations are
31:12 handled by normal physics may appear in
31:15 the textbooks and so on but no one has a
31:17 model for how something like Ramon can
31:20 really work so obviously there's a lot
31:23 more going on right but there's probably
31:26 is a science or there's some may be more
31:29 subtle medium in which consciousness
31:31 thing can travel or you'd be reasonable
31:34 I mean certainly as a physicist I assume
31:36 if it walks it's physics so if it
31:39 travels even spiritually it's physics
31:42 but you know it's interesting that it
31:46 used to be ages ago
31:48 religion was the big thing right and
31:50 then a certain point in our development
31:52 we carved out a piece of religion called
31:55 it philosophy and then we carved out a
31:59 piece of philosophy and call it natural
32:00 science and in that transition I've
32:04 always marveled at the fact that was
32:06 alchemy in became chemistry what was
32:10 astrology became astronomy what was
32:13 metaphysics became physics and science
32:17 gets to go to my psychology friends what
32:19 was demonology became psychology and
32:22 that process was a process whereby we're
32:26 trying to get rid of subjective element
32:28 to make it totally objective
32:29 unfortunately in that process we
32:32 somewhat threw out some of the baby with
32:34 the bathwater but I think it was a
32:37 necessary step to go through to get this
32:40 but now that science has gotten its legs
32:44 and somewhat strong it's beginning to
32:47 reincorporate so for example we had a
32:49 stralla ji saying you know things depend
32:52 on the stars I don't know chemistry
32:54 there's no subjective factors but now
32:56 it's been recognized pretty much by
32:59 scientists or open-minded that there is
33:00 a so-called Mars effect that is people
33:03 born under the sign of Mars happen to be
33:06 you know fill up the books for athletes
33:10 similarly numerology attend became
33:13 mathematics so the magic of numbers kind
33:15 of went away but now that we have
33:18 Mathematica being realized that
33:19 principles like supersymmetry are kind
33:21 of saying there is a magical aspect of
33:24 mathematics assembly go from alchemy to
33:28 chemistry but even quantum theory says
33:31 the observer you know is maybe the
33:34 center that effects everything around it
33:36 so I mean just by having the observer
33:39 effect something means that you know
33:42 consciousness is sort of a center point
33:44 of the universe each individual
33:47 consciousness let's say is the center of
33:48 a totality I mean that's how I see you
33:51 know certainly and some physicists have
33:53 really pressed that point oh ma Eugene
33:56 Wigner was especially press that point
34:01 that really as long as we're leaving
34:04 consciousness out we're making a mistake
34:06 it consciousness is somehow involved in
34:08 the observation process and certainly
34:10 and from a physics standpoint
34:13 any measurement which yields information
34:17 to an individual obviously somewhere
34:19 along the line had consciousness
34:21 involved so it's a case of all just how
34:24 much wasn't involved in John Wheeler is
34:26 one of the icons of physics has made a
34:31 big issue but it's a participatory
34:35 universes his phrase rather than just oh
34:39 just a Temari then we have an effect of
34:42 the quantum fluctuations I mean was it
34:45 your initial going into the remote
34:48 viewing a field based on of quantum
34:52 understanding the story about that right
34:56 I was interested in whether quantum
34:59 physics could be extended to account for
35:02 living processes and at that time there
35:09 were some ideas kind of floating around
35:10 so this is what sort of got me started
35:12 looking at consciousness issues and
35:16 doing that experiment that ended up
35:18 showing up on my doorstep but you also
35:21 told the great story about how you
35:23 started to investigate levitation well
35:26 that was later later on when we were
35:30 looking at the literature about
35:32 so-called psychokinesis and in fact we
35:37 weren't getting any in the lab really
35:38 but we we did get some magnetometer
35:42 experiments with mental projection yeah
35:45 we're basically someone's not there and
35:47 we had sensitive
35:53 magnetometer radiometer actually and on
35:57 a random schedule that was spit out by a
36:00 random number generator the person had
36:01 to make something happen
36:03 or not you got statistically significant
36:06 evidence but they're all a really small
36:08 scale effect so that's when I did think
36:11 of you know we have a literature where
36:14 people are claiming it you know
36:15 levitating Saints or whatever so I
36:18 decided to look in the literature I
36:19 wanted to see the descriptions of these
36:22 phenomena see there's some physics that
36:24 we can learn and I must admit I started
36:27 out skeptically as well as probably
36:29 maybe the church and bragging about
36:31 their magical people or whatever when
36:33 you actually go into the records it
36:35 turns out Weston that way at all it
36:37 turned out that somebody out in the
36:40 boondocks was levitating it might be a
36:41 very profane person and so in fact at
36:45 the time the church went out to debunk
36:47 it well there's a person who apparently
36:50 floating so you can't say it's not
36:51 happening so the next line of defense
36:54 was to take very careful notes to show
36:58 that there are certain subtleties and
36:59 nuances that Memphis was diabolically
37:01 inspired not God inspired and in those
37:06 notes the physicist recognizes
37:09 description of general relativistic kind
37:11 of phenomena like what like for example
37:14 the person might rise vertically and
37:16 then swing horizontally by the model of
37:19 the day which is some invisible demon to
37:21 pick the person up you still expect the
37:23 hair to hang down
37:24 and in fact the hair would hang down
37:27 parallel to the body and the dress would
37:29 hang down parallel the body as if they
37:31 were in a space warp somebody else got
37:33 too close they could get caught up in it
37:36 another aspect was so we got too close
37:39 to their feel they could get all that's
37:42 in the literature that's language as
37:44 well and you wouldn't expect that we'd
37:45 expect that especially by the priests
37:48 and so but they're there other more
37:52 subtle things for example as described
37:54 with people's faces would glow like
37:57 molten metal they say well you know
37:59 that's strange and that turns out that
38:03 you know we've probably heard the term
38:04 redshift heavy gravitational stars and
38:08 so on the light comes it's redshifted
38:11 well in an antigravity condition or a
38:14 levitation condition it would go the
38:16 other way you get a blue shift so you
38:18 could easily imagine that okay if
38:20 somebody's in a levitated state then the
38:24 heat spectrum that you don't ordinarily
38:25 see might blue shift up in the lower
38:28 part of the visible spectrum and you
38:30 would look like you were going and so
38:32 there are little subtleties like that
38:33 and I look at a woman they didn't know
38:35 about general relativity so they didn't
38:36 know how to make this now right so what
38:38 do you think they were doing to get to
38:40 those states and what material well this
38:43 the only thing I could imagine is that
38:46 they were affecting the space-time
38:48 continuum and that probably means you
38:52 know where is the energy to do that with
38:54 the vacuum fluctuation energies there so
38:56 they must have he must be Co hearing the
38:58 macro function
38:59 energy and so actually is because of
39:02 that that I started looking at a vacuum
39:05 fluctuation model for gravity and and
39:08 then eventually inertia and so some of
39:10 that was actually inspired by saying
39:13 okay well they must have cohered the
39:15 vacuum fluctuation energy so it must be
39:17 that gravity is somehow a redistribution
39:19 of vacuum fluctuation energy and then I
39:22 found out that in fact Sakharov famous
39:25 freshman physicists dissident and so on
39:30 was actually the first to come up with
39:32 the idea that okay we've got general
39:35 relativity we've got an Einstein's
39:36 equations that's all fine but where did
39:39 these equations come from they just say
39:40 if you have mass here energy here space
39:43 gets worked here there's this is just a
39:45 mathematical equivalence where does it
39:46 come from what's it do - so he took a
39:49 level deeper and he came to conclusion
39:51 that it was in fact a redistribution of
39:54 vacuum energy so if someone has the
39:58 ability to mental we go here the vacuum
40:02 fluctuations then they could levitate I
40:05 would think that that would be the case
40:08 did you know I keep waiting for somebody
40:10 to show up he can do that because I have
40:11 a whole list of experiment well can egos
40:13 want a Mesa Ingo Swann affected the
40:16 Clark receptive hard to pin down exactly
40:20 what mechanism was going on it was he
40:24 was affecting a very sensitive magnetic
40:29 device I need something to test out the
40:34 zero-point energy theory
40:36 more robust you need some but K have you
40:40 been able to measure a me said you
40:42 couldn't people could move these
40:43 magnetometers but has there any been any
40:45 measurements of the psychic kinetic
40:48 energy coming off of people yeah not
40:52 really I mean people have claimed to
40:54 make some measurements sometimes I know
40:58 in another laboratory where people would
41:01 claim to psycho kinetically cause a
41:05 magnet needle to rotate then they would
41:09 leave and it was found that if you put a
41:13 new compass in there it would rotate so
41:16 the structure of the space was somehow
41:20 restructure to some degree and it only
41:23 faded over hours now I'd like to get in
41:26 there if we had really good devices for
41:28 measuring is your point energy and had
41:30 long enough time it'd be possible to
41:33 make those measurements very no no one
41:35 is doing but this whole idea of
41:37 consciousness that somehow is beyond the
41:40 zero-point energy field and also maybe
41:42 beyond space and time like you've done
41:44 to some of the remote viewing
41:45 experiments sort of implies that you
41:48 know we have some key within us to
41:52 controlling reality and and the
41:55 fluctuation certainly what we saw in the
41:57 remote viewing was people who do things
41:58 that as physicists we couldn't explain
42:01 especially in the future the viewing
42:05 viewing of future events I mean that
42:08 really wipes out most theoretical
42:10 modeling evie even models that involve
42:15 the possibility of forward and backward
42:18 propagation of light ways still can't
42:21 handle somebody describing an event
42:24 takes place in a week or something how
42:27 would you let's say you hypothesize how
42:29 would you in physics terms or maybe some
42:32 far-out physics explained it means well
42:36 one depressing way to explain is that
42:38 it's all cast in concrete from here to
42:41 infinity or whatever and we're just
42:44 marching through the slideshow frame by
42:47 frame and everything there is no such
42:50 thing as pretty well it's all cast and
42:54 so somehow somebody find some tricky way
42:58 to jump ahead a few frames and say
43:00 what's happening that might imply that
43:02 you know we don't have free will so
43:05 that's actually an get into fist
43:08 sophisticated arguments where you can
43:09 actually make all those things kind of
43:11 work out but well what about the yeah
43:14 but they weren't always right about
43:16 pretty you know forecasting the future
43:18 so like yeah about parallel universes or
43:21 or each moment there's a split in the
43:24 possible futures that can happen from
43:28 this moment on depends which path we
43:30 take is in fact to show how sci-fi
43:33 physics has become there is a serious
43:36 theory and by serious I mean it's
43:38 published and no one can hit balls in it
43:42 called the multi worlds interpretation
43:45 the many-worlds interpretation of
43:47 quantum theory which says that at every
43:50 instant of all the quantum possibilities
43:53 everything that could happen does happen
43:54 and so there's a you that just said this
43:58 to me yeah but at some quantum level
44:01 there was you that decided not to say
44:02 that to say something else and he's
44:04 going off and right and so but it's so
44:07 seemingly absurd from the usual
44:10 viewpoint they don't think any physicist
44:12 really believes that all possibilities
44:16 fact unwinding in the future but they've
44:19 been able to mathematically prove that
44:21 that's possible well they've been able
44:22 to mathematically prove that if you have
44:24 that physics set up with that
44:27 understanding it doesn't violate
44:29 anything we observe because it just
44:31 turns out we're following one of the
44:33 tracks so it's like a theory you can't
44:36 disprove right I don't think anybody no
44:39 no it's out of a way of proving it and
44:41 unless you actually get access to
44:43 alternate realities but I have to say no
44:47 physicist really buys it but it's in the
44:50 book says my name everyone lists various
44:53 approaches to quantum theory that gets
44:56 listed because it can't be disproved
44:58 well so you then you're thinking though
45:01 have been through many levels of
45:03 openness right and we came to remote
45:06 viewing very you know thinking that it
45:08 wasn't possible and you expanded it not
45:10 only did I come to remote viewing
45:11 thinking it wasn't impossible 13 years
45:15 in the program every time I went in to
45:17 do a session with remote viewer I would
45:20 ask myself how can I be doing is why am
45:23 I here this can't possibly work I have
45:26 all the same resistances bubbling up and
45:30 then there'd be some spectacular results
45:32 and face it so I mean we do have to
45:37 reevaluate our whole understanding of
45:39 consciousness physics and I bet you
45:41 yourself even Remote View right I mean
45:44 you were also actually one of the
45:49 conditions of the program of the
45:51 government funding actually from people
45:54 at CIA who started the program was we
45:58 learned from the LSD days the
46:00 experimenters should not get involved in
46:01 their experiments so we will let you
46:03 have this from
46:04 program one condition and that is you
46:06 never never never yourself promote do so
46:09 you know looking forward to polygraphs
46:12 and so on yeah we didn't but now they
46:16 ratted the program have you tried
46:18 occasionally for fun yeah but there is
46:21 something too I mean you gotta try then
46:23 you do get images lugging into your mind
46:26 and it's coming from somewhere yeah well
46:29 I mean certainly as we saw even when
46:31 you've got a remote viewer you've got an
46:34 interviewer and you have some target you
46:39 don't know what it is and the person
46:41 comes up with something that he knows
46:42 just can't be right the interviewer is
46:45 sitting there really disgusted he knows
46:48 what the person is saying can be right
46:50 they both try to get rid of the same age
46:53 and start from scratch
46:54 still keeps coming in so finally give up
46:57 and put it down and it turns out to be
46:59 correct so obviously the information is
47:02 there and has a certain robustness that
47:05 you can't just discount so taking it all
47:09 together you know the quantum
47:11 fluctuations of remote viewing I mean
47:14 there probably will be a place where
47:15 they converge in since that
47:18 consciousness is somehow a key element
47:20 in all these phenomena yeah as I say as
47:26 a physic chauvinist okay I've got
47:28 physics I know I've got some advanced
47:31 physics that we're pushing I got this
47:33 island of remote viewing this island of
47:37 consciousness I know they all go
47:40 together because they're all pieces
47:42 they're all pieces of the universe yeah
47:45 and really if we had truly the physics
47:48 of the universe
47:49 everything would be in there so the fact
47:51 that everything isn't in there we know
47:54 we had a lot of a lot of work to do but
47:55 I make myself feel better by realizing
47:59 that there's going to be a 26th century
48:01 physics 32 second century physics and
48:05 whatever that physics is they're gonna
48:06 look back at 21st century physics to say
48:09 oh how could they believe that stuff is
48:11 so limited it's so primitive so clearly
48:15 as time goes on we're gonna we're
48:19 already getting little snippets of
48:21 connections between these things but we
48:22 really have a lot of work to do I don't
48:24 have to say nothing makes you more
48:27 humble than being a physicist facing the
48:30 realities and you realize you can't
48:31 stitch them all together yeah but you
48:33 have an open mind which is the best
48:36 thing about you and if you have an open
48:37 mind
48:42 no but I mean you your work is
48:45 connecting these dots yeah that seems to
48:48 be my destiny in life on the physics
48:51 stuff I'm on the edge of it obviously
48:53 the remote viewing we're on the edge of
48:55 consciousness things and some people
48:59 just sort of have a makeup that if it
49:01 isn't about on the edge it's boring and
49:04 so I haven't be one of those people but
49:06 there are more and more these days well
49:08 it's great it means we're in a more open
49:10 society with more breakthrough that's
49:11 right and also even just one thing that
49:14 does feed it is our technological
49:16 prowess and our technological progress
49:20 are opening up things faster than we
49:23 even count for them if something comes
49:24 down the pipe one day at a time you can
49:28 kind of incorporate it okay that's fine
49:30 but now stuff with our super telescopes
49:33 or whatever
49:36 let us look at back in time edge of the
49:39 universe that we can see and the
49:41 microscopes are looking at quantum
49:43 phenomena where we get we now make
49:45 lasers out of single atoms wow I mean
49:48 stuff just goes on and on and so the
49:50 stuff is coming in such a firehose that
49:52 any physicist realizes that you know
49:54 he's not able to integrate all this
49:56 stuff you know we really have a long way
49:59 to go there's a lot of data in our and
50:01 data overload to try to that's the
50:06 exciting times we live in and so on
50:08 thank you for all your hard work why I
50:12 actually get paid to do this in living
50:14 songs I'm really a lucky guy me to be
50:21 it'll be for the little the day you say
50:25 yes we got the answer to how to tap into
50:27 the zero-point energy field yeah
50:30 recently I was a DoD panel January of
50:35 this year where we were tasked with
50:38 looking at how do we accelerate movement
50:42 from fossil fuel economy to a hydrogen
50:45 economy and so I got to spend one
50:49 afternoon presenting what we call the
50:51 wild card scenario - suppose tomorrow we
50:54 suddenly discovered zero-point energy as
50:57 as a source so we had to sort of wargame
51:00 you know well how would we handle this
51:02 you know what would we do how would we
51:04 announce it who would be in charge you
51:06 know would this be primarily government
51:08 very corporate driven I mean these are
51:10 really complicated issues and they had
51:15 a magnificent computer integration
51:17 system or all these ideas and went into
51:20 this elaborate expert system and it was
51:24 trying to you know come up with an
51:26 optimum path whatever you deal with this
51:33 could be Nobel Prize material like me
51:36 but as a humanist you also have a
51:39 perspective on just the kind of
51:42 immediate situation how it affects
51:44 people in their everyday lives you know
51:46 it would be I mean it would probably do
51:51 something to religion I would think
51:53 right and the belief system and you know
51:56 a god or oriental Jean was heavy heavy
51:59 belief systems so certainly defined that
52:04 we're all interconnected were all part
52:09 of a fabric of space time energy and
52:14 it'd be harder and harder for an
52:16 individual to maintain that he was an
52:18 isolated unit and so the more and more
52:22 we find that we are connected into the
52:24 cosmos as a whole I mean finally in my
52:31 way of thinking and trying to come down
52:32 we would end up finally with a unified
52:35 view in which energy and information and
52:39 process and dynamics were all integrated
52:43 also it would affect all of our
52:45 philosophical of those religious views
52:47 and our economic if do you have a
52:52 question Jim one question
52:57 string Theory's I bring that up because
53:01 unlike that you're summing 11 Direction
53:04 dimensions based on a mathematical
53:07 concert do you feel that's a rational
53:11 way to go or said artificial should we
53:14 be searching for our live inventions yes
53:17 so how can we deal with it well string
53:20 theory is an interesting challenge and
53:22 it has made the headway it's made
53:25 because the mathematics that have been
53:29 developed to look at well what would it
53:31 be like if we had an 11 dimensional
53:34 universe or whatever have predicted some
53:37 unifying aspects of electromagnetism and
53:39 gravity and so on and even accounting
53:42 for the particle structures and so on so
53:44 on the one hand is a mathematical tool
53:47 it keeps kind of spitting out some
53:50 things that we know are true and hadn't
53:53 really thought about it account for
53:55 before so it's like you can't exactly
53:57 say well I'm just not gonna bother
53:59 thinking about that on the other hand
54:01 it's also one of the disasters a
54:06 strengths area it doesn't look like
54:08 there's any way to actually do an
54:11 experiment to prove whether strings the
54:14 string theory way and 11 54:16 there's a way to go anytime soon and so
54:19 that means you can really run amok with
54:23 mathematics and you know maybe not get
54:27 anywhere and but it wouldn't be probably
54:29 to tell if you were getting somewhere
54:31 whereas most Theory you can sort of go
54:33 out and test it to see on the other hand
54:37 there are certain implications of it
54:39 that say well there's some experiments
54:42 that will maybe we could accomplish
54:46 something in the lab so one specific
54:48 prediction of some of these
54:50 multi-dimensional theories is that
54:52 Newton's inverse square law you think
54:56 about whatever where does an inverse
54:58 square law come from it comes from the
55:00 fact that you got a sphere here and you
55:03 imagine lines of energy or gravitational
55:07 field coming out as you go to bigger and
55:09 bigger and bigger sphere x' the area
55:12 grows is the square of the radius and
55:17 therefore the density of lines coming
55:20 out through is going to drop as a square
55:22 and you say okay but suppose I had not
55:26 this two-dimensional sphere suppose I
55:27 had a 3-dimensional sphere and I'm
55:30 spending in a four dimensional space or
55:31 whatever well then turns out you
55:33 wouldn't get an inverse-square law you
55:35 get something else a cube law so people
55:40 are doing actually going to the trouble
55:42 to do experiments in laboratories say
55:44 okay well let's measure Newton's law at
55:49 micron distances a millimeter distance
55:52 is micron distances and if in fact these
55:55 other dimensions are there when we get
55:57 down
55:57 they're not too far away or maybe
56:00 they're kind of big we could actually
56:03 see an experimental result where we had
56:06 a deviation from the inverse square law
56:08 and very tiny distances so people are
56:11 doing that at those experiments they've
56:12 gotten down I know they've gotten down
56:13 to millimeters and also they've gotten
56:15 down to tenths or hundredths of a
56:17 millimeter yet so those areas where we
56:21 say okay maybe we're right on the edge
56:23 that we could determine where there's
56:24 some extra dimensions here people are
56:26 doing experiments so it's - ready to say
56:29 about strain theory certainly some of
56:32 the most elegant mathematics you know
56:38 Brian Greene whatever
56:41 it's gorgeous stuff from a mathematical
56:43 standpoint and so the only thing we has
56:46 okay it's great aesthetics
56:48 mathematically but is it real well one
56:51 of the promises was I thought that you
56:54 would be able to predict the size of the
57:04 means in general means of calculating in
57:14 the well this is the point where all
57:17 theories are your foundering - we have
57:22 these particle electrons a certain size
57:24 spec amount of charge or here's a proton
57:26 - here's some quarks they've got some
57:29 different charges and masses and say
57:31 okay you're so smart to get a theory
57:33 that Bentley why don't you predict all
57:36 these we can't predict a single one we
57:39 don't have
57:39 that yet necessarily looks like it's
57:42 going to be successful in predicting it
57:44 and now they're in the quantum theory
57:46 the jiggling around anyway you begin to
57:49 worry whether it's even possible in
57:50 principle we could ever prepare
57:51 something very accurately so well
57:53 whether there's any merit at all but
57:55 just charge right I mean isn't there
57:57 that whole theory this in fact my
58:00 colleague at Institute for Advanced
58:03 Studies Michael Emerson is specifically
58:05 working on a model of massless charge
58:08 right where it's just charge and fields
58:11 right and then a mass mass the pharisee
58:15 of mass comes out at a higher level is
58:17 just a consequence of the fact that mass
58:22 does not exist as fundamental thing but
58:24 only as kind of a byproduct again to the
58:27 hindu thing that this is all illusion
58:28 and you know what they say this is just
58:31 should forces anyway leaving some of the
58:35 so-called ether
58:36 physicists of the 1800s had come to the
58:39 conclusion that there is only one thing
58:41 sort of like water in the bathtub
58:43 you've got waves that go back and forth
58:46 vortex is go down the drain but it's all
58:50 made of water right and there's nothing
58:52 other than water so is that true is in
58:56 your you know what research is that
58:59 possible it's all just being made of one
59:02 thing yeah I wouldn't reject it and I
59:05 tend to have sort of subject the leaning
59:10 in that direction but whether it's sure
59:12 or not I don't know we have to get to
59:14 that
59:21 because the flow time can go in any
59:23 direction until they come back
59:26 protons are very complex because when
59:29 you think about a photon going through
59:31 space it's got electric fields it's got
59:34 magnetic fields it's got spin so right
59:37 away even something as simple as a
59:39 photon turns out to be complex enough
59:43 that you try to figure out well why is
59:45 it circularly polarized or why is this
59:49 or why is it that so people have said
59:52 well maybe particles are trapped photons
59:55 well that may take us a level deeper but
59:58 no good models actually worked out yet
60:00 but then you say okay photon I might be
60:03 a neutrino and a neutrino pairs
60:05 thought of that well then the neutrino
60:09 and a neutrino pairs might be vortexes
60:11 and superfluid vacuum yeah and the
60:15 superfluid back event just like Turtles
60:18 all the way down so it's all possible
60:22 but you have your focus in one
60:24 particular direct yeah mikage actually
60:27 even I'm a physicist
60:29 I'm a very engineering oriented
60:31 physicist so I have a lot of focus on
60:34 how can we make something work do
60:37 something with it so yes I dive into a
60:39 deeper level of physics and many
60:41 physicists do and it's not that I'm
60:44 trying to get all the way down it's that
60:46 I want to go a level deeper find out
60:48 what the options of maybe doing
60:50 something with this level are and so I'm
60:53 focused on actually arriving
60:56 particularly at energy and propulsion
60:58 for space travel well that's great it's
61:01 great work you're doing it's an exciting
61:03 time to be in this field and there's
61:08 broad scale interest and government and
61:11 corporations
61:13 Nations I do a lot of consulting for all
61:17 three there's interest everywhere in
61:19 their ideas ok we have a question if the
61:23 speed of life is a certain thing and it
61:26 seems that thought is beyond that I mean
61:35 well it'd be nice to find out we there
61:39 haven't really been any good
61:41 measurements of the speed of thought
61:43 beside we tried once actually one of the
61:47 experiments we did because us they are
61:49 remote viewers always get bored with the
61:52 mundane cast we're giving them and so
61:54 Ingo Swann and another person by name of
61:58 Harold Sherman decided they wanted to
62:01 look at Jupiter before the NASA flyby
62:04 and so we set up a time got the tapes
62:11 rolling and they viewed Jupiter and
62:14 especially Ingo this was before the
62:17 Voyager flyby he found rings around
62:20 Jupiter and he said well I'm wonder if I
62:24 met the wrong planner I know saturn has
62:26 rings but I'm trying to get the Jupiter
62:28 but I'm seeing rings around Jupiter
62:29 don't seem to be very strong but that's
62:33 what I see somebody said ok well that's
62:36 the way it goes and then Carl Sagan
62:39 happened to come by the Institute and we
62:42 said all we'd like you look at this
62:43 material is generated by rock your and
62:46 you know he's a very skeptical kind of
62:48 guy and you read it I said well how I
62:50 see two things in here the Jesus stuff
62:53 you can get out of any encyclopedia or
62:55 the stuff that's just dead wrong
62:56 like rings around Jupiter so in Voyager
62:59 got there and found out in fact there
63:01 were thin rings around Jupiter this is
63:06 really great so what this led to was
63:07 okay well frickin
63:09 data from that distance maybe we have a
63:12 chance of measuring the speed because it
63:15 turns out that moons of Jupiter go into
63:20 eclipse at a certain time and it turns
63:23 out the Almanac only predicts it to
63:25 within a few seconds or even longer than
63:29 that so we can eliminate the possibility
63:32 somebody reads up the Almanac in advance
63:34 and then tells and so the idea is okay
63:36 are they going to see the eclipses of
63:38 the moons of Jupiter when the astronomer
63:40 sees the eclipses which means it goes
63:42 Israelite or are they going to see the
63:44 eclipses instantly before the
63:48 astronomers see which means thought was
63:50 like sort of infinitely fast so he did
63:52 you know it was a casual experiment it
63:55 wasn't really pinned down but anyway it
63:57 appeared that he was seeing it instantly
63:59 however you take into account
64:02 precognition right okay well maybe he
64:04 Precog knighted when the eclipses were
64:08 going to occur and then reported them
64:10 now so he soon realized that it's really
64:14 difficult to to take into account
64:16 possibility of precognition it's really
64:18 difficult to do an experiment to measure
64:20 speed of a say remote viewing area but
64:23 the quantum field says there's no any
64:28 way
64:51 you know if I hope that as time goes
64:55 along people were getting more open to
64:58 evaluating these things because in fact
64:59 they that that could be checked a high
65:03 velocity or high speed filming of say
65:05 birds in flight to the point where you
65:09 could measure how quick was it that they
65:12 were in alignment I mean it'd be other
65:15 factories they have to take into account
65:16 and maybe there's some other subliminal
65:18 signal I okay on the count of three
65:20 we're all gonna turn right and then one
65:22 through three that we do so you know it
65:24 wouldn't be a trivial experiment to do
65:26 it'd be an expensive experiment to do
65:28 you have to have somebody who's smart
65:32 knows how to design an experiment knows
65:35 that this is gonna have many factors and
65:37 not going to be trivial to do somebody's
65:39 going to have to pay for the time the
65:41 effort and the computer time to analyze
65:44 the experiment and I just nobody has
65:46 done again so I don't know when the
65:48 experiment about speed consciousness
65:51 their Bell's Theorem it says every point
65:54 in time and space is right next to every
65:56 other point in time space it's that in
66:00 certain well-defined
66:05 pristine experiments you can show their
66:08 non-local connections between atomic
66:11 particles photons and so on so
66:15 nonlocality is there but when time you
66:20 extrapolate up to say human being
66:24 interacting with another human being
66:25 we've got Gillian's of quantum processes
66:29 going
66:30 and you've got this not a pristine
66:33 situation could you count on that
66:35 nonlocality I'm in a certain sense since
66:38 remote-viewing works you could say well
66:41 there's non-local access phenomenality
66:43 is actually occurring well got those
66:45 experiments with rabbits where they took
66:46 the babies away from the mother and they
66:48 did something to the babies and the
66:49 mother reacted because there was this
66:51 your biological non-local connection
66:54 have you seen those I've seen them
66:56 reported it's not clear whether that
66:59 really happened or was there seing the
67:16 veil between here and there and on a
67:18 physics level how would that work I wish
67:23 I know what we need to do is to you know
67:30 have somebody who could in fact
67:32 obviously what would the physicists like
67:34 miracle worker come into my lab okay
67:36 let's perform some miracles here okay
67:38 now I see what you're doing okay let us
67:42 set up our instrumentation I performed
67:44 the miracle again you know we could get
67:46 from here to there if we had that kind
67:49 of access but you know in cases where
67:53 people apparently have miraculous events
67:58 kind of occur the kind of spontaneous of
68:00 the OM under control or even those who
68:03 have them under control to some degree
68:04 may not be at all interested and quote
68:07 demonstrating it to those stupid
68:09 scientists only interested in numbers
68:12 question or any science is interested in
68:17 cultivating those same techniques that
68:19 people who perform miracles like as long
68:21 as things like that in order to be able
68:24 to they're few and far between actually
68:28 Brian Josephson Nobel laureate known for
68:31 the Josephson Junction which is a
68:32 superconducting effect for which he got
68:36 the Nobel Prize there's also a
68:38 transcendental meditative and deep into
68:41 the cities program and so on so and he
68:45 tries various kinds of experiments to
68:49 try to connect up the science he knows
68:51 which is very profound and the
68:54 experiences he's having and so there are
68:57 a few out there and sometimes he
69:01 attempts to publish them and usually
69:03 gets rejected but the word gets around
69:05 anyway so feeling far between they have
69:09 somebody who's wearing both hands he
69:10 aims to be an example it comes to mind
69:12 well you are because I mean you can
69:14 quote it off they see Clark it's as you
69:16 know the physics of tomorrow will seem
69:18 like magic today I mean the whole idea
69:22 of wormholes where you can open up a
69:25 time-space and slip into another part of
69:29 the universe that's a possibility that
69:31 general relativity if the equations are
69:34 right that's a possibility how does that
69:36 actually work how can you actually what
69:40 do you need to do that open a wormhole
69:44 basic labor no you need a lot of energy
69:47 yeah that's one thing you need you need
69:53 to structure it in a certain way so as
69:55 to fit the vacuum you know
70:00 we can write the equations for it see
70:03 how it is it's a little hard to describe
70:06 physically I mean actually we don't
70:08 really know how to actually go out and
70:09 do it physically because there are a
70:11 little few little things like well I'm
70:13 gonna need some negative energy here
70:14 where am I going to get some negative
70:16 energy well in some sense the Casimir
70:18 effect is actually considered a negative
70:21 energy thing so okay maybe I won't I
70:23 have to have Kasmir walls around my my
70:26 wormhole and so we see the mathematics
70:30 of it can predict it if general activity
70:34 is right I mean this is enough to make
70:36 some people say general relativity must
70:38 be wrong it predicts that and there are
70:41 some other models that you know more or
70:43 less matched general relativistic
70:44 predictions but don't have that effect
70:47 in them so actually it's some level is
70:50 still sort of controversial where you
70:51 could do it but the way the math and
70:53 general relativity and signing general
70:54 relativity is now it predicts you could
70:57 do it but it would just take enormous
70:58 amounts of energy just
71:13 right
71:14 yeah it's among general relativists and
71:16 cosmologists they take it seriously it
71:19 just get published in I mean Matt Visser
71:22 one of the leading wormhole pharaohs
71:25 just published an important paper in
71:27 Physical Review Letters which is the
71:30 toughest journal to get into where he
71:33 had just done some calculations where he
71:35 showed that whereas we thought we needed
71:36 needed a lot of negative energy we can
71:39 actually get by it with just a little
71:40 bit of negative energy but of course
71:42 just figure out where to get the
71:43 negative energy from antiproton
71:47 colliders but I mean just imagine what
71:49 Einstein could have been intuitive when
71:52 he created that I mean can you get into
71:54 the mind of on sentence he what what was
71:57 he thinking in order to come up with
72:00 these ideas I mean have you been able to
72:02 do that like well now now since we're at
72:05 reading all ground that has been
72:08 elaborated for a hundred years almost or
72:14 at least 85 years in general relativity
72:16 we can pretty much get into the mind of
72:20 what he did of course he did it in just
72:22 10 years of thinking about things very
72:26 intuitively as he describes he imagined
72:28 himself you know riding on a photon away
72:31 from the clock and the clock appeared to
72:34 not change time and so does that mean
72:36 time as depends on your motion and so he
72:40 thought very intuitively
72:43 in fact he was actually quite skeptical
72:47 mathematics says there is a famous quote
72:49 of his it says well if it's
72:52 mathematically totally tight
72:54 he can't be reality and if it's reality
72:56 we can't be mathematically tight about
72:58 it and he hated learning tensor geometry
73:03 but he was forced to given that that's
73:05 the way his theory was going so we can
73:08 sort of reproduce and understand this
73:12 thinking it's no longer true that only
73:14 you know ten people in the world and
73:20 they're using it right now to do some of
73:23 these experiments that's right we have
73:25 for example the prediction of
73:27 gravitational waves there is an easy
73:32 gravitational wave we've not yet
73:34 actually seen them as close as we've
73:37 gotten is we've seen two binary pulsars
73:40 whose orbits are changing and you can
73:44 calculate how much energy they would be
73:46 losing in gravitational waves and you
73:49 can show that the decay of the orbit
73:50 matches the theoretical prediction and
73:53 for that tatom's and some other people
73:55 got a Nobel Prize but we've not actually
73:57 detected gravitational waves now we just
73:59 have coming online something called LIGO
74:03 laser interferometry gravitational
74:06 observer
74:09 which has long legs and of those
74:12 kilometers long or whatever large
74:14 interferometer whose sole purpose is to
74:17 detect gravitational waves coming from
74:19 after physical absence but no one's ever
74:21 actually major gravitational theory but
74:24 but teleportation happen to weigh the
74:27 photo I mean they have done them yes now
74:30 the teleportation is it sounds to a
74:35 layman as Oh something was here so he
74:38 disappeared Wow something it was there
74:40 it isn't exactly like that it's that you
74:43 had a photon that has certain quantum
74:45 properties and and suddenly those corner
74:51 properties were able to be reproduced
74:53 over here so and since the only way we
74:57 know about a photon is this quantum
74:59 property or then you might as well use
75:01 the word well a teleporter from here to
75:03 here because whatever was here is now
75:05 here
75:06 well how did those properties go from
75:08 here to there what was that mechanism
75:10 that got them there
75:13 actually that's not an area I'm
75:16 particularly familiar with I mean
75:18 they're very pristine experiments I mean
75:21 they do not imply that it's photons
75:24 today insects tomorrow frogs and
75:27 explained people following Saturday it's
75:29 a very pristine kind of environment I'm
75:32 not really up in the details but the
75:34 warping of space is something that you
75:36 can see definitely as possible if we get
75:39 a different G well in fact we yeah I
75:42 mean if it happens already I mean we do
75:44 see starlight invented by the Sun as it
75:47 goes by so natural things like the Sun
75:50 already warped space and so it's a case
75:54 of well gee if I had the mass of the Sun
75:57 in my pocket
75:59 I could cause like the bend around me
76:01 too right so we know in principle and we
76:05 see in practice that it happens the only
76:08 question is well you know what can we do
76:10 to do it on say laboratory spaceship
76:13 scale so the mass and the generation is
76:16 it also remote viewing and all the
76:18 psychic energy also affects mass as well
76:21 right I mean there's that phenomena like
76:24 very tuned in people like Swami's
76:26 affecting things around them well and in
76:30 principle I would think that's true and
76:34 in that particular case since I happen
76:39 to be a bug about zero-point energy is
76:41 randomness what degree can be cohered I
76:44 have as a hypothesis that a very intense
76:48 person or anybody at an intense time a
76:51 partially coherent fluctuation and that
76:54 could be measured so maybe as technology
76:58 advances and we have a lot of
77:00 easy-to-use zero-point energy or
77:03 actuation meters you know you can come
77:06 up to a sort of magical person say oh I
77:09 can see that you know you're about 6.3 77:12 on the CPU Richter scale here well your
77:15 regular though you know if you tell that
77:16 whole story but he had he's a very
77:18 intense guy with a very intense feel
77:20 that affects you know we've condensed
77:22 foods by touching memory probably comes
77:25 off of some of that intensity it's
77:28 interesting in our own particular
77:30 experiments with Geller in the
77:32 laboratory we never got under scientific
77:34 conditions where were acceptable
77:37 scientific conditions for us proves that
77:40 he can do
77:41 psychokinesis although we saw many
77:43 psychokinetic events around a casual
77:46 basis and I think that there were some
77:49 experiments done at Lawrence
77:50 or laboratory where he was doing
77:55 something on a piece of metal that was
77:59 being monitored very specifically and
78:01 they did see effects that they couldn't
78:04 account for so I think some other labs
78:07 may have gotten some data particular
78:10 case we didn't but anyway it would be
78:12 compatible with the idea that that can
78:16 fluctuation energy or some other form of
78:20 space-time work actually occurred it
78:30 seems to be defied there's so many
78:38 sociological and psychological factors
78:40 involved
78:42 he himself thought that you know maybe
78:46 the world wasn't ready for it to have it
78:49 really in their face and that's why I
78:51 couldn't do it I mean gave some other
78:55 analogies like sexual analogies was
78:57 supposed somebody put a camera and use
78:59 it okay you know you know it involves
79:04 the whole person and depends on the
79:07 environment and so in fact there are a
79:11 lot of reasons to think why I had mine
79:12 that me
79:13 well actually someone said that sexual
79:16 energy is related to some of the key key
79:18 PK energies the other sort certainly
79:21 we've heard that you read about it in
79:23 the literature but what kind of stuff do
79:24 you be heard about that
79:26 what what's the evidence what the
79:28 Association
79:30 well the association that I have heard
79:34 from people who claimed psychosomatic
79:36 events was that at the time they felt
79:41 sexual so it's a sort of subjective or
79:45 maybe more energy running through their
79:46 whole body in general which stimulates
79:48 all the organs you know so it's all very
79:53 exciting anymore I mean we just
80:00 the second law of thermodynamics and
80:03 well both in space-time but apparently
80:07 in quantum energy it doesn't apply or
80:12 there's no real translation between
80:16 order to disorder because it goes back
80:19 and forth that's why it's it's a new
80:22 area actually in thermodynamics that
80:24 people have recognized and the second
80:27 law which basically the law just does
80:29 everything kind of runs down and gets
80:30 more to sort of higher entropy States
80:34 and server quantum systems under certain
80:39 conditions there are violations of that
80:45 at some level and so this whole thing
80:48 about quantum thermodynamics is a new
80:52 area that just just the past year
80:54 they've been a couple of papers
80:55 published here with zero fetal how can
81:00 you define an entropy because energy
81:05 that's right really if there are
81:08 thermodynamics as we usually know it and
81:09 love it it is really a classical concept
81:12 that applies easily on the classical
81:13 level it only has to do with statistics
81:16 of having a bunch of things that are
81:18 well-defined and you statistically
81:20 randomly mix them up and like shuffling
81:23 a big my cards time to get in the
81:24 quantum level where you got in
81:26 distinguishability between particles and
81:28 there they're not there I mean the rules
81:31 well being a closed system entropy
81:35 perhaps works but in an open system
81:37 which seems like we live in that kind of
81:39 universe that's always being influenced
81:41 by this vacuum this quantum fluctuations
81:43 we haven't open certain Li priggish in
81:46 got his Nobel Prize for pointing out
81:48 that and a human being is a good example
81:51 I mean we are ordered in our environment
81:56 as compared to just random molecules
81:58 floating around and but it's because
82:00 part of that requirement is that there
82:02 is open access to energies that we are
82:05 an open system so that's true from the
82:07 standpoint of a zero-point energy
82:09 theorist everything is an open system
82:12 right and it seems like even perhaps the
82:15 theory that sons are our dark holes and
82:17 some other universe that are pouring out
82:19 like have you heard that
82:21 oh yeah the black holes your white balls
82:23 yeah
82:27 these days almost no matter what you
82:30 would say to a physicist he's got to say
82:32 that's possibility right the physics is
82:34 just expanding thank you so much for the
82:39 work and intelligence and passion you're
82:41 bringing to the field of physics Center
82:44 thank you thanks takes that right and
82:49 they're talking to how put off
82:51 one of the founders of the remote
82:53 viewing programs at the CIA use he's
82:56 investigating the access of zero-point
82:59 energy and quantum fluctuations to power
83:01 the planet Earth I would think oh boy
83:04 what's your website doing just give you
83:06 one time if you care the WWWF tech or
83:11 earth tech is one word ei R th te CH
83:16 thanks hit me cover anymore this is new

==========L_X5pXiXJEs==========

00:09 you know in reading some of the material
00:11 is something called the cosmological
00:12 constant where the relationship of the
00:15 electron is somehow related to the size
00:19 of the universe we could the universe
00:21 itself be an electron in some greater
00:23 vaster and I had been talked about the
00:27 fact that the universe when you look at
00:29 the numbers associated that they could
00:31 itself be a black hole when a in a black
00:33 hole yeah who knows how many others are
00:36 out there actually this idea that you
00:39 just mentioned about well couldn't we be
00:41 like the small component and they're
00:43 much larger there are a lot of serious
00:46 theoretical work by cosmologists about
00:50 the possibility that our whole universe
00:53 is just one of many yeah Linda Sanford
00:58 is Russian is now there it's Hanford is
01:01 one of the most respected cosmologists
01:04 he's an opinion that well this universe
01:08 got spawned there's no reason why
01:10 another one couldn't today is no better
01:12 than yesterday so maybe it's like a
01:14 fractal tree of the university being
01:16 spawned all over the place on a
01:18 continuing basis we just happened not to
01:20 be connecting up with them but then even
01:24 that theory is going to step further
01:25 where now people are talking about yeah
01:27 but maybe sometimes these universes run
01:29 into each other and then you have a big
01:31 release of energy
01:32 maybe that's behind some of these many
01:35 quasars or whatever so these days
01:39 cosmology and astrophysics is
01:41 outstripping science fiction so fasting
01:43 and how to keep up with and the theories
01:45 are proliferating and in the old days we
01:47 had a wild theory might be Shawn but
01:51 these days the data is coming in so fast
01:52 and we have so many inexplicable
01:55 phenomenon going on basically it's okay
01:59 in physics now to have really that
02:03 you're going to try to check against a
02:04 well then what's one of your favorite
02:06 inexplicable theories where the energy
02:11 from quasars comes from our gamma-ray
02:14 burster there was a gamma-ray burster
02:20 just a few years ago that basically as
02:23 far as we can tell released more energy
02:26 second only to the big bangs accounting
02:32 for that it's difficult and there are
02:35 actually a number of papers have been
02:36 published on the idea that maybe it was
02:39 in fact there are papers called Casimir
02:43 collapse of supernovae indicating that
02:45 maybe some obviously more that we don't
02:51 know that we do know is I mean now it's
02:54 really getting down to the embarrassing
02:56 point where we recognize that 4% of the
03:01 universe we can account for and the
03:04 other 96% is in dark matter and dark
03:07 energy and we don't know what either the
03:08 mark but you know it's interesting that
03:11 it used to be ages ago religion was the
03:14 big thing right and then a certain point
03:17 in our development we carved out a piece
03:20 of religion
03:21 all that philosophy and then we carved
03:25 out a piece of philosophy and called it
03:26 natural science and in that transition
03:30 I've always marveled at the fact that
03:31 what was alchemy then became chemistry
03:35 what was astrology became astronomy what
03:39 was metaphysics became physics and thus
03:43 always gets to go to my psychology
03:45 friends what was demonology became
03:47 psychology and that process was a
03:50 process whereby we're trying to get rid
03:53 of the subjective element make it
03:54 totally objective unfortunately in that
03:57 process we somewhat threw out some of
04:00 the baby with the bathwater
04:02 but I think it was a necessary step to
04:04 go through to get the subjective element
04:05 out but now that science has gotten its
04:10 legs and it's somewhat strong it's
04:12 beginning to reincorporate so for
04:14 example we have astrology saying you
04:17 know things depend on the Stars or
04:19 knowing yet chemistry there's no
04:20 subjective factors now it's been
04:23 recognized pretty much by scientists or
04:25 open-minded that there is a so-called
04:27 Mars effect that is people born under
04:30 the sign of Mars happen to be you know
04:33 fill up the books for athletes and
04:36 similarly numerology which then became
04:39 mathematics so the magic of numbers kind
04:41 of went away but now that we have
04:44 Mathematica being realized that
04:45 principles like supersymmetry are kind
04:47 of saying there is a magical aspect of
04:50 mathematics assembly
04:53 from alchemy to chemistry I mean you can
04:56 pull it off you see Clark that says you
04:58 know the physics of tomorrow will seem
05:00 like magic today really if we had truly
05:05 the physics of the universe and
05:07 everything would be in there so the fact
05:09 that everything isn't in there we know a
05:11 lot of but I make myself feel better but
05:16 I realized it there's going to be a 26th
05:18 century mosaics my 32 second century
05:21 physics whatever that physics is they're
05:24 gonna look back at 21st century physics
05:26 and say oh how can they believe that
05:28 stuff is so limited it's so primitive so
05:32 clearly as time goes on we're gonna
05:36 we're already getting little snippets of
05:39 connection between these things but we
05:40 really have a lot of work to do I don't
05:42 have to say nothing makes you more
05:45 humble than being a physicist facing the
05:47 reality then you realize you can't
05:49 stitch ammonia
05:52 you

00:00 okay one of the discoveries that emerged
00:01 out of modern quantum theory is that
00:05 so-called empty space isn't really empty
00:07 at all it's actually full of energy so
00:11 instead of being like kind of a quiet
00:13 empty lake it's more like the froth of
00:15 the base of a waterfall or something and
00:17 this energy is basically electromagnetic
00:19 in nature and the energy density is
00:23 quite high in fact it's so high that
00:26 when it was first discovered
00:27 mathematically it was thought to be some
00:29 kind of artifact of the mathematics but
00:32 then as time went on there were even
00:34 Nobel prize-winning experiments that
00:36 showed that this energy and so called an
00:39 empty space was really there
00:41 we don't usually notice it because it's
00:44 so homogeneous ly distributed it sort of
00:47 be like sitting in a bathtub with at
00:50 exactly your body temperature you might
00:51 not notice notice the water but under
00:54 certain circumstances it can be
00:57 disturbed or perturbed and then it has
01:00 has effects as I mentioned some some
01:03 effects on atomic emission for example
01:06 is what eventually ended up in a Nobel
01:09 Prize for Willis lamb of Yale University
01:12 is called the lamb shift and this is a
01:14 recognition that in fact this energy
01:16 disturbs atoms so atoms aren't sitting
01:19 in a void they're sitting in the sea of
01:20 energy
01:21 so once quantum theorists realized that
01:24 energy was there the next question was
01:25 well is there any way to tap it and it
01:29 was thought originally that probably not
01:32 it might be like trying to tap the heat
01:33 energy around us and you can quickly
01:37 prove for a thermodynamic reasons that
01:40 it'll take more energy to tap it then
01:43 you'd get out of it so you don't come
01:45 out ahead
01:45 but back in about 1984 researcher a huge
01:49 laboratory of the name of Robert forward
01:52 showed that there was a particular
01:54 effect called the Casimir effect which
01:57 demonstrated that in fact this energy
01:59 could be tapped well when you go to look
02:01 at the numbers you find out that there's
02:04 enough energy and the volume of a coffee
02:06 cup to evaporate all the world's oceans
02:08 if you could get it all about
02:11 so this raised the issue among theorists
02:15 well can we manipulate this energy could
02:19 be a tap it for spaceflight application
02:21 for example and there a couple ways to
02:26 go could we get propulsion out of it
02:28 could we use it as an energy source and
02:31 so these are the areas that art and
02:34 theorists are looking at but one of the
02:36 more interesting aspects is that if in
02:38 fact it does look like there's a route
02:39 from here to there then you know we
02:42 consider the possibility that well maybe
02:43 there are other civilizations who've
02:45 been down this track ahead of us and so
02:48 it opens up the possibility you can't
02:49 reject the possibility of for example et
02:53 visitations out of hand 

=========xDx1po_apZU=========

00:00 I think exploration for inviting me to
00:01 give this talk and thinking Daniel
00:03 Sheehan and Dominic are the invitation
00:06 and the courtesy and the comfort of the
00:09 nice hotel
00:10 basically I'm here to talk on behalf of
00:12 my colleague mark Melissa and I are the
00:15 co editors of the book that was
00:17 published last February of 2009 the
00:20 double-a presses bit frontiers of
00:23 profession science and there's the book
00:25 cover and the book was designed to be an
00:29 academic monograph for the purpose of
00:32 reaching advanced undergraduate students
00:35 graduate students faculty airspace and
00:38 physics professors who are interested in
00:40 exploring propulsion physics as well as
00:44 that industry scientist we start with
00:47 our aspirations aspirations are always
00:51 provided by the wonderful science
00:53 fiction that we have in world literature
00:55 that have inspired midnight motorists we
00:58 know long deceased and who've in spite
01:01 of the my generation and the other
01:03 generations to come
01:04 and basically before 1994 where Brad was
01:09 only a science fiction that since that
01:12 time that the advent of algae-based were
01:14 broad metric theory that was published
01:15 in classical quantum gravity the
01:17 principles have now been postulated here
01:21 the merge of scientific progress has
01:23 observed that we start with Einstein's
01:25 general theory of relativity and the
01:27 evolution of quantum mechanics
01:29 electrodynamics Bundys negative mass
01:32 potential Bob for loops guidelines to
01:35 anti-gravity which appeared in the
01:36 film's rather than American Journal of
01:38 physics there's something that said Kip
01:41 Thorne and his grad students derived the
01:44 first solution for traversable in his
01:46 and then part but now came along with is
01:49 our claim of a gravity shield fall
01:51 al-kabir publication in the journal of
01:53 classical quantum gravity of work drive
01:56 they have been house and co-authors help
02:00 Rodolfo and so forth and their shelves
02:02 as a quantum drag effect called vacuum
02:05 bag and chimney lives first patent on
02:07 his transient market inertial thruster
02:10 and not visitors publication and his new
02:13 answer in his book which was a component
02:15 of everything published from 1988 to
02:18 1995 all in traditional Bavarian has
02:22 everything he learned that are about him
02:24 including time machines and that was
02:26 peddled by the American Institute of
02:27 Physics press and they like this at the
02:31 beginning of the day for propulsion
02:33 physics program that he was the manager
02:36 for at NASA Glenn he has a space drawed
02:39 concepts and issues and how put out my
02:41 boss has developed the polarizable
02:44 vacuum and propulsion George Hathaway
02:47 was looking at an old test of the power
02:49 of gravity shield and Jade and clay and
02:52 Bob Ford we're looking at quantum vacuum
02:54 energy propulsion so you have that
02:56 progress and that's just not that's not
02:58 anything that's not an all-inclusive
03:00 list there were many other fields many
03:03 other topics and physics that were being
03:05 evaluated the books purpose was to look
03:08 at comparing all the possibilities of
03:10 the different types of breakthrough
03:12 propulsion physics that would be
03:13 proposed by various investigators around
03:15 the world not just the hot topics when
03:18 we are interested exploring the physics
03:20 aerospace engineers and managers without
03:22 any higher
03:23 because this is the point the people
03:25 that work with the policy makers in
03:26 government they get the funding they
03:28 start the programs and they execute them
03:30 and unfortunately the aerospace
03:33 engineers are at the cutting edge of
03:34 physics physicists are so the idea is to
03:37 pay the cutting edge of physics the
03:38 filtering and bakery out the the
03:41 out-of-the-box ideas to the people in
03:44 aerospace engineering who can hopefully
03:45 take program develop problems based on
03:48 these ideas in order to show it can be
03:50 done that could be done next in the way
03:54 of here's that we may now here's what's
03:57 unresolved and so there's unfinished
04:00 business for students and pioneers to
04:02 wrap up just to work on to solve
04:04 problems on the diamonds to distinguish
04:08 films from frontier where that is very
04:10 important because this subject is batted
04:13 they deal initially at the very
04:15 beginning and it still does to a little
04:17 small what much smaller degree a lot of
04:19 division for the ministry an academic
04:21 community because they know the physics
04:24 they said they may look at the numbers
04:25 they look at the equations and say they
04:27 say to themselves well breakthrough
04:28 profession physician or such thing they
04:30 will drive the wormholes these things
04:32 are impossible to attain so they think
04:35 that that kind of stuff is to science
04:37 fiction for them to dive into but often
04:39 beers paper Morrison theories both are
04:41 paper that visitors built and so forth
04:44 have a brought that into mainstream
04:46 physics or here's this is the first
04:49 witness book that covers the concept of
04:51 gravity control propulsion faster than
04:53 light travel related energy conversion
04:56 and managing such research in our 18 05:01 years authors 2712 offers 22 chapters on
05:05 this alien of pages took us on this
05:07 three years to put the book together and
05:09 as a varieties in favor to that in
05:10 envision correctly approaching 2,000 05:12 copies sold and it's actually a
05:14 best-seller for the inaudible a press in
05:17 that series
05:18 nearly these series and progress of
05:22 astronautics and Aeronautics are usually
05:24 jet engine development
05:25 rocket fuel's rocket engineer dynamics
05:28 astrodynamics and things like that so
05:30 this was a smash head for these guys
05:32 mark and I over the other news and of
05:35 the lead author affiliations 40% didn't
05:38 also thirteen percent whatever the US
05:40 government labs and thirty percent were
05:42 private industry consultants with ten
05:44 percent a university is 70 percent for
05:46 and here's the list of authors some of
05:50 who maybe wanted to if anyone was going
05:53 to be desperately letter Jimmy would
05:55 work and what it is my boss all put off
05:57 and some of these names you may not
06:01 recognize but you may recognize Bob
06:02 forward we have this power a period of
06:05 years which were pulled from the LR
06:07 devil a nuclear and future Floyd
06:09 Technical Committee they have every a
06:11 stands for the American Institute of
06:13 Aeronautics and Astronautics and it's a
06:15 worldwide aerospace professional Society
06:17 it's been around since the beginning of
06:19 the 60s and it was a major of the rel
06:22 canonical' society with the American
06:23 Astronomical Society there are these
06:26 were our period years the organization
06:31 the belt started this way began in
06:33 understanding the problem which is
06:37 looking at the history of Aitkin for
06:38 patient physics and as it was done by
06:41 organizations like my Institute project
06:45 we lowered the NASA program and so forth
06:48 including our days in the context and
06:49 then evaluating the limits of
06:51 interstellar technology based on the
06:53 advanced physics that we know like solar
06:55 cells in power propulsion and antimatter
06:58 rockets nuclear propulsion and so forth
07:01 profession without rocket that was
07:03 looking at a real journey of reaction in
07:07 space drives without violating the new
07:09 conservation that recover space drive
07:11 physics pioneers gravity control
07:13 non-viable ages and other approaches
07:16 then the faster the on travel will be
07:18 based on faster concepts in general to
07:22 researchers traversable inhales and
07:24 web-browser have been faster by
07:27 communications and quantum physics by a
07:29 low mortality event
07:31 considerations basically licking
07:34 animation from the quantum vacuum energy
07:35 from sanity lessons and non-viable
07:38 attention places like possible cold
07:40 fusion and magnetic motors and things
07:42 like that from this player failure at
07:45 this part of the book published the
07:46 computation tears and conventions needed
07:49 to have a universe away which when we
07:52 talk about these things what kind of
07:54 computer programs are applicable for
07:56 evaluating breakthrough propulsion
07:58 physics translating different orders of
08:00 physics into a common injury anything
08:02 and then how to do pioneering research
08:05 they I've investigated to make that is
08:08 to understand the fact that spaceflight
08:10 is really hard folks if you look at this
08:12 log scale to find out as we go further
08:15 and further out of the solar system and
08:16 further through the Kuiper belt out to
08:18 the aircar now blowing all the way to
08:21 Alpha Centauri which is about him just
08:24 inside of a million astronomical units
08:27 about half a million astronomical units
08:29 you see about the technique and energy
08:33 demand infrastructure and change in
08:36 velocity is gets harder and harder and
08:38 harder and harder so I keep this picture
08:41 in mind as we progress further into the
08:43 talk here when you look at that picture
08:45 we want to say well if they're going to
08:47 have a profession technology how much
08:49 propeller is going to be needed we will
08:51 look at an example propeller required
08:53 for the mass of the Space Shuttle
08:54 Orbiter past 43 light-years so you have
08:58 a three axis trophy or showing the pilot
09:01 mass increasing in this direction on
09:04 nine axis and then rocket efficiency
09:07 given in terms of its specific impulse
09:09 and seconds increases fairly well
09:12 and fission bomb propulsion to the
09:14 antimatter rocket 250 thousand second
09:17 specific impulse so Rockets get better
09:20 that axis and then of course we have
09:23 mission adoration the trips get along
09:25 the along my toxins and where you learn
09:27 from this kind of thing is through the
09:30 look at this you see but with specific
09:33 impulse in a few thousands of seconds
09:35 you're gonna need about 10 billion super
09:38 tape there's a propellant in the
09:39 dictionary will there's the specific
09:42 impulse increases then the propellant
09:44 mass drops dramatically that's very less
09:47 however consequently the duration of the
09:51 mission is going to be a thousand years
09:52 if you want to shorten in addition to me
09:55 reasonable within a lifespan then as you
09:58 see the propellant requiring that your
10:00 skyrockets back up again and that's what
10:02 you wave for this use and conventionally
10:04 until you in physics and this is what
10:06 the purpose of our research is about is
10:08 how do we overcome this terrible issue
10:10 well Bob frisbee who's now retired for
10:13 the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
10:15 dead-ass started in our bulky but
10:17 Davison 85-page chopper 2 and here's the
10:21 graph of the cruise speed velocity of an
10:23 interstellar mission versus the trip
10:25 time and then each of these diagonal
10:27 values represent interstellar features
10:30 or planetary features and hair style
10:32 features at increasing distance for
10:34 example the heliopause is out of here
10:37 today
10:38 line and the gravitational is of the Sun
10:40 is at 550 Lu here and the Kuiper belt is
10:44 4,200 to 1000 I will not ban your cloud
10:48 rise within this bound and this is
10:50 interstellar distance from 33 10:52 light-years the fading light so that
10:53 would be a vision mission so they're
10:56 going to look at the fact that the layer
10:58 of the increase velocity the rather it's
11:01 going to take to get there
11:02 the faster you go the shorter this time
11:06 it's going to take you to get there and
11:07 then you compare this the requirement of
11:11 the propulsion capabilities that are
11:12 going to be able to meet those
11:13 requirements so here Bob frisbee took a
11:16 look and saw how these propulsion
11:18 technologies NEP is nuclear electric
11:21 propulsion and so how they mash in how
11:23 they cut across the slice of the
11:25 distance versus time versus speed axis
11:29 and here the other part of the
11:31 professional capabilities that we
11:32 theater-style initially matter
11:34 antimatter beam energy and fusion Ram
11:36 Jackson so badass he took a look at the
11:38 anus of interstellar flight technology
11:40 he looked at those profession concepts
11:42 and apply two filters a bag of v
11:45 capability man against the change of
11:47 velocity needed to be there and to get
11:49 to the cruise speedy the infrastructure
11:51 requirements are like how big can you
11:53 build your talents to carry the
11:55 propellant as well as radiation
11:57 shielding within the potential system
11:59 and so forth and then the technology
12:01 requirements on building it and we apply
12:03 these three folders and as say for that
12:05 last big list of possibilities they
12:08 start getting really them into very few
12:11 number of possibilities self-serving a
12:14 questionable you know a theory of a new
12:15 definitely else they survived all three
12:17 failure so it's not very helpful so a
12:22 proportion talk now this tells us
12:23 application technology even to the even
12:26 fish to the raiment of innovative
12:28 physics is basically an adequate for
12:30 timely interstellar flight to circumvent
12:32 these new limits are these limits we
12:34 gotta have the new propulsion physics of
12:35 some sort even if the
12:38 impossible investigating physics in
12:40 terms of spaceflight introduces new
12:42 perspectives to solving the mysteries of
12:45 science may optimistically of
12:47 reification physicists discovered a new
12:49 class of technologies would result in
12:51 revolutionize in space flight and
12:52 enabling humanity to reach the other
12:55 debate of the stars here's an envelop
12:58 that mark likes to use show people its
13:01 history repeating itself to exceed the
13:03 limits apply our technology we want to
13:05 see entirely different technology and
13:08 that was given from the book by
13:10 fostering titled innovation the
13:12 attackers advantage publishing 86 here
13:14 is showing that the Masters that have
13:16 mastered a certain type of technology
13:19 are using incremental evolutionary
13:21 approach to improve the technology till
13:23 it fills performance flatlines that
13:26 revolutionary pioneers engage in
13:29 research and develop disruptive in
13:31 disruptive innovations that basically
13:34 lead to revolutionary technologies that
13:36 they're way above the performance
13:38 flatline so basically we're looking at
13:42 compare revolutionary research twelve
13:45 additional research we master the know
13:47 like how they mastered said that our
13:50 Savior technology and the sea and
13:52 advanced it back in tubes if they may we
13:56 have the piston driven propeller
13:59 fighters that we advanced among the
14:01 really line
14:02 with the future recorded the main
14:05 concept so this is what an example of
14:08 evolutionary research mastery what we
14:10 already know is looks like and then
14:12 revolutionary research leads to the
14:14 invention of the steam engine which may
14:16 beyond the concept of using cells to
14:19 generate thrust sized a transistors the
14:23 jet engine and hopefully in the future
14:25 warp drives an example of revolutionary
14:28 research there very things that we
14:32 discovered in the abated profession
14:34 physics program at NASA is without a
14:36 look at these three things now speed and
14:38 energy because really propulsion methods
14:42 that eliminate the need for propellant
14:45 or beaming energy you just don't want to
14:47 take so much with you how can we have a
14:49 fast interstellar trip without having to
14:51 drive all that power with you or are
14:53 that propellant the energy source is the
14:56 big driver of the engineering speed to
14:59 spend it all is simply whether existing
15:00 units like light speed limit to
15:01 dramatically reduce trans at times and
15:03 that leads to faster and light
15:04 considerations and energy are leaves us
15:07 to what methods do we have available to
15:10 power these these types of technologies
15:12 or these types of physics the
15:15 state-of-the-art assessment that we've
15:16 looked at now shows that no big things
15:18 are aiming it at this time
15:19 most research that's being done that
15:22 steps more to in the scientific method
15:23 which is just defining the problem and
15:25 collecting the data theoretically and
15:27 some empirically some research has been
15:30 on as far as stop stealing fair which is
15:32 fairly hypothesis and testing it and
15:34 then the degree of activities use dozens
15:37 of research they publish directly
15:39 related our papers they publish publish
15:43 directly related to billions okay other
15:45 system should have said their papers
15:46 were directly related to goals hundreds
15:48 of researchers covered related basic
15:50 physics now a recent phase work their
15:52 mistress credibility and Pete's progress
15:54 so there's a lot of this going on and
15:57 this is the problem that has to be
15:59 avoided because this is where theta
16:00 sweet word concerns federal policymakers
16:03 when it comes to time to asking for
16:05 funding for these type of projects when
16:09 we look at the women maybe our physics
16:11 to break through spaceflight
16:14 those foundations of the main physics
16:16 that we're looking at now by plugging
16:17 back in zero point energies
16:19 dark energy dark matter of the Big Bang
16:22 and quantum entanglement in
16:24 teleportation and what we're asking is
16:27 whether than unresolved questions in
16:29 these area of physics and then we look
16:31 at the debut of envision slightly faster
16:33 right in the end of the stars what are
16:35 the critical issues in the lens of the
16:37 physics and news and you find that
16:38 there's the collision where these two
16:40 sides intersect the intersection reveals
16:43 the important problems that need to be
16:45 solved they live in vain through
16:46 profession conference our concept and
16:49 this is the foundation of a bill is
16:52 making out rigorous foundations of what
16:54 we know in physics and what are the
16:56 unknowns and then what we desire for our
16:59 future space transport system for
17:01 interstellar travel and then we're there
17:03 intersection occurs is what we are doing
17:07 in the bill to explain so here are the
17:10 vision bigger goals mass speed and
17:14 energy as I described earlier and then
17:16 read the bill may envision concepts and
17:18 categories and then here are the
17:20 rigorous foundations of science that we
17:22 well the now let's hear the trades the
17:25 theories the spa and the curiosities
17:27 that come out of those areas of science
17:29 and then in the middle of the important
17:31 problems intersection and I mean you
17:37 could see there's quite a detailed chart
17:39 of very well highly interconnected
17:42 concepts it's too long there's only
17:46 enough time for me to go through this
17:47 but these are all the concepts that we
17:49 evaluated in the book in those 22 17:52 chapters but we've only looked at a
17:54 couple of these topics the books table
17:57 of contents is laid out there like this
18:00 we have to fail written by Barrett
18:02 returned we originally had arthur c
18:03 clarke but he died while was we human in
18:05 a script so we
18:07 asked our good friend that we tend to
18:08 occasionally and do the and do that for
18:11 us so we have to the contextual history
18:15 of breakthrough propulsion physics was
18:17 done by Paul Wester who is a space
18:18 journalist he has the Centauri Dreams
18:21 website his about frisbees chapter Mark
18:25 Miller says the chapters and space
18:27 drives I've got gravity control George
18:30 Hathaway in Toronto has fabulous
18:33 superconductors and my environment
18:35 mechanical devices is a anti-gravity
18:38 gyros which have been tested and shown
18:41 not to be anti-gravity they're basically
18:43 they basically are non-volatile
18:45 anti-gravity devices the on the shooter
18:47 examination is done by Steve authority
18:49 at the Air Force Academy it's electric
18:52 gravity unification that that was an oil
18:55 test counts and very lifters we are a
18:59 two chapters cover that because that is
19:01 a long very a several decade old concept
19:05 that people have been fighting over or
19:07 the finally found out that telling
19:09 somebody if there's have nothing to do
19:10 is they appointed you nothing to do with
19:12 electro gravity it's not even oil in its
19:15 neutral particle and they have testing
19:18 Dennett national some mash Sandia
19:20 National Laboratory by a mere a tile and
19:23 clarity is a private investigator
19:25 scientists in the defense industry who
19:28 did is also and then he said others
19:30 other topics that we've covered
19:31 yesterday this the quantum vacuum
19:33 initializer stochastic Petri dynamics
19:35 relativistic spaceflight or faster no
19:38 topics faster light communications
19:41 space powers zero point energy Steiner
19:44 in Russells free energy curves
19:47 computational tools so now we're going
19:49 to get into there a couple of the topics
19:51 where drives
19:52 oh so you make it work drives and they
19:57 ask the question is it possible and the
19:59 answer is yes Einstein's theory is where
20:01 we'll go paint them that's where our
20:03 Kabir discover the metric by looking at
20:06 how do I wanna leave a ship the space at
20:09 web speed how does it work
20:10 the ship looks like it's ball surfing on
20:13 a wave of space-time faster than light
20:15 but yeah the reference frame the ship is
20:17 in it's not violating the special
20:19 relativity principle because the
20:21 spaceship is with an inertial frame
20:23 that's always traveling less than light
20:25 that it's the remote observers outside
20:27 that we abundant that we're better fed
20:30 up by negative vacuum energy that
20:32 creates this will drive effect when they
20:35 were outside looking at this they say
20:37 this thing
20:38 transitive space our super limited
20:40 speeds and it's absolute supreme speeds
20:43 not effective the energy required
20:45 however is extremely high and the unity
20:48 of the SteriPEN to a negative mass
20:50 equivalence because your carriers you
20:53 out of the Balaton is called sub balki
20:54 energy and this is the most difficult
20:57 thing to engineer commercially and those
21:01 are different genre nothing moves except
21:04 the traveler you set up the negative
21:05 energy shell and this is a this is a
21:09 fictitious diagram this is not a world
21:10 where they live site this is called a
21:12 thorn diagram and a flam diagram is a
21:15 constant picture in time and radius and
21:18 we're looking at a constant angle theta
21:21 and so this not particular spherical and
21:24 safer so we're just taking a slice
21:26 through constant only one angle so
21:28 basically we're going to have a field
21:29 with negative energy that has odd
21:31 replace of gravitational force it dishes
21:33 space out
21:34 wholesome fear dopant keeps it from
21:36 collapse and there's no event horizon
21:38 were singularity like a block wall so
21:40 travelers should be able to go inside
21:42 that now and then through the fear
21:44 without didn't we depart and come out
21:46 the other side the night stay at PNA
21:48 which is the a theory right but KB which
21:50 is serious this is me on this space this
21:53 is the normos based on continuing what
21:55 you would really otherwise travel
21:56 through but this is a shortcut through
21:58 hyperspace need and you get there in
22:00 just a matter of seconds there's a big
22:04 valentine square wave made out nobody on
22:08 the Sony you can see what kind of
22:10 there's a galaxy there when his
22:13 anti-gravitational out they can't
22:16 activate now I like to call that snooze
22:18 they that know when there's actually
22:21 acting like a spherical Christmas
22:23 ornament a spherical one's so the image
22:26 on the inside coming from the other side
22:27 of the world now is basically distorted
22:31 and inverted there's a flat Wien whole
22:34 one of us can take many shapes that can
22:36 be spherical that to be fact that that
22:38 we retain the way that can be polyhedral
22:39 and self-worth so any of the concepts of
22:45 all where drives a locality basically in
22:51 the unresolved issues are the
22:52 unobtainable mad about energy negative
22:55 ten of the formula tools required to
22:57 create a 100 meter diameter wheel bubble
23:01 so that you can only have a wave the
23:03 very corners per second it gets it's
23:06 still bad really even today the speed of
23:08 the snails crawl when a day as they as a
23:10 snails crawl it's about negative 20 or
23:12 30 something channels so the this is
23:15 this is based on the energy study done
23:18 by Matt visitors colleagues who looked
23:20 at the gravitational interaction between
23:21 web bubble the spaceship and they were
23:24 perfect in the space time and the energy
23:27 conditions and basically we they
23:30 discovered that it deprives you just
23:32 impractical if you've been out that this
23:34 mission negative energy pulled out of
23:35 the vacuum the basically it's
23:37 impractical to use another native energy
23:39 conditions or the conditions are what
23:41 allows you to create that kind of energy
23:43 out of the vacuum control ability is are
23:47 causally disconnected since i've been
23:49 you created world bevel the starship is
23:51 not able to causally connect to it
23:53 you're not able to control it so about
23:55 maybe problem you always have closed
23:56 timelike curves or time machines in work
23:58 drives and wormholes and momentum
24:01 conservation hasn't been evaluated on
24:03 this caveat though by saying that
24:05 Einstein's general theory field
24:07 equations already have conservation was
24:09 built into them it's just out there
24:11 having been demonstrated explicitly by
24:13 any of the theorists are john cream
24:15 requirement more locality by looking at
24:18 virtual causal communication and that it
24:20 is communicating backwards in time by
24:22 way of a corner entitlement experiment
24:25 so this is what the book sections look
24:27 like four-wheel drives Indian Hills and
24:30 interconnected out of the rigorous known
24:33 things the unknown of the interesting
24:35 curiosities then the hypothesis and test
24:38 of the vacuum fluctuations that are
24:41 needed to create the negative energy
24:42 issues in their names and the concepts
24:46 of their of the goal vision driven of
24:48 the day up of the veil driven visions
24:50 that's right it is that john cream is
24:55 experimental design for a retro causal
24:58 experience for FTL suddenly and i don't
25:01 have too much time to talk about that
25:03 but that's in the book this is martin
25:05 else's notion of space drives he's
25:07 making that you know without violating
25:09 in momentum energy conservation is there
25:11 where we can manipulate space-time or
25:13 inertial frames back to create a space
25:16 drive that would submit a differential
25:18 sale or an induction sir or a diode sale
25:21 and these are just a fairly straight of
25:23 purposes only and he's looking at thrust
25:26 and pressure in area calculations as a
25:29 way of deriving a conceptualization of
25:31 these things and this is you know
25:34 metadata above a of some sort or change
25:37 initial frames would push on that in
25:38 space and so this is what he's kind of
25:41 thinking in his mind he would like to
25:43 see happen but then here's another way
25:47 this is the soap bubble analogy of the
25:51 space-time be worked in such a way that
25:54 that pushes you forward okay and so this
26:01 is the initial for notifications
26:02 propulsion so these are the concepts be
26:05 explored that Bob Forge gravitational
26:07 dipole Martin Taylor is for validating
26:10 device and here the concepts that are
26:13 involved in the biggest foundations and
26:16 curiosities have been the theory of
26:18 envisions the concepts and categories
26:19 and then everything that intersection
26:22 between that needs to be studied
26:24 space drive science issues they are made
26:27 in two dozen approaches to eliminate all
26:29 specific issues and opportunities their
26:31 objections and objectives
26:33 conservation of momentum net external
26:35 force that is your conservation because
26:37 remember Newton's third law says option
26:40 equals reaction and we don't know
26:43 everything that has reaction with drives
26:45 well drive is probably the closest I
26:48 think to meeting this definition because
26:51 there is no there is no use of news
26:54 they've now it doesn't need to occur our
26:57 tradition Bavarian here's that's a
26:59 different story
26:59 a commercially named he was a fixated
27:01 thing in space so it's a fixed total the
27:04 Explorer is doing is doing the moving
27:06 he's going to be a rocket he's going to
27:08 health to expel propellant or in here to
27:11 move forward through the air hole but
27:12 that's okay because the window is a
27:13 shortcut so did seem to study
27:16 interstellar distances very quickly and
27:18 so there's nothing out there are you
27:20 solve curiosities I can issue Fame for
27:22 meters we don't know basically from the
27:25 earliest times during their initial
27:26 frames come from you don't know how they
27:28 are
27:28 it's the fundamental basis of it
27:30 generates are these big out of inertial
27:32 frame but we don't know about much about
27:34 it other than that machs piece of
27:35 space-time density this is interesting
27:38 this is not a experimental error here
27:40 mark
27:40 if this was 10 to the negative n plus or
27:42 minus 26 kilogram per cubic meter this
27:45 is the way she say the arranging for the
27:47 tend to be negative way to 10 to the 26 27:50 and I thought was a bad way very not
27:53 docking according back in density this
27:56 is again a ways it's not representative
27:59 of our measuring error this is represent
28:01 the better table is right there this is
28:03 the better table I tell you we won't
28:05 experience the many look at the density
28:08 of space-time because this gives us an
28:09 idea what can we do to manipulate
28:11 initial feelings or a better space-time
28:14 so you look at the density of their
28:15 matter they are depressed dark matter
28:18 and it helped us to have the same mass
28:21 densities dark energy based on the
28:23 misery of time to a supernova redshift
28:27 far out and
28:28 the edge of the universe the mass
28:30 density is telling the negative
28:31 twenty-six kilograms per cubic meter the
28:33 energy density of the Nano joule per
28:35 cubic meter if you take the
28:38 electromagnetic zero energy and you
28:40 integrated to the nucleon Compton
28:42 frequency this is the energy basis this
28:44 is the mass density you get from that
28:46 energy and I think this would be
28:48 intended 113 Joule per cubic meter and
28:51 then look at these numbers are compared
28:54 to the days module is calculated for jdi
28:57 eternity the stress versus strain which
28:59 is the gravitational coupling constant
29:01 out there in Einstein's field equations
29:03 relating the geometry will on the left
29:06 and the space and letter the matter
29:08 energy on the right and this is the
29:11 coupling constant multiplied that by
29:12 that matter energy here's the units and
29:15 it is what you get in terms of kilogram
29:16 per cubic meter it's on the area of turn
29:19 of the TV five kilogram per cubic meter
29:22 shows you that space is extremely stiff
29:25 space is extremely stiff the vacuum cpe
29:28 if you can add it all up would give you
29:31 something that where it's not within
29:33 that ballpark but it gets close and it
29:36 shows that I am NOT an energy that we
29:37 have access to cosmological is very weak
29:40 compared to that you would be to been a
29:42 space and of course up to the point in
29:44 that space is even stiffer and there's a
29:47 frame they are they are the reference
29:49 frames against which acceleration is
29:51 measured their forms are property of
29:53 space-time that is not fairly understood
29:55 everyone we have max Percival times 10 29:58 versions of knots principals out there
29:59 with their own ideas of how to explain
30:01 Yosha
30:02 our space-time is work by the presence
30:04 of mass energy viable Einstein equations
30:06 which is given here you see a ball of
30:09 matter is very better space around it in
30:11 the web machine that nice whether she
30:13 registration gravity this is the first
30:18 that we associated at the geometrical
30:20 craving of that space and that's what we
30:23 would call the mercial field gradient
30:24 generate so V also predicts my
30:26 administrative relative initial forms
30:29 and the facility of we're trading losses
30:30 and this is well
30:32 by general relativity is called the
30:33 interstate in fact or the gravitational
30:34 Faraday effect and unfortunately the
30:37 loss of gravity pull be there's no
30:40 successful measuring it because there
30:42 were problems with the highest
30:43 sensitivity Christian drivers that they
30:45 use they were just done there's a
30:47 problem there's technical problems they
30:49 could not verify the firm dragging
30:50 effect at all Montaigne there basically
30:53 is in Austria at the National Research
30:56 Center's it's now the asterisk to the
30:58 technology the trees he was looking at
31:00 rotating ways putting him in a cryogenic
31:04 Dewar are that could hear him and
31:06 putting the ring on a haven a motivator
31:09 and spinning them up a few hundred rpm
31:11 and basically he put accelerometers out
31:14 of armies and I began seeing an unusual
31:17 force
31:17 he began mopping the fearsome measuring
31:20 and discovered a what looked like that
31:23 we had a magnetic effect something
31:24 similar till they understand the fact
31:26 that with a very hard gravitational
31:28 coupling constant like about probably 18 31:32 meters or maybe ten or twelve orders of
31:34 magnitude larger than general seventy
31:35 would protect but it was rather high so
31:38 he developed a theory thinking that
31:39 possibly the superconducting states of
31:41 the letters in this liquid helium we're
31:44 covering with gravitational field
31:46 somehow and create an anomalous constant
31:49 value are very our firm driving force on
31:52 the outside of the system as turning on
31:55 he keeps our here enacted with our group
31:58 and he gave him a lot of input and he
32:00 took that input to redesign experiment
32:02 two or three times to measure he
32:04 graduated away from accelerometers and
32:06 into laser journals he even obtained the
32:08 laser gyros from about a used on Soviet
32:11 based of missiles which were highly
32:13 sensitive he reproduced the effect
32:15 either the coupling constant got smaller
32:17 and then he finally got to the point to
32:20 where he had to take the waves off who
32:23 can measure the fact just with the
32:25 holder then he took behave it off and I
32:28 was measured with some effect which is
32:30 to helium so the thing is
32:32 it's a bust he's still getting bad are
32:35 still measuring the force but there's no
32:36 Thea to explain it we have to spit this
32:39 this is jordyn closed chapter in a bit
32:41 looking at the quantum vacuum zero point
32:43 energies and the dynamical Casimir
32:45 effect you take the Casimir cavity but
32:47 you also have unbounded in the cavity
32:49 and there is a net force that's
32:51 generated in keeping with F equals MA
32:54 and the third law and you could push
32:57 against the vacuum fluctuations you
32:58 generate a really really thrust and it
33:02 is not quite measurably that I think
33:04 we're just on the verge of possibly
33:07 designing it explained to actually
33:08 measuring us in the near future
33:10 they are the thrust equations when it
33:13 design of fusion the robotics are has
33:15 been White team Glenn Research Center in
33:19 including looked at the possibility of
33:21 whether solid fusion could be a power
33:23 source it's it's not a it's not an
33:27 open-and-shut case yet sign of fusion
33:29 does exist and it does produce power but
33:32 it's basically on the chemical acoustic
33:35 system and it is not going to be any
33:38 breakthrough power at all it's not at
33:41 the very kind of energy to lead to a
33:42 breakthrough that we could that we could
33:44 depend on our curiosities as you guys
33:46 may have heard by now are voyagers and
33:49 pioneers as well as other spacecraft
33:51 that have been for the last few years
33:53 have been theory an additional sunsetted
33:58 attractive force on them and if there's
34:01 been at least anybody so basically
34:04 there's a real force of gravity acting
34:05 the systematic analysis of all these
34:08 forces measured by all the different
34:10 spacecraft are showing a demonstrable
34:13 force that's consistent is repeatable it
34:16 has the same elements however we don't
34:19 know what the source of it is and so
34:20 people are looking at alternative
34:21 theories of gravity I think that more
34:25 curiosities involving dark energy
34:29 the big bang on there are the things
34:34 that can these things will tell us these
34:37 things may tell us something about
34:38 space-time and vacuum energy that might
34:42 lead us to explore some names that could
34:45 ghosts and very propulsion here's what
34:49 the mysteries of physics would look like
34:51 as we covered them in our book and we
34:55 all interconnected to all these
34:56 different concepts and last max
35:01 particular challenge was as a man as a
35:04 NASA probe banana tree he was tasked
35:07 with having to beat down the skeptical
35:09 academics and there are incredible
35:11 scientists and visionaries who are all
35:13 the people who publish in peer review
35:16 for out-of-the-box thinkers be able to
35:18 come forward get some support to be able
35:20 study some of these interesting problems
35:22 so we looked at what whether they what
35:24 are the features that we want in a
35:26 visionary per year we want to combine
35:28 vision of credibility to consider the
35:30 possibilities research rigorously and
35:33 impartially a judge others River and
35:35 impartiality but not the feasibility
35:37 that's one important characteristics
35:39 you've got to have you want to do small
35:42 increments of progress if a little bit
35:43 less provocative so you know still
35:45 controversy emphasis on physical
35:47 observables and use appropriate
35:49 comparisons with energy for example in
35:52 space-time propulsion the key driver is
35:55 rocket efficiency or potential efficacy
35:57 is measured by the specific impulse you
35:59 cannot use specific impulse for world
36:01 drives or where events or applying
36:04 vacuum thrusts because it has no unit in
36:06 those genres but the specific impulse
36:07 comes out of the rocket equation which
36:09 is Newtonian physics so you've gotta
36:11 talk in terms of energy and then secant
36:14 apply qualified critiques by building in
36:16 also peer reviewers who are interested
36:18 in willing to to examine these things
36:21 look at the river and judge the their
36:26 effectiveness and whatnot
36:28 my concluding remarks I understand a
36:30 fault requires discoveries in physics
36:32 rather than just technological
36:33 refinements physics has advanced
36:35 sufficiently beware
36:37 research based our breakthroughs has
36:39 begun and it's been in progress since
36:42 the mid-1990s
36:43 even if desired breakthroughs are
36:45 impossible at least the path of this
36:47 study proves our provides novel
36:49 approaches scientific investigations to
36:51 continue looking into those curiosities
36:53 of nature and the cosmos like dark
36:55 energy dark matter and there's an
36:57 ominous forces acting on our spacecraft
36:59 but are far outside the solar system
37:01 and that the breakthroughs are formed
37:03 space flight and much more will be
37:04 revolutionized thank you very much and
37:17 we do have time for questions ok tell me
37:27 what his question was ok
37:31 Bobby good idea to use the microphone is
37:34 there any thought using the known
37:36 properties of UFOs as a guide to your
37:38 thinking and or such I'm still having
37:41 trouble hearing what's going on the
37:43 question is is there any asking ok is
37:48 there any application or wisdom to be
37:51 taken from UFO research that might help
37:54 you or the answer is yes enero secretly
37:58 also an overtly no because they the
38:03 mainstream academic still about the
38:05 topic of UFOs are you really having
38:07 credibility with them especially with
38:09 policymakers and decision makers in
38:11 charge of funding and programmatics
38:12 better than here the topic of UFOs so
38:15 for the purpose of doing this officially
38:16 without billionaire phones but we did
38:19 consider it under the table and yes
38:22 there is a subset of us we've looked at
38:25 UFO data and we've looked at all the
38:27 physical events and physical
38:30 descriptions that were provided by
38:31 investigators from shark Valley to
38:33 yourself and and whatnot and George
38:37 Hathaway and so forth and we've been
38:39 able to use that data as input to give
38:41 us an idea and that data does drive the
38:45 concepts that we did derive later on
38:47 that we were the brought the millions of
38:49 the original NASA program white whale
38:50 drives and wormholes for example at the
38:53 lives Utah launched that all right would
38:55 used to work for Bob bivolo for six
38:57 years we have the experience of a
39:01 scientist and the investigator seeing a
39:04 window that look like a rainbow open up
39:06 with the creature crawling through and
39:08 then the potential use that I actually
39:10 see eliminating the sky in broad
39:13 daylight with the travel of thought that
39:14 came through it well that's an example
39:16 of data about indicators around there
39:18 involved I mean our geometry tells you
39:22 that a man who looks like we intersect
39:24 surf space it appears as a very bright
39:27 intense intensity by way of light and
39:29 then as it was an intersection that's
39:31 larger larger then it opens up indicated
39:34 through the hole and things will be
39:36 billion out of it so that's a detail
39:37 appear to datasets that we've verified
39:39 that the day of Utah range that matched
39:42 well I know as a physicist or burglar
39:44 would do what was we haven't seen UFOs
39:49 do performances that adhere to the world
39:51 web because the web driver basically
39:54 it's just between stars that we don't
39:55 see EF is more beware
39:58 we see them doing related materials and
40:00 proclamations they disappear reappear
40:03 that's that's that one is undeterred yet
40:07 III would think the Ravens be
40:09 possibility still prepared effective
40:14 anything else and I think they're anti
40:16 gravity we have anti-gravity and
40:18 Einstein's true theory but although it's
40:20 overdue and I talked about in my chopper
40:22 you both in my three chapters there are
40:24 other aspects of anti-gravity the
40:27 properties of negative ocular energy
40:29 that will create a repressive force that
40:31 allows simply levitated up and he refers
40:33 to exhibit that so there's an how could
40:36 a scale as my vacuum model it's a
40:39 different fate of relativity where
40:41 instead of the space-time univision a
40:43 spacetime
40:44 as a paralyzed by vacuum of the 2008 40:47 fluctuations and if you observe a field
40:50 on that medium the fluctuations are
40:53 polarized that creates a spacetime been
40:56 in effect 72 will grab you one holes and
40:59 we say we see that we surround aspects
41:01 of what he put in cherry can take one or
41:03 two more quick questions here back there
41:10 I hate to continue the fear potent topic
41:16 of UFOs but I'm driven to ask if you
41:19 know the name Bob Lazar about what the
41:24 name Bob Lazar you don't know that name
41:27 he claims to have worked in the area 51 41:30 and to have worked with captured UFOs
41:33 and to have investigated the physics of
41:35 propulsion and he states that I believe
41:39 element 113 which is as-yet-undiscovered
41:41 on earth is an island of stability and
41:45 other
41:45 as unstable regions of nuclei and that
41:49 in element 113 the strong nuclear force
41:51 extends slightly behind the nucleus and
41:54 aliens have discovered a way to amplify
41:56 that force and use it to create
41:58 artificial wormholes for transport so I
42:03 know I'm sorry
42:04 this is hard to do shortly but that that
42:08 is one Avenue I think the wormhole idea
42:11 is the solution to this problem and that
42:12 is one bit of forbidden knowledge that
42:16 you might use in the future okay thank
42:19 you
42:19 thank you yeah these are actually to
42:22 question about the legitimate the end of
42:23 the table really have to be brief
42:28 how many of sky Nelson and my question
42:30 is you mentioned retroactive causation
42:33 as a means of communicating into the
42:35 past can you elaborate on how that would
42:38 impact space travel so how a retroactive
42:42 communication into the past could
42:44 actually influence space travel is there
42:45 some connection there that you were
42:46 making which part of being able to
42:48 operate how retroactive communication
42:52 where you just transfer your vision back
42:54 and forth you're just transferring
42:55 information does that actually I know
42:57 really well now and where there's a
42:59 thought that doesn't apply the space
43:01 travel that we don't know we've all
43:03 personally don't think so FTL
43:05 communications it's just going to need
43:06 FTL communications I don't think that I
43:10 put that on the side probably because he
43:13 won't believe that question will be to
43:14 be addressed and why well join
43:16 creaminess research is specifically for
43:19 a communication system and it doesn't
43:21 have any application for space travel
43:22 their table in your teleportation okay
43:25 again thank you very much

00:00 Translator: Hélène Vernet Reviewer: Tanya Cushman
00:07 Thank you very much. It's wonderful to be back in Brussels.
00:11 I have been given the challenge of discussing with you
00:16 the next 50 years of physics,
00:19 in a dark room without windows, an hour after lunch.
00:25 So, I already see some of you recoiling in horror
00:29 at the prospect of equations and tensor calculus.
00:34 I'm not going to do that.
00:37 I've called my presentation "A theory of everything (else)."
00:43 Professional physicists today
00:46 are developing various theories of everything
00:50 to try to reconcile the two major successful theories of physics today:
00:57 general relativity and quantum mechanics.
01:00 There are a couple of dirty little secrets in there that they are not telling you.
01:06 The first one is that these two theories,
01:08 which each of which works very well in its own domain,
01:13 are in violent contradiction in most of our world every day,
01:18 especially with gravity.
01:22 Therefore, the idea is to try to develop theories of everything
01:26 that would reconcile somehow - like string theory and others -
01:31 would reconcile these two dominant views of physics.
01:38 The other dirty little secret is that in all that,
01:43 we have left out a missing child.
01:47 The missing child is the little sister of physics.
01:52 It's the physics of information,
01:53 and that's what I would like to talk about this afternoon.
01:58 The physics they teach us in college and in universities
02:02 is the physics of energy.
02:04 It has to do with lasers and colors and particles and mass
02:09 and fields - whatever the field is -
02:12 and acceleration and inertia
02:14 and all these things that you've been exposed to
02:16 in high school or college or university.
02:21 The problem is that they also teach us
02:24 that information and energy are two sides of the same coin,
02:29 but they never bothered to teach us the physics of information;
02:33 they continue to teach us the physics of energy.
02:36 Now, going back to the 19th century,
02:38 James Maxwell,
02:40 discussing thermodynamics,
02:44 took a very simple idea
02:46 that if you pour hot liquid into a cold liquid,
02:50 there will be an average temperature of the liquid
02:53 between these two components.
02:57 The only way to stop that would be for a little demon,
03:00 Maxwell's demon,
03:01 to be there and to separate these molecules.
03:04 But absent this demon,
03:06 the law of thermodynamics will say the two liquids will mix
03:10 and will reach an average tepid temperature.
03:14 Leo Szilard, who was a colleague of Einstein, in 1929,
03:19 went one step further and said for the demon to be able to do this,
03:24 the demon needs information
03:26 about which molecules are hot and which molecules are cold.
03:31 If the demon knows that,
03:32 then the demon can, in fact, keep the two liquids separated,
03:36 and, well, they will never reach an average temperature.
03:40 But that means that there is just as much information
03:44 as there is energy in the system,
03:46 and that information and energy are, in fact, the two sides of the same coin.
03:52 So, where's the missing sister of physics?
03:56 Physics of energy has to do, again,
03:58 with particles and atoms and fundamental forces
04:01 and mass and entropy and fields
04:04 and space dimensions - X, Y and Z -
04:07 and T - for time -
04:09 and momentum and inertia and speed and so on ...
04:12 But we never talk about similar concepts on the side of the physics of information,
04:19 and my argument is that in the next 50 years, we will.
04:23 I should disclose to you ...
04:25 I'm in a field where everybody works on full disclosure,
04:28 so I may as well confess to you that I dropped out of physics.
04:32 I have an advanced degree in physics only because I was good in math,
04:39 so I could work out the equations and get the answer.
04:43 But then, I dropped out of it for a couple of reasons.
04:46 First, I could never understand what they meant
04:49 when they said time was a dimension.
04:52 They say, "Okay, there is X, Y and Z," so I get that from common experience.
04:56 And they say, "Think of time in the same way; only in the equation,
05:00 you put a little "I" in front of "T" for square root of minus 1 -
05:05 but don't think about that -
05:07 and then you treat it the same way, and everything works fine."
05:10 That's in general relativity and other areas of physics -
05:15 that's what you do.
05:17 I could never get that because in X, I can go this way or I can go that way.
05:23 In time, I cannot - I'm not allowed to do that.
05:25 So, we're very good at talking about how time passes;
05:30 we don't know why time passes.
05:33 Similarly, we're very good at talking about how things fall down;
05:37 we don't know why they fall down.
05:40 And again, this is not something you've been taught in physics in college.
05:44 They never said that they couldn't explain those two things.
05:48 The third thing that disgusted me was particles.
05:53 You know, we have particles inside the atoms,
05:56 and then, we have particles inside the particles;
05:58 we have particles inside electrons and photons and everything else.
06:03 And then, since it still doesn't quite work very well,
06:07 we have particles of sub-particles.
06:10 And that reminds me of something
06:11 that happened to astronomy in the Middle Ages,
06:14 when they had cycles and epicycles, and epicycles of epicycles.
06:19 If you keep doing that, everything works fine,
06:22 except that that's not the way reality works.
06:24 So I thought they should go on doing this;
06:27 they should go on with the physics of energy.
06:30 We achieve wonderful things with that science,
06:34 but that's not what I really want to do.
06:36 So I went back looking for the missing little sister of physics,
06:43 and it turns out it's asking fundamental questions
06:46 about the nature of time
06:49 and also about some of the things that happen in our lives,
06:52 like coincidences.
06:56 On July 20, 1996,
07:00 we had a house in the country, north of San Francisco,
07:03 a wonderful area full redwoods,
07:05 and we had some friends over on an evening, for dinner.
07:09 One of our friends was a woman
07:11 who said she was going to be in a play, in Mendocino County,
07:16 and in the play, she was going to read something in French.
07:20 She had not practiced French for a while,
07:24 so she asked us if we had a book in French,
07:27 and we had a bookshelf with English and French books.
07:30 So my wife pulled out a novel,
07:32 which was this novel by René Barjavel, "La peau de César,"
07:37 and she gave it to me, and I opened it at a random page.
07:42 I read a passage at random, which was
07:45 "I was in the Boeing that blew up after take-off at Kennedy Airport,
07:49 a bomb in the hold, 132 dead, remember?"
07:54 Well, this was three days after a Boeing took off from Kennedy Airport
08:00 and blew up over the Atlantic,
08:03 and we were shocked by this.
08:06 If you talk about this kind of coincidence with your friends,
08:10 you'll find that many people have, in fact, had that kind of experience.
08:15 This was not precognition;
08:16 this was three days after the TWA 800 accident.
08:22 But it shook us up and then we forgot it.
08:26 This is the kind of thing that you sort of brush out of your awareness.
08:32 Some scientists have thought deeply about this.
08:35 Going back to the Middle Ages, Facius Cardan, in the 15th century,
08:41 writes in his diary that he had performed some rites
08:47 to make the elementals of the air appear in his laboratory.
08:53 This was a very fashionable thing to do in the 15th century,
08:56 and these creatures appeared before him.
09:00 There were seven sylphs, the creatures of the air.
09:03 Two of them were the chiefs, and they came forward,
09:06 and he asked them what they knew about the nature of the universe.
09:09 It turned out the two sylphs disagreed.
09:13 One of them said,
09:14 "Well, God created the universe once and for all, and here we are."
09:19 The other one said, "No. God created the universe from moment to moment,
09:24 and if He should stop for a minute, everything would disappear."
09:28 So this clicker is not the clicker that I was given earlier.
09:33 It's another occasion, another instance of the same clicker,
09:38 but these clickers are being generated by something in a higher plane,
09:42 which as a software engineer, I understand perfectly; this makes sense.
09:47 It makes no sense in terms of the physics of energy;
09:50 it makes perfect sense in the physics of information,
09:53 and here you have the two models of the world.
09:56 You have the classic physical model, and you have quantum mechanics.
10:01 A number of people have more recently been looking
10:04 for the little sister of physics,
10:06 starting with Wolfgang Pauli, one of the founders of quantum mechanics,
10:10 Carl Jung - and there is extensive correspondence between Pauli and Jung -
10:16 Paul Kammerer, Arthur Koestler, David Bohm, Max Velmans,
10:19 Philippe Guillemant in France, Landauer and Seth Lloyd and many others.
10:26 Carl Jung argued with Pauli,
10:29 and Carl Jung compiled a catalog of coincidences that had happened to him.
10:36 In one case, he was at a conference in another city,
10:40 and in the middle of the night,
10:41 he woke up with a feeling there was somebody in the room.
10:45 He actually got up and checked, and there was nobody in the vicinity,
10:49 but he had the feeling of something hitting his forehead
10:52 and something hitting the back of his head.
10:55 He went back to sleep, and the next day he got a telegram
10:58 that one of his patients had committed suicide
11:00 by shooting himself in the forehead,
11:02 and the bullet had lodged itself in the back of the head.
11:05 Carl Jung, in his books, mentions a number of these remarkable coincidences.
11:13 I had another occasion like this.
11:16 In the 70's, I was concerned about the number of cults
11:22 growing up in California but also in France and elsewhere
11:26 around the idea of extraterrestrials.
11:30 Some of these groups call themselves the Melchizedek cult.
11:37 They use as inspiration the biblical figure of Melchizedek.
11:42 This is a representation of Melchizedek at Chartres Cathedral,
11:47 which is very beautiful.
11:48 Melchizedek is a very interesting, very mystical,
11:53 very mysterious figure in the Bible.
11:58 He is a very powerful figure because he initiated Abraham
12:02 and actually was the origin of all three religions of the book:
12:07 the Islamist, the Jewish and the Christian religion.
12:13 I was going to an interview in Los Angeles,
12:15 took a taxi at random from the flow of traffic,
12:18 got to my interview.
12:21 When I got home, I looked at the receipt from the driver,
12:25 and the receipt was signed Melchizedek.
12:28 Now, that got me
12:32 on a strange series of thoughts.
12:37 At the time,
12:38 there was research going on at Stanford Research Institute,
12:40 on parapsychology.
12:41 I was part of that program, the program of remote viewing.
12:46 Uri Geller was there.
12:47 Uri Geller thought that he could communicate with extraterrestrials
12:51 on board a platform called "Hoover,"
12:55 and that he was getting communications from them,
12:58 which enabled him to do what he was performing in our laboratory.
13:05 I thought, "Well, this seems to be the same kind of communication.
13:09 Something is communicating with me."
13:12 Over the next several weeks, I did a number of experiments,
13:16 and I convinced myself that these coincidences,
13:21 some of them mean something powerful, as Jung said.
13:24 Others mean absolutely nothing.
13:27 It's just the way the world is organized.
13:31 So let's go back and do a little bit of software thinking.
13:35 If you have a small library ...
13:37 This is the Library of Congress, 33 million books.
13:41 Thirty-three million books is nothing.
13:43 I mean, that's what Facebook does in one afternoon.
13:47 Today, Google is getting 35 hours of video per minute
13:51 uploaded to the YouTube site.
13:55 So, if you have a small library, you can still work with coordinates.
13:59 You have shelves, and you have vertical stacks,
14:02 and so you have X, Y and Z, and that works fine.
14:05 If somebody sends you 10,000 books,
14:07 you can push the existing books a little to insert the new books.
14:10 If you have enough staff people at your disposal, it works fine.
14:15 If you have a modern library which looks like this -
14:19 this is Google, Facebook, Twitter -
14:22 you can't do that anymore, you can't use dimensions.
14:25 You sprinkle the information that comes in, statistically,
14:29 in virtual memory, in an infinite virtual memory.
14:32 Then you have a hashing code
14:36 that enables you to get it back when somebody asks a question out to Google.
14:42 The result is statistical.
14:44 Some of it means something; some of it means nothing.
14:50 This is now starting to be mainstream physics.
14:54 Dr. Guillemant in France is a CNRS physicist,
14:58 and in his latest book, "La route du temps" - "The Road of Time" -
15:02 he argues that synchronicities are caused by a double causality:
15:06 our intentions cause effects in the future
15:09 that become the future causes of present effects.
15:13 Again, this is now becoming mainstream physics.
15:16 To conclude, there are four requirements for the new physics of 2061.
15:23 First, we should recognize the universe
15:26 as a sub-system of a mental reality of information structures.
15:30 It's all information structure, and it's all simultaneous.
15:35 I don't mean it's a database.
15:37 I don't mean to use analogs with current, crude technology.
15:41 It's something obviously much bigger, much more complex, but you get the idea.
15:47 We should recognize dimensions as a cultural artifact.
15:50 We create dimensions
15:52 because we have small libraries and we need X, Y and Z.
15:56 But we don't need them in physics,
15:58 so we should do away with the concept of dimensions
16:02 in the physics of the future.
16:05 The present is over-determined.
16:07 As Guillemant says,
16:08 it is determined from the past and it is determined from the future.
16:12 And finally, consciousness is generating the impression of space and time.
16:18 That's what space-time is.
16:20 It is consciousness traversing associations in this world of information
16:25 and creating the illusion of space and time.
16:29 So, my proposal to you
16:31 is that we let physicists continue with the physics of energy.
16:35 They do that very well and will eventually have a way
16:38 of reconciling relativity with quantum mechanics.
16:42 Let's go on and look for the missing sister.
16:45 Thank you very much.
16:47 (Applause) 

==========lVkTuFf2QsU==========

00:13 okay well dr. Eric Davis birth tech
00:16 right that's just to prevent any
00:18 fanastic oh okay okay which is this you
00:21 know you you could say both of mine well
00:23 can you tell me what you're presenting
00:24 about this year well actually I'm
00:27 presenting three papers and two papers
00:31 as a first author and one paper as a
00:33 co-op the first of my two papers is
00:37 first author one of them is I'm
00:39 reviewing on experimental concepts for
00:41 studying ways to extract energy from the
00:44 quantum vacuum and it's basically
00:46 summary of subscribe and concepts that
00:49 we've been exploring and we're going to
00:51 be doing in the laboratory to seep it
00:52 and extract energy from the ceramic
00:54 luxuriate we'll also put a little
00:56 background history on the cell point
00:58 fluctuations what it is physically it's
01:00 numerical magnitudes and consequences if
01:03 we can extract such energy for
01:05 applications and commercial spaceflight
01:07 commercial power systems and so forth
01:11 the other paper I'm offering is on a
01:14 review of laboratory concepts for
01:16 extracting negative energy for
01:18 generating negative energy in the
01:19 laboratory that would be used for
01:21 generating FTL space times and like
01:24 traversal wormholes or Alcubierre warp
01:26 drive or krasnikov
01:28 - or pipes or whatever the idea is to
01:31 look at the definition of negative
01:34 energy so that people who are not
01:36 specialists in general Tiffany can
01:37 understand what it really means
01:39 the term is miss applied in Miss years
01:41 so much that everybody gets confused and
01:43 don't know what they're talking about
01:44 usually so I'm going to clear that out
01:46 by describing
01:47 give its physical definition and then
01:51 examine the background of the kinds of
01:53 effects in quantum theory where negative
01:55 energy can be is known to be generated
01:58 and then I'm gonna look at some selected
02:01 concepts that have been developed that
02:03 could hopefully produce negative energy
02:05 in the laboratory by the way implants
02:07 quantum optics techniques the other
02:09 paper is a paper joint with Harold white
02:12 from NASA Johnson Space Center he's
02:14 doing this as a probably so still not as
02:16 announced employee as part of it as
02:18 graduate thesis workforce PhD in general
02:21 to me it's on examining alcubierre's
02:24 warp-drive in higher dimensional space
02:25 times using deep brain theory and we
02:28 show that in deep brain theory you can
02:30 actually eliminate the negative energy
02:32 requirement and replace it with the
02:34 positive energy and a negative pressure
02:35 well this isn't really that will be a
02:37 breakthrough paper right because this is
02:39 the listener from where I've seen this
02:40 is the first time we've ever seen an
02:42 applied physics approach to string a
02:44 brain through your writing so that I
02:46 mean that's a real hallmark achievement
02:48 right and the idea is we believe that
02:50 the ocular metric for any kind of work
02:51 metric it really represents a velocity
02:54 boost that goes off the brain that we
02:56 live on into the higher dimension of
02:58 space and the equation of state of
03:01 matter energy that you need to affect
03:03 that facility would give you a
03:05 requirement for positive energy and
03:07 negative pressure so not
03:08 I get excited tomato sauce equation
03:11 statements light
03:13 mention stating in the universe and so
03:15 somehow Harold had proposed a first
03:20 order that were rough sketch lab
03:22 experiment that we could do using lasers
03:25 in order to try and see if we can test
03:27 this theory oh okay so there we go
03:29 we'll see do you think there's more of a
03:31 future out there than for brain theory
03:32 because you know a lot of people have
03:34 questioned that in terms of well
03:35 sprinkler mostly because it can use this
03:37 whoo you guys are using this so does
03:39 that now that the door isn't closed on
03:41 brain area because it hasn't been
03:42 disproved whenever you do experiments
03:46 you try to falsify in theory in order to
03:48 prove it that's the way you prove there
03:49 you just try to falsify you can't
03:50 falsify it you've proved it literally
03:52 this is just one way of being able to
03:55 test some aspect of d-brane theory that
03:57 we think work and lab to create an FTL
04:01 space-time like the alchemy work so this
04:03 would be almost clearly the Star Trek
04:05 what five five yeah in a way but this
04:07 would be low level that isn't going to
04:08 be dramatic it's not gonna you're not
04:10 gonna expect to see anything
04:11 disappearing in the laboratory and
04:12 zipping off to the nearest star it'll be
04:15 a low level low energy experiment that
04:19 will give us an idea of what direction
04:20 we're taking what we're doing like what
04:22 we're doing wrong what we could do
04:23 better
04:24 it'll be an exploration of this thing to
04:26 see how right it is if it doesn't work
04:28 it doesn't mean it's not right it just
04:30 means we don't have the right
04:31 experimental concept we would have to go
04:33 back to the drawing board
04:34 try to reanalyze everything and see what
04:36 experimental devices what configuration
04:38 of energies lasers fields what it what
04:41 not would be more appropriate to make
04:43 this happen you know if this
04:46 configuration that Harald is proposing
04:49 doesn't work then we need to find other
04:51 configurations that will make it work
04:52 and if it doesn't work at all
04:54 it might call into question whether
04:55 banker even works or not well now on
04:57 your badge I should be focusing on your
04:59 badge at this it also says that you're a
05:01 chairman right with speaker and a
05:02 charity so so in terms of section out
05:04 can you tell me what the papers that
05:06 you're you're revealing it or I can't
05:08 hear you tell I'm sorry you reviewed
05:10 some of the papers as well right you're
05:11 right for other people you try me what
05:13 about those or I no no the ideas I just
05:17 did a peer review on the papers to see
05:19 that they reached a level of publication
05:23 quality required by state and scientific
05:26 quality required by more scientific
05:28 standards to publish their papers I got
05:32 rejected because they might because the
05:35 idea is not bad the author's just don't
05:38 know how to write a paper you can get
05:40 them to come around then there were
05:41 papers that were rejected probably from
05:43 almost a combination of both reasons
05:45 usually the ideas are really bad
05:47 I'm not provable based on hearsay and
05:50 not on the scientific not that they have
05:51 no logical coherent flow of information
05:53 could could make you believe that it
05:56 even the idea works or what not so
05:58 papers did get rejected there wasn't a
06:00 lot of paper through a minority of
06:03 papers got rejected in the vast majority
06:04 got a so there is also a limit to how
06:06 many we can handle because we're all out
06:08 for papers per session and we were given
06:10 eight sessions we have the largest
06:12 number of sessions in this conference
06:13 issue so I know that some papers that
06:16 did get rejected only because the paper
06:18 writing quality was bad
06:19 they're gonna be loud oral presentation
06:22 so they're gonna be here providing an
06:24 oral talk on their on their paper
06:26 oh but didn't difference betwee it
06:27 doesn't go to be a there won't be in the
06:29 proceedings but they have it in the
06:31 abstract book and they will make an
06:33 appearance at the FOH session Thursday
06:35 morning and so those are the papers had
06:38 only got the check because for one razor
06:40 to the other the author was not able to
06:41 spend the time to bring it into the
06:43 right format oh sure and and amid there
06:46 might even be some that has questionable
06:48 information on it we allowed it in
06:51 folder the benefit that there's an
06:53 ominous information in there that might
06:54 benefit you know future direction
06:56 there's another one also that have the
06:58 economics of high frequency gravity labs
07:00 and now in terms of state I guess it
07:02 makes sense wasn't very scientific as
07:04 well the business case but it would be
07:06 interesting you know they're they're
07:07 rumors I guess Paul Miran is talking
07:09 about putting together - see graduate
07:11 conference firm maybe mid summer or 2007 07:14 sometimes so I wonder if those might
07:15 might qualify some the things that
07:17 didn't quite devastate know those kind
07:20 of things do sit with state because
07:21 staff is about propulsion power and
07:24 anything that can affect advances
07:26 increases in propulsion power for space
07:28 and space commercial applications is
07:30 acceptable if you're looking at high
07:32 frequency gravity waves you might find
07:34 ways of improving space communications
07:36 you might find ways of modifying gravity
07:38 locally to enhance your space propulsion
07:41 you can use high-frequency gravity waves
07:43 from weapons applications you can use
07:44 high frequency graduate graduate a
07:46 number of applications yeah Oh
07:48 astronomer basically cosmology and
07:50 astrophysics and astronomy you can use
07:54 high frequency gravity waves for a
07:55 number of things and the economics of it
07:58 is a paper I think that was presented
08:00 last year I don't know if they're gonna
08:01 like that they don't okay okay well that
08:04 pertains to if you have a high frequency
08:06 welding wave based technology in the way
08:09 of a communication system that's
08:11 superior to all the relay satellites we
08:13 have now it's a direct line of sight
08:15 through the earth communication system
08:17 what's the economic benefit of that over
08:20 a traditional system how much more
08:22 difficult or expensive will be to feel
08:23 that to develop it and so forth you
08:25 presume the technology the physics is
08:28 right that the technology is there it's
08:29 just that you want to look at how
08:31 advantageous is it to use that as
08:33 opposed to standard high frequency
08:35 microwaves or even direct line-of-sight
08:37 laser beam communication well given all
08:39 these applications you have any thoughts
08:40 for funders who might be might be
08:42 watching down the road and get this on
08:43 the web in terms of what they might
08:46 consider putting their money into and
08:47 and if they should wait perhaps or years
08:49 or this is a good time to invest and
08:52 it's the directions that they might go
08:53 in terms invest well I think the funders
08:56 should look at these state proceedings
08:59 in the eff sessions particularly since
09:01 we represent the new frontiers and
09:03 future concepts if you're looking at new
09:05 frontiers and future concepts is
09:06 something you want to put your might
09:07 answer
09:08 and look at the paper proceedings read
09:10 every one of them carefully and decide
09:11 which topic that was published there
09:14 that you liked the most that you would
09:16 like to see developed AG and you might
09:19 also want to look at the previous two
09:20 symposiums in this year is the third
09:22 symposium of new frontiers and future
09:24 concepts we also had the previous second
09:26 and first symposiums which was last year
09:29 was the second and the year before was
09:31 the first thing you want to look at the
09:32 proceedings from there to in the F
09:34 sessions and those symposiums and see
09:37 and decide for yourself whether
09:38 something there is what you like to do I
09:40 think high frequency gravity wave
09:41 gravity modification faster life space
09:46 times like rules and drives those are
09:49 all valid concepts you should put you
09:50 can put money into also power concepts
09:52 like extracting energy from the vacuum
09:54 or exotic no one has ever thought about
09:57 type ideas involving electromagnetic
10:01 well in terms of in terms of the lab now
10:03 you mentioned upcoming experiment I know
10:05 earth tech in the past or Institute for
10:07 Advanced Studies has done all sorts of
10:09 stuff porn for a few sir there's a great
10:10 fun trophies are online but apparently
10:12 Hal and Michael agus in it built that's
10:14 on the website but but one things that
10:16 I've kind of wondering that it's the
10:17 timeline for these experiments began I
10:20 mean in terms of transporting you know
10:22 even a small particle of matter you know
10:24 through some kind of a wormhole device
10:26 you think that we have gotten the
10:27 horizon in the near future or do you
10:29 think that's some of your lifestyle are
10:32 you talking about actually implementing
10:34 it or just it will even even yeah even a
10:37 test case just just kind of fell we
10:39 don't know we don't know yet I mean
10:41 essentially a standard traversable
10:42 wormhole Theory has no we've analyzed
10:44 there's no such thing and if it's a
10:46 stationary run most it's not a time
10:48 machine one so those those those things
10:51 are not considerations in this case oh
10:53 okay okay there's there's very specific
10:55 specific difficult ways of turning
10:57 hormone
10:58 machine and worrying about horizons and
11:00 going backwards and so forth and so on
11:02 those those require extreme movement of
11:05 the wormhole went into the wormhole as
11:07 compared to the other in order to dock
11:08 to effect time dilation and things like
11:11 that
11:12 nobody's gender stationary wormhole it's
11:14 just going to open up and connect to
11:16 different regions and across space
11:18 together and that's it you go when you
11:20 come out yeah do you think it's nothing
11:23 any more difficult than what what's been
11:25 described by Morrison thorn or now this
11:27 room is Maghreb yeah but that's a very
11:28 stable very sane very exciting difficult
11:38 event I mean in a lab environment you
11:41 know given you know even even for a
11:43 small woman sighs do you think it's
11:44 possible transport matter like the next
11:46 few years given correct technology I
11:47 don't know I oh not with no not given
11:49 current technology we're not ever that
11:50 we don't have the magnitudes of the
11:52 negative energy in order to generate a
11:54 wormhole that realizable I think what
11:56 we're gonna do is look at Micra wormhole
11:59 development in the lab we did we can
12:00 maybe Corral just enough negative energy
12:02 over just a small enough period of time
12:04 now we can see some kind of a measurable
12:06 in fact that's it's only baby steps
12:08 right now you know the technology is not
12:10 first of all we don't have the
12:12 technology to to generate enough
12:14 negative energy we don't have a way of
12:16 measuring it in lab yet we don't have a
12:18 way of concentrating it in a place where
12:21 you can then start shaping it into a
12:23 wormhole we don't have that one yeah
12:25 we're just getting started now with
12:27 concepts of generating negative energy
12:29 thinking about it implementing the first
12:31 steps in the laboratory and then
12:33 evolving that technology forward to
12:35 where we can then start worrying about
12:36 the rest of it well but but once it does
12:39 start release oh I mean as far as I was
12:41 going to answer your question all as far
12:42 as in the future it's going to be
12:45 thirty years or more I don't know you
12:47 know that's just a pessimistic view the
12:51 technology accelerates and advances in a
12:53 sudden abrupt changes here we go over
12:54 here in here and there so you never can
12:56 predict when things increase in time or
12:58 decrease in time
12:59 oh so I just say you know 30 years from
13:03 now might be you might be possibly
13:05 looking at being able to send create a
13:07 little small wormhole in the lab and
13:09 send it beam a particle straight but
13:11 that's the best I think we can do given
13:13 you know the unlikely event fact or the
13:19 low probability event that some
13:20 breakthrough happens if we can make even
13:22 more negative energy yeah absolutely
13:24 yeah well thanks again for your time
13:26 okay dr. Eric Davis from Institute of
13:30 Advanced Studies 


==========5V7eoBUplv4==========

00:00 uh what einstein said is relativity
00:02 theory requires that
00:03 all events no matter where they're
00:05 located in in the universe
00:07 all observers like you guys sitting in
00:08 your chairs no matter where you're
00:09 located
00:10 in the universe or in this ballroom for
00:12 example you all have
00:14 a causal light cone attached to you and
00:17 right now you're sitting at the now
00:18 that's
00:19 the observer sitting right now uh in
00:21 this event
00:22 now and this is the observer's
00:24 hyperspace
00:25 of now and that hyperspace is
00:27 three-dimensional space that we live in
00:29 and the time
00:30 axis the time direction is vertically up
00:32 this way and space is horizontally
00:34 perpendicular to the two light to the
00:36 two cones right there
00:38 okay so let's look at this chart just to
00:39 begin with okay so
00:41 uh well let me let me yeah i'm going to
00:42 go ahead and start with here so
00:43 basically your causal structure of your
00:45 past your present your future is laid
00:46 out in what's called the light cone
00:48 all of your past activities your past
00:51 motion
00:52 your past trips wherever you went
00:54 because you cannot reach or exceed the
00:56 speed of light
00:57 your past events of everywhere you've
00:59 been is always within side
01:02 the past light cones so your entire past
01:04 is kept within this light cone here
01:06 and then your move up to the present
01:08 time right now where you're sitting in
01:09 your chairs watching me speak
01:11 and you're right here and then
01:13 everywhere you're going to go from this
01:14 point on after
01:15 after i speak now and then after i give
01:17 my speech and going forward into the
01:18 future
01:19 you're going to be limited to motion and
01:20 time and space within the future light
01:22 cone
01:23 so your motion is on a line called the
01:26 world line the world means the entire
01:28 history of your life
01:29 and that's a world line and we call that
01:31 a time-like world line
01:32 because it goes in the time direction
01:34 remember time is vertical
01:36 goes up that way and all three
01:37 directions of space that you live in is
01:39 this way
01:40 okay so this is a world line a time like
01:42 world line of all the events that you've
01:44 ever done in the past
01:45 what's happening to you now and what
01:47 will ever happen to you in the future
01:49 now why they call that a light cone is
01:51 because you notice this is the cone
01:52 that's swept out
01:53 well let's look at this diagram because
01:55 a lot less confusing
01:56 time is this way space is that way and
01:59 all 45 degree angles
02:01 with respect to the time and space axis
02:03 is the surface of the cone and the only
02:05 things in the universe that
02:06 live on that surface are light rays
02:08 electromagnetic radiation
02:10 hence light cone so lycone represents
02:13 the surface
02:14 of which all light rays everywhere in
02:15 the universe lives on that surface right
02:17 here on that blue shaded surface
02:19 light moves on that on that diagonal
02:22 line on that surface and that's called
02:23 the light-like
02:24 world line okay so einstein said we set
02:27 up a cause and effect
02:28 causality uh attached to your light cone
02:31 of past
02:32 present and future and therefore you
02:34 have what's allowed
02:35 uh all of the different alignments of
02:37 the light cones the like cones of every
02:39 observer everywhere in space and time
02:41 are all aligned in the same direction
02:43 they have to point in the same direction
02:45 so you notice how the time axis is
02:47 always vertical and the space direction
02:49 is always perpendicular
02:50 okay so this observer this observer
02:52 these observers here
02:53 they all are lined up in the same
02:55 direction no matter where they're
02:56 located
02:56 now here's three observers or three
02:58 events and they are legally connected up
03:01 along a time-like world line
03:02 so that this observer can see this guy
03:04 this guy can see this guy
03:06 and so this is an allowed motion through
03:08 space time you are allowed to travel
03:10 through space time on such a motion as
03:12 long as you follow an aligned light cone
03:14 path like that
03:16 now the perpendicular direction in the
03:18 space axis
03:19 is forbidden that is because i said
03:21 everything that moves at the speed of
03:23 light lies on that surface
03:25 but what's outside here is forbidden
03:27 that's the surf that's the spatial
03:29 region
03:29 where things go faster in light and it
03:31 is forbidden to go outside in this
03:33 region and go faster and light you can't
03:34 do it
03:35 because of einstein's universal speed
03:37 limit restriction
03:38 okay so that's what special relativity
03:40 gave us
03:42 well then in 1915 general relativity
03:44 comes along
03:45 there were problems with newton's law of
03:47 gravity newton's law was failing at the
03:49 end of the 19th century
03:50 it was making wrong predictions about a
03:52 number of astronomical things that
03:53 astronomers were observing
03:54 and they were saying oh i make all these
03:56 calculations of what i'm observing
03:58 observing using newton's laws and
04:00 kepler's laws of motion and they're
04:01 wrong
04:02 they were right for most of the planets
04:04 but now all of a sudden we're seeing
04:05 some wrong stuff
04:06 and einstein went back to the drawing
04:08 board he said okay maybe i can figure
04:10 something out
04:10 special relativity was a theory of
04:12 constant motion constant
04:14 velocity or relative rest he did not
04:17 include
04:17 forces or accelerations and that's the
04:20 difference so einstein went back to the
04:21 drawing board with relativity theory and
04:23 he said
04:23 what happens if i include forces and
04:26 acceleration in space time well
04:28 a big startling thing happens you warp
04:30 space
04:32 you basically come up you basically end
04:33 up replacing news laws of motion
04:36 and gravity uh all forces and
04:38 accelerations are replaced by
04:39 curve or warped space-time geometry
04:42 picture space time again as a flat
04:45 surface
04:45 but it's more like a stiff rubber sheet
04:48 you put a heavy ball in it or bowling
04:50 ball or a
04:51 lead ball in it or even the planet earth
04:53 right there and
04:54 that heavy mass will bend the space time
04:57 around it
04:58 and you see that bending right there see
05:01 the space is flat out here but the earth
05:02 is rotating around
05:04 and it's bending space in because of its
05:06 big mass and because the earth rotates
05:08 it's also dragging it
05:09 think of space time is like a rubbery
05:10 sheet molasses so when you have a
05:12 rotating
05:13 star planet or galaxy that rotation
05:15 causes space to drag around it that's
05:17 called frame dragging
05:18 so that's what einstein discovered what
05:20 you think is a force
05:21 what you feel is an acceleration in your
05:24 car or in a plane
05:25 or in your motion is not a real force
05:27 and it's not a real acceleration instead
05:30 it's curvature this curvature this is
05:32 the gravity that holds you on the planet
05:34 earth there's this curvature right there
05:35 that's what einstein discovered and
05:37 what's wonderful is it has special
05:39 relativity theory already built in
05:41 uh it's very well tested and here's the
05:43 beauty of it
05:44 because space can be curved guess what
05:45 einstein discovered the light cones of
05:47 causality are not universally fixed for
05:50 all observers
05:51 some light cones can be tilted over with
05:53 respect to other light cones in warp
05:55 spaces
05:56 and so here's an example of the tilde so
05:58 here's the time axis
06:00 here's the space axis this is the space
06:02 of forbidden motion remember
06:04 this is the hyperspace that all of your
06:05 three-dimensional space is in and your
06:07 present is right there at the point
06:09 in between the two cones the past and
06:11 the future
06:12 and now curved space i'm gonna i'm just
06:15 gonna
06:15 bend i'm gonna bend space with some kind
06:17 of fictitious mass you can't see it here
06:19 it doesn't matter
06:20 but i'm bending space along these arrows
06:21 that's what this means base is curved
06:23 around like that
06:24 so this observer here is going to
06:26 observe this guy right there and there's
06:27 this guy
06:29 right there at that point and do you
06:30 notice that his light cone is tilted
06:32 over
06:32 it's really cool his lycone is tilted
06:34 over and you notice his time direction
06:36 is that way
06:37 his space direction is that way but
06:39 relative to this guy
06:40 this guy is almost moving at the speed
06:42 of light
06:43 his position is such that this guy here
06:45 is looking at him and he's tilted almost
06:47 45 degrees and remember anything that's
06:48 at
06:49 roughly 45 degrees is moving at the
06:51 speed of light now take a look at this
06:52 guy
06:53 this guy is so tilted over his future is
06:55 pointed that way
06:57 his past is right here it goes that way
06:59 and his forbidden space region is this
07:00 way
07:01 but look at this guy this guy is looking
07:03 at this guy this
07:04 first person right here is looking at
07:06 that event or that person right there
07:08 and he says wait a minute his timeline
07:10 direction
07:11 his time-like world line is pointing in
07:13 the forbidden direction
07:15 that way that means he's going faster
07:17 than light
07:18 but wait a minute is he violating
07:20 einstein's slight speed limit no
07:22 because this guy's time axis is that way
07:25 his time-like world line is moving
07:27 within the light cone
07:28 he's not violating light speed in his
07:30 reference frame
07:32 in his reference frame he is moving
07:34 within the light cone
07:35 he is moving less than the speed of
07:36 light but this guy says
07:38 oh that guy's moving faster than light
07:40 because remember the light cone is
07:42 tilted with respect to that one and this
07:43 one is another one where it's tilted
07:45 almost in a 45 degree angle this guy's
07:47 future is going that way his past is
07:49 that way
07:50 so this guy sees him as going wait a
07:52 minute wait a minute this guy's future
07:54 is up that way right
07:55 this guy's future is down that way oh
07:57 this guy's going backwards in time
07:59 he's in a time machine he's going
08:00 backwards with respect to this guy
08:02 this guy is also going backwards with
08:04 respect to that guy see this guy's
08:05 future is that way
08:07 his past is that way now he's moving in
08:09 a time-like direction right
08:10 you see it's vertical with respect to
08:12 him so they're aligned
08:13 their time-like directions are aligned
08:15 but the future is down for this one
08:17 and the past is up and this guy is going
08:19 kind of almost uh
08:20 going faster in light so that's how you
08:22 go faster than light without going
08:24 faster than light
08:25 you can break the light speed barrier
08:27 but relatively relative
08:29 to other observers who are not in a in a
08:32 curved space time okay so now you've got
08:36 the tools you need to understand warp
08:38 drives and wormholes
08:40 okay einstein's general theory predicts
08:42 two types of faster than light space
08:44 warps that give us that effect that i
08:45 showed you
08:46 of the curved space and the tilting
08:47 light cones first one is traversable
08:50 wormholes
08:50 which were discovered by kip thorne and
08:52 his postdocs and grad students in 1985 08:54 to 88 at cal tech
08:56 and warp drives discovered as a solution
08:58 einstein's theory of relativity
09:00 by miguel accubir who was then at the
09:03 university of spain i can't remember now
09:05 portugal maybe
09:07 okay i want to show you a little math
09:10 not because i'm going to
09:11 melt your brains here but i just wanted
09:12 to give you an idea of what these things
09:13 look like
09:14 that's einstein's general theory of
09:16 relativity the field equations for curve
09:18 space time
09:19 this object here is called the energy
09:21 momentum or stress energy tensor
09:23 that encodes the material properties of
09:26 matter like the earth
09:27 you chair atoms suns and galaxies
09:31 so you put matter here this is the
09:33 matter
09:34 that's going to bend space and that's
09:36 the einstein curvature tensor
09:38 this is the quantity that measures the
09:39 warping or bending of space
09:41 remember what i said about working i
09:42 don't have a piece of paper but just
09:43 take a piece of paper and bend it that's
09:44 warping okay i'm using that word
09:46 synonymously with
09:47 curving and bending so warping or
09:49 space-time curvature is represented
09:51 there
09:52 uh this is the coupling constant that's
09:53 newton's uh constant of gravity the
09:55 universal
09:56 gravitational constant and that's the
09:58 speed of light to the fourth power eight
09:59 pi
10:00 eight times pi times g over c to the
10:02 fourth power anyway
10:03 that looks like an elegant simple
10:04 equation it's really not it's ten
10:06 non-linear partial differential
10:07 equations with symmetry conditions and
10:09 boundary conditions
10:10 it's a nasty mathematical mass but it's
10:12 a lot of algebra so
10:13 here's what einstein's general theory
10:15 says you put a source of matter into
10:17 space
10:18 here and output comes curves
10:21 matter curve space and curved space
10:24 tells matter how to move through curved
10:26 space
10:26 okay oh i didn't talk about the last
10:29 thing okay
10:30 einstein's general relativity says for
10:32 faster and light space time geometries
10:34 you know to give you the
10:35 the space geometry of curvature that you
10:37 need to make a wormhole or warp drive
10:39 requires a type of matter that's exotic
10:42 it's not like the
10:43 type of normal matter that we're all
10:44 made out of and it turns out
10:46 it's exotic because it violates some
10:49 heavy duty mathematical conditions that
10:51 stephen hawking invented back in the 70s
10:53 we don't need to get into that and the
10:54 type of exotic matter is
10:56 negative vacuum energy no problem we've
10:58 got negative vacuum energy
11:00 anything that has a negative energy
11:01 density or negative energy flux
11:03 is predicted by quantum field theory and
11:05 it's observed in nature
11:07 okay
11:10 okay that's the taxonomy of traversable
11:13 wormholes
11:14 so these are the type of traversable
11:15 wormholes that you can have
11:18 and this is how they connect up with
11:20 things in space you'll have connections
11:22 through space
11:23 time and universes you have different
11:25 throats
11:26 wormholes can have a variety of
11:28 different throat shapes like those
11:30 things here
11:30 and then wormholes can also be time
11:32 machines warp drives
11:34 well warp drives you have the alka
11:36 bear's original expansion contraction of
11:38 space
11:39 then there's vandenbroke who modified
11:40 alcubierre's warp drive to lower
11:42 the energy requirement i'll talk about
11:44 that briefly and then there's not
11:45 tyrio's word driving ontario
11:47 did have a different ward drive and i'll
11:48 explain that when i get to alcabear's
11:50 warp drive
11:51 and then here are the alternate
11:52 alternate uh quantum gravity models of
11:54 warp drive
11:55 sunny white at nasa and myself have a
11:57 have a extra space dimensional warp
11:59 drive
12:00 and then there's one by richard abusi
12:01 who uses kasmir energy and extra space
12:04 dimensions to fuel a warp drive
12:06 and then hal put off and myself and
12:08 claudia macony have the polarizable
12:09 vacuum model and i'm not going to get
12:11 into a lot of those because that's
12:12 pretty heavy duty stuff um this is the
12:14 basic premise of occupier's wardrobe
12:16 here's the starship
12:17 the space-time grid is flat here around
12:19 the starship
12:20 he feels no forces and no acceleration
12:22 no curvature no curvature
12:24 so he's going to feel the bubble of
12:25 negative energy some sort of negative
12:28 vacuum energy
12:29 and that bubble is going to contract all
12:31 the space
12:32 going out to the destination star light
12:34 years away and it's going to push back
12:36 all the space
12:37 behind him to push the earth farther
12:39 away and that's how you're able to go
12:41 faster than light without going faster
12:42 than light
12:43 this guy's not moving he's sitting in
12:45 flat space at relative rest he isn't
12:47 moving
12:47 and doing anything it's the warping of
12:49 space here and here
12:50 that's moving him is like a surfer on a
12:53 surf and the uh wave of the surf is
12:55 carrying him toward the beach
12:56 faster than light whereas if he was
12:58 swimming through the water he'd be
12:59 limited to the speed of light and he'd
13:01 be spending a lot of energy kicking his
13:02 arms and legs trying to swim to the
13:03 beach
13:04 we're here the surf on the wave is going
13:06 to be pushing faster than light
13:07 so that's how that works and here's
13:11 another representation for the occupier
13:12 ward drive here space is flat there's no
13:14 curvature here's your starship
13:16 this represents the volume of space
13:18 that's collapsed
13:20 from your location to your destination
13:22 star this represents the volume of space
13:25 from you to your departure planet like
13:28 earth will be there that you're pushing
13:29 away from you
13:30 and that's what that represents
13:33 a traversable wormhole this is called
13:34 the flam diagram and what it shows you
13:37 is
13:37 regular space time right here right
13:40 there and here's point a
13:42 and here's point b and a light ray is
13:44 going to move at the speed of light
13:45 departing from point a and it's going to
13:46 have to go all the way through normal
13:49 space
13:49 time to get to point e point b i'm sorry
13:52 that's going to take a heck of a long
13:53 time because remember space is so big
13:54 that light speed is slow
13:56 so if distances are measured in light
13:58 years it's going to take light years
13:59 you know years for light to reach those
14:01 well traversable wormhole says let's
14:03 take negative vacuum energy
14:04 and let's create a shell of it around a
14:06 location open up a throat push space
14:09 open to form a throat
14:10 and thus you have the throat of the
14:11 wormhole and instead of going this way
14:14 you're going to go through the wormhole
14:15 and it's a it's like a hyperspace tunnel
14:17 a shortcut from point a to point b and
14:19 you bypasses all this distance and all
14:21 the years you have to travel
14:23 instead this could be a matter of a few
14:24 days or a few seconds of trip time
14:26 and you've effectively moved faster in
14:28 light you might put on a rocket on your
14:30 back
14:30 or you might walk through here at 30 14:32 miles an hour and you will have
14:33 traversed
14:34 this entire 10 light year distance in a
14:36 matter of a few days or a few seconds
14:38 so even though the guy going through the
14:40 wormhole did not go faster than light he
14:42 didn't reach the speed of light he's
14:43 just walking through or he's got a
14:44 rocket backpack pushing him through
14:46 he's going to be going at a slow speed
14:48 but to everybody out here
14:49 everybody out here they're looking at
14:51 this motion occurring and they're going
14:52 to measure him with their clock saying
14:54 wait a minute he just jumped 10 light
14:55 years in a matter of days or hours
14:57 so he went faster in light from their
14:59 viewpoint that's because the like cones
15:00 are tilled in
15:01 with respect to here and here so this is
15:04 what a spherical wormhole looks like
15:06 if that's the sun in the background and
15:07 a throat is opened up there's a negative
15:09 energy
15:10 shell around here you would see a galaxy
15:12 shrunken and distorted it's inverted
15:14 you'd be looking through it's like a mag
15:15 it's like an inverse magnifying glass
15:17 here's a star gate opened up in times
15:20 square this represents the stargate
15:21 solution where the
15:22 where the wormhole is not spherical it's
15:24 got a flat door-like opening
15:27 and here's another version of the flat
15:28 door like opening there
15:30 and uh that's that's the uh the stargate
15:34 solution what it means is the negative
15:35 energy
15:36 the negative pressures and stress are
15:37 all zero
15:40 in that particular case all right so i
15:42 talked about negative energy so what are
15:44 the negative energies well here's the
15:45 taxonomy of exotic matter
15:47 according to nature and quantum field
15:48 theory
15:50 so there are all the forms of negative
15:52 energy and this is really heavy duty
15:53 physics
15:54 here so i won't get into a lot of it but
15:55 let me just say that the yellow
15:57 objects here that are identified in
15:59 yellow those are observed in the lab or
16:01 we see it in nature somewhere
16:02 or it is expected to occur but it's not
16:04 yet observable
16:05 but it has measurable consequences that
16:07 you can observe so these are the types
16:09 of
16:10 negative vacuum energy or exotic matter
16:12 that we have in nature
16:14 and uh here's the casmir vacuum energy
16:16 associated with the cashmere effect
16:18 and here are the ones that we also
16:19 realize anything in red is uh
16:21 is fictional it's a theoretical
16:22 speculation
16:24 all right now to talk about how much
16:27 energy does it take to power these
16:28 things compared to
16:29 all the propellant you have to put in a
16:31 space shuttle to move it to
16:33 alpha centauri or all the propellant to
16:34 move into an anti-matter rocket or
16:36 fusion rocket
16:37 we've got to look at the reality of what
16:38 the energy requirements of warp drives
16:40 and wormholes are
16:41 this word total is a mistake that's a
16:43 error i didn't catch in time this should
16:44 say
16:45 net negative energy to produce a
16:47 spherical traversable wormhole
16:49 our throat is the diameter of the radius
16:51 you can take your choice
16:52 the energy of the wormhole is negative
16:53 remember i said it's negative 10 to the
16:55 44th
16:56 times the radius of the wormhole throat
16:58 or the diameter of the throat
17:00 that's nasty and that doesn't make it
17:02 look as real as as much better as an
17:03 anti-matter rocket or a fusion rocket
17:06 now for a warp drive it turns out that
17:08 is the total energy
17:09 the total energy the total negative
17:10 energy to produce a warp drive is going
17:12 to be given by the
17:13 warp speed of the bubble you know it's
17:15 surrounded by a bubble
17:16 and that bubble has a dimensionless warp
17:18 speed it's a it's a fraction of the
17:19 speed of light
17:20 like work one warp two ward three so
17:22 forth r is the radius of the warp bubble
17:24 and
17:24 sigma is the inverse of the bubble wall
17:27 thickness so that's the negative energy
17:28 negative 10 to the 44th times the square
17:31 of the warp speed times the square
17:33 of the radius of the bubble times the
17:35 inverse thickness of the
17:36 bubble wall that's nasty that's a lot of
17:38 negative energy there and i'm going to
17:40 show you some numbers
17:41 general relativity constrains warp speed
17:43 to be less than or equal to this number
17:45 given here
17:46 uh m ship is the mass of the starship
17:48 delta is the thickness of the wart
17:49 bubble wall
17:50 and r is the radius of the wart bubble
17:52 wall of the word bubble
17:54 uh it just says that the n and there's a
17:55 condition that the net total energy
17:57 stored in the abort bubble
17:58 cannot be greater than that contained in
18:00 the starship itself that's to maintain
18:02 energy conservation
18:04 okay so here's the bonfire the realities
18:07 now i'm going to take those negative
18:09 energies of a wormhole and divide it by
18:11 the speed of light squared that'll give
18:12 me an equivalent negative mass
18:14 i want to use an equivalent mass to show
18:16 you the comparison
18:18 of how bad this the magnitude of this
18:20 negative energy really is
18:21 for a warp for a wormhole of a radius of
18:24 1000 meters
18:25 you're going to need negative 710 times
18:27 jupiter's mass
18:29 equivalent remember the inner it's
18:30 really energy but i turned it into mass
18:32 units
18:32 for a wormhole of 10 meters diameters
18:35 it's negative 7 times jupiter's mass
18:37 and for 1 100th of a meter 0.01 meters
18:40 your wormhole energy requirement is
18:42 going to be negative 23 times
18:44 earth's mass so here's jupiter's mass in
18:47 kilograms
18:48 earth's mouth and kilograms and this is
18:49 really ugly
18:51 warp drives okay well it's even bad for
18:53 warp drives here's the wart bubble speed
18:55 the speed
18:56 at which the warp drive is relatively
18:58 moving with respect to non-moving
18:59 observers
19:00 so you've got warp what is it 10 to the
19:02 negative 5 10 to the negative four
19:04 0.01 warp 0.5 warp warp 1 warp 2 warp 10 19:08 and warp 100 those are fractions
19:09 those are multiples of the speed of
19:10 light take a look at the energy
19:12 requirement
19:13 look at the size of those numbers
19:14 negative all those are negative of
19:16 course
19:16 and look at the power on the 10 and
19:18 compare it with the positive
19:19 mass energy density uh the total mass
19:23 energy of the sun in joules that's in
19:24 jewel units this is pretty bad
19:27 so what do we do well there's some
19:29 options
19:30 and i didn't mention one thing about
19:32 wormholes
19:34 reason why i said that was net energy
19:35 not total is because the total energy of
19:38 a wormhole can be positive
19:40 zero or negative depending upon how it's
19:42 constructed
19:43 and i showed you an example of a zero
19:44 energy wormhole that's the stargate
19:46 solution
19:46 okay so there's some alternatives we
19:49 have my colleague in
19:51 in longview texas richard abusi got his
19:53 phd at baylor on this
19:54 you use negative cashmere vacuum energy
19:56 in extra space dimensions this comes
19:57 from superstring theory
19:59 and it turns out that if you apply that
20:00 to a warp drive you can get the
20:02 energy down to negative the equivalent
20:05 negative
20:06 mass of jupiter and that's a lot lower
20:08 that's about the size of a wormhole
20:10 of a wormhole energy requirement however
20:12 these guys found that
20:13 richard and his colleagues found that
20:15 there's going to be a maximum quantum
20:16 speed limit
20:17 for warp drives it'll be 10 to the 32 20:19 times the speed of light that's
20:20 one followed by 32 zeros times the speed
20:23 of light
20:23 but for all intents and purposes that's
20:25 pretty huge that's pretty big
20:26 harold white that's sunny white my
20:28 colleague at nasa uh
20:30 we found a way both of us i gave him
20:31 this idea to do the study
20:33 and he looked at taking the warp bubble
20:35 and pulsing it
20:36 at high frequency so that you can lower
20:39 the energy demand on average
20:40 and you crunch all your energy into a
20:42 peak pulse width
20:44 spaced out in very short time intervals
20:46 that's what we do in directed energy
20:47 weapons that's how you create
20:48 high-powered laser weapons
20:50 a laser like this is powered by
20:51 batteries this thing won't be able to
20:53 produce megawatt power but i could
20:54 produce megawatts of peak power
20:56 if it's pulsed up to megawatts and the
20:58 average taken over time
20:59 is going to be very low energy so uh so
21:02 he did an analysis of doing such a thing
21:04 he uh he did high frequency pulsing of
21:06 the word bubble he shrank the thickness
21:08 of the warp i'm sorry he increased the
21:10 warp bubble wall and he made it thicker
21:12 and the result is is that the energy of
21:14 the warp is much smaller
21:16 and what's the equivalent mass of that
21:17 energy he found out that you could get
21:19 it down to roughly
21:20 negative 722 kilograms that's something
21:24 we can engineer
21:25 so we finally have a warp bubble uh
21:27 energy requirement that's engineerable
21:30 and doable it's practicable so this is
21:32 pretty promising and this is where we're
21:34 where he and i are doing our research
21:36 right now to move forward
21:37 all right so we're talking about
21:38 producing negative vacuum energy
21:41 okay there are a variety of different
21:42 ways of producing negative vacuum energy
21:44 and i'm only going to just review them
21:45 quickly this is called squeezed light
21:47 and it's a special form of light from a
21:49 laser beam and you put it through a
21:50 lithium niobate crystal and there's
21:52 other kind of crystals you can use
21:53 and what it has the effect of is
21:55 producing alternating pulses the red
21:57 pulses of positive energy
21:59 and the yellow pulses they're the
22:00 alternating pulses of negative energy
22:02 and if you have some kind of a fast
22:03 rotating mirror you can separate out the
22:05 positive pulses
22:06 and the negative pulses and concentrate
22:08 the negative pulses right here and that
22:09 would be what you'd use to build your
22:11 wormhole work right with
22:12 another way would be a series of enough
22:14 not three but a whole bunch of these
22:16 photon emitters and you'll combine all
22:18 of their photons into a manifestly
22:20 negative pulse of energy in a beam
22:22 and that's just a device that does the
22:23 switching we can't realize
22:25 rotating mirrors like this this mirror
22:26 has to rotate once every 10 to the
22:28 negative 15 seconds
22:29 but with the sodium gas cell we can
22:31 rotate we can do an effective mechanical
22:33 rotation electrodynamically here in the
22:35 gas cell
22:36 uh much faster than that so this is how
22:38 you would uh implement a rotating mirror
22:41 the casimir effect two plates like a
22:44 capacitor plates block out the outside
22:46 vacuum fluctuations
22:47 in the quantum vacuum and what's left is
22:50 a reduced
22:51 state energy inside the plates and here
22:54 that energy happens to be negative
22:55 and it's very weak it's not usable but
22:58 it exists in nature
22:59 and we we truly routinely make these
23:01 laps this is a mirror
23:03 and if you take a mirror and you
23:04 accelerate it rapidly through space
23:06 it will it will excite the quantum
23:08 vacuum fluctuation and create a flux of
23:10 negative energy
23:11 a beam of negative energy will be
23:12 emanating from in front of its motion
23:16 and the best one that we've identified
23:18 in the last four years
23:19 is a parabolic cylindrical mirror just
23:21 like these that are used for solar
23:22 thermal energy
23:23 converters uh the idea is that you put
23:26 this in the vacuum of space
23:27 and it's going to focus all of the
23:29 vacuum fluctuations that strike the
23:31 mirror
23:31 they're going to focus along the focal
23:32 line of the mirror and larry ford at
23:35 tufts university
23:36 did a calculation with his colleagues
23:37 fader and they figured out that the
23:40 energy of the vacuum fluctuations that
23:42 collects on that focal line
23:43 is negative and not only is it negative
23:45 it's astronomically negative
23:47 i had my student in georgia tech do a
23:49 calculation of a micron size
23:50 a a mirror the size of the width of my
23:52 hair and we produced like
23:54 negative 10 to the 30th joules per cubic
23:57 meter one cubic meter of space contained
23:59 negative 10 to the 30th joules so we
24:01 think we've got the way of producing
24:03 warp drives and wormholes now
24:04 so this would be the way to do it these
24:06 processes are going to be weak and
24:07 difficult to implement
24:08 this is really the the negative energy
24:10 you get out of this is too weak to
24:11 matter
24:13 okay if you're going to build a warp
24:15 drive in a wormhole you need to be able
24:16 to detect the negative energy it's like
24:18 all radio engineers and light engineers
24:20 you have devices that detect the light
24:22 tells you how intense and bright it is
24:24 what its wavelength is
24:25 or you have radio detectors radio
24:27 receivers that'll tell you
24:28 fm or am radio signals what the
24:30 broadband wavelength is and blah blah
24:32 okay well we got to have that for
24:34 negative energy and we implement that
24:36 using what's called a balanced homodyne
24:37 detector
24:38 which were invented in the early 80s for
24:40 the purpose of measuring
24:42 the states of non-classical light i'm
24:44 just going to say basically it's
24:46 remember that previous graph of that
24:48 previous thing i showed you squeezed
24:49 light
24:50 okay well the balanced hominin detector
24:52 was was specifically invented to measure
24:54 this
24:54 to see the alternating pulses of
24:56 negative and positive energy
24:58 and in fact there it is there's the raw
25:00 data that was measured in the early 80s
25:01 the positive
25:02 and the negative energy is in that
25:04 little valley right there positive
25:05 negative energy positive and so forth
25:08 and uh this is called
25:09 quantum tomography it's like a cat scan
25:11 tomography or posit uh
25:13 positron electron tomography that
25:14 medical doctors use to scan
25:16 slices of your body tissue to hunt for
25:18 tumors and damaged
25:19 tissues and uh so tomography can see
25:22 this
25:23 this is a squeezed vacuum state there's
25:24 the positive energy there and the
25:26 negative energy is this way
25:29 well the next thing that has not been
25:31 done yet is doing a quantum tomography
25:33 of the negative energy inside of a
25:35 casmir cavity
25:36 and that's what i'm working on with my
25:37 co-workers at earth tech now
25:39 the idea is to put two miniaturized
25:41 nanoscale photodiodes inside of a
25:43 cavity about a millimeter on each side
25:46 on each plate
25:47 and the plates are separated by one
25:48 micrometer the width of my hair
25:50 and i want to make a measurement of the
25:52 negative energy and that's what it will
25:54 look like this is the computer model
25:55 simulation
25:56 of the actual of this version this is a
25:58 modified version of that i'm not going
25:59 to be able to implement this for this
26:01 because they're two different systems so
26:02 i'm going to have a version of this here
26:04 and what it's going to give me is this
26:06 and these colored regions
26:08 represent where the uh mathematics
26:11 breaks down right there at stationary
26:12 modes inside the
26:14 cavity and we're not going to be
26:14 expected to see anything but the
26:16 negative energy is going to be observed
26:17 here
26:17 if you if you insert the nanoprobes
26:20 inside the cavity
26:21 this is how much the nanoprobes will
26:23 disturb the transverse electric mode
26:25 inside the cavity
26:26 now that looks like a lot but it's not
26:27 it's only point four percent disturbance
26:29 so
26:30 that's good that's actually what we want
26:33 okay i'm getting close to finishing
26:36 this is the toughest problem that we
26:37 have yet and i'm not there yet i'm not
26:39 i'm still dealing with detecting
26:40 negative energy
26:42 and making negative energy producing it
26:44 and detecting it
26:45 we're nowhere near this how do we
26:47 construct a wormhole
26:48 we don't know how i mean einstein's
26:50 general theory of relativity
26:52 that equation i showed you doesn't tell
26:54 you how to do engineering
26:55 it just tells you how it just says if
26:57 you want a designer space time
26:59 you want to design curvature and warps
27:02 then it'll tell you what kind of matter
27:03 you need on that right hand side that t
27:05 tensor
27:06 okay and we know what that is but it
27:08 doesn't tell you how to
27:09 implement it using technology that's the
27:11 problem it tells you how to predict this
27:12 stuff but you don't know how to build it
27:14 so we can only speculate maybe just take
27:16 a a frame like this
27:17 of ford fader mirrors maybe this is a
27:20 line of parabolic mirrors all along here
27:22 and they're shooting negative energy
27:24 down to create the spherical throw to
27:25 the wormhole
27:26 and a spaceship just goes through that
27:27 opening and goes right into the wormhole
27:30 or maybe you might have an array of
27:31 forged fader mirrors like this
27:33 and the negative energy is pulled off
27:35 the focal lines and they all concentrate
27:37 at that little point there and the
27:38 rocket's gonna have to go into that
27:39 little hole in the middle
27:40 see the idea remember is we gotta thread
27:42 a throat with negative energy in order
27:44 to push space out
27:46 stretch it out hold it open and make
27:48 that hyperspace shortcut so that you can
27:50 dive into it come out the other side
27:52 see that's that's just a fictional
27:53 diagram of what it looks like in two
27:55 dimensions
27:56 okay that's what a slime diagram looks
27:58 like warp drives again that's even more
28:00 speculative you know that's the star
28:01 trek uh warp drive engine
28:03 from uh the next generation
28:05 unfortunately we don't know how to do
28:06 that we probably are gonna have to do
28:08 something similar to this with the
28:09 ford's vader mirrors
28:11 okay so let's assume we we've already
28:14 got
28:14 uh our wardrobe generator our bubble
28:17 negative energy generator our detectors
28:19 our engineers have detectors they can
28:21 see the negative energy so they can
28:22 locate it
28:23 shape it position it in the right places
28:25 and we're all good and swell
28:27 all right and now we can build the warp
28:28 drive now what happens when you're gonna
28:30 start flying when you start flying
28:33 you've got a couple pictures you've got
28:34 the
28:35 observer's view you guys are all the
28:37 astronomers on the planet earth you're
28:38 looking up in your telescope you're
28:40 looking up at the milky way at the night
28:41 sky
28:41 and all of a sudden you see this crazy
28:43 thing all of a sudden your view is
28:45 pinched off like this
28:46 and then this transition thing goes by
28:49 you
28:50 as it moves and you see this distortion
28:52 as
28:53 this thing is transiting across your
28:54 field of view and then as it moves away
28:56 from you you see that well that's what a
28:58 warp drive looks like
28:59 through your telescope so that's what
29:01 you would expect to see as an astronomer
29:03 if you're sitting in your starship this
29:05 is what you're going to see through your
29:06 uh
29:07 through your forward view window and
29:09 your rear view window
29:10 and this is when you're at stop you see
29:12 the stars here and the stars there
29:14 forward and after your front and back
29:16 windows
29:16 now if you're moving at 10 times the
29:18 light speed you notice how the stars now
29:20 collapse down to
29:21 those regions and then if you're moving
29:23 at 100 times light speed
29:25 the stars are now bundled up into little
29:26 balls uh they're blue for
29:28 the blue doppler shifting going forward
29:30 and the red doppler shifting
29:31 going backwards away from you
29:35 for traversable wormholes if you're
29:36 inside that throat this is what you're
29:38 going to see
29:39 you can't navigate that this there's
29:40 nothing to navigate with here you're
29:42 going to have all this distorted light
29:43 that's all going to be shoved around and
29:45 distorted by the negative energy
29:46 that's holding up the throat negative
29:48 energy is gravitationally repulsive
29:50 see where all of us are made out of
29:51 positive energy like this the atoms in
29:53 our bodies and the floor and whatnot
29:55 that's gravitationally attractive
29:56 that's why the moon the positive mass of
29:58 the moon and the positive mass of
30:00 the earth are gravitationally attracting
30:02 but negative energy
30:03 is repulsive it pushes things away so
30:05 light gets just pushed away into these
30:07 distorted
30:08 uh shapes here okay
30:11 well we've come to the conclusion so uh
30:14 what do i have left to do i've given you
30:16 the grand tour
30:17 and right now uh earth tech which is my
30:20 employer
30:20 we're looking at the critical technology
30:22 issues and we've started an experimental
30:24 program to produce negative vacuum
30:26 energy in large amounts
30:27 and what's important is the scalability
30:30 of present technologies can we scale up
30:32 negative energy
30:33 generators that i showed you up to large
30:35 sizes can we explore new ways
30:38 to produce it are there other methods to
30:40 produce negative energy other than the
30:41 ford's fader mirror
30:42 can we scale those methods up uh and
30:44 then we're going to look at the ford's
30:46 fader mirror itself the parabolic
30:47 cylindrical mirror and maybe even new
30:49 advanced laser photonics
30:50 to maybe find new ways to increase the
30:53 amount of negative energy that a pulsed
30:54 laser can produce
30:55 uh detecting negative vacuum energy
30:57 that's pretty much what i described was
30:58 the balanced tomato detector in a
31:00 casimir cavity
31:01 that has not been done yet after all
31:03 these decades since 1981 when ibm first
31:05 developed the balanced homage detector
31:07 no one has measured the negative energy
31:09 in a casimir cavity
31:10 so i'm the guy who's going to do it i
31:12 didn't predict it a colleague of mine
31:14 who's a german
31:15 i'm sorry he's a polish physicist he's a
31:16 post-doc at the university
31:18 of duesberg essen in uh disbert germany
31:21 and uh he published two peer-reviewed
31:23 papers describing the balanced tone body
31:25 detector needed to do a cosmic cavity
31:27 experiment
31:27 and i'm collaborating with him i brought
31:29 him out to texas and he visited us with
31:31 us
31:32 over the fourth of july holiday in 2011 31:34 and we are working on building his
31:36 experiment to test it
31:37 the next thing is to gain new insights
31:39 by simulating ftl space warps one
31:40 thing's
31:41 is i told you about einstein's general
31:43 theory of relativity the that's 11 31:45 non-linear partial differential
31:46 equations and the math is a
31:48 so you the best thing we've learned how
31:50 to do this stuff is you can't do it by
31:51 hand anymore
31:52 the calculations get could take years
31:55 doing it manually
31:56 the best thing to do is use
31:56 supercomputer computer simulation
31:58 modeling
31:59 throw this stuff into computer uh
32:01 numerical algorithms and simulation
32:03 modeling for visualization
32:04 and there are packages available now
32:06 that were invented by physicists
32:08 and published in the peer review in the
32:09 last couple of years and those packages
32:11 do exactly that
32:12 they've they've devised these packages
32:14 for the purpose of looking at what
32:15 happens when matter falls in the black
32:16 holes
32:17 how a black hole forms during stellar
32:19 collapse what happens when you go on the
32:20 inside of the event horizon of a black
32:22 hole
32:22 and the production of gravitational
32:24 waves from a black hole as matter falls
32:26 into it
32:26 so that package is actually the kind of
32:28 package we need and we've got that
32:30 package
32:30 and one of the next things we're going
32:32 to do probably about two years from now
32:33 is begin
32:34 a high-powered super computer numerical
32:37 algorithm
32:37 simulations to do visualization of how a
32:40 work looks when you try to build it
32:42 and the last important thing is
32:45 lab experiments using what's called
32:47 simulation or analog gravity
32:50 it's where you can do gravity on the
32:52 tabletop
32:53 in a laboratory using electromagnetic
32:55 radiation and what you're using
32:56 are meta materials you're going to use
32:59 metamaterials to reshape
33:01 light and you're going to reshape light
33:03 in ways that will reproduce the effects
33:05 of a warp drive
33:06 or a wormhole they've already been doing
33:08 similar effects like that with sound
33:09 waves to study black holes
33:11 and they're also doing that with light
33:12 waves now to study black holes
33:14 using a simulated experiment instead
33:16 you're going to create space time in the
33:18 lab
33:18 and you're going to bend that space time
33:20 only that space time is not real space
33:21 time it's electromagnetic radiation
33:23 electromagnetic radiation can be treated
33:25 like a space time
33:26 it can be curved and manipulated and
33:28 bent like a space time so you can get it
33:30 to behave like a black hole
33:31 or the planet earth or a rotating mass
33:33 or a warp drive in a wormhole
33:35 and so you use that you use
33:37 metamaterials
33:38 to shape the space of electromagnetic
33:40 light electromagnetic radiation going
33:42 around the metamaterial to create the
33:44 effect of ward rise wormholes
33:46 and um that is
33:49 pretty much the whole thing i think
33:53 so is this going to be our future that's
33:55 the question
33:57 thank you
34:10 [Music]
34:32 just
34:34 [Music]
34:59 you

00:02 this video was shot at physicists how
00:05 put offs Institute for Advanced Studies
00:08 at Austin I'm the senior research
00:11 physicist here and my doctorates in
00:14 astrophysics and my background is in
00:17 quantum field theory and general
00:18 relativity and I apply those fields to
00:21 an applied physics research area that I
00:24 specialize in called breakthrough
00:26 propulsion physics and it's about the
00:28 physics of propulsion for interstellar
00:30 flight and the breakthrough means we're
00:33 trying to go beyond the means or beyond
00:36 the limitations of Newtonian rocket
00:38 propulsion physics which has limited us
00:41 to speed limited us to how much we can
00:44 fly into space and instead try to find
00:47 ways to go faster into space reach you
00:50 know go further faster out into deep
00:52 space even reaching the nearby stars as
00:54 well as the outer solar system and it
00:58 also entails Studies on whether we can
01:01 break the Lightspeed barrier or not
01:03 using the current laws of physics dr.
01:06 Paul Smith persuaded his good friend dr.
01:09 Davis to come in on a Saturday to speak
01:11 with me because Paul knew that I was in
01:15 Austin to speak with physicists to see
01:18 if they knew anything about physicists
01:20 Tom Campbell's digital virtual reality
01:23 theory so I started by showing dr. Davis
01:29 animations to illustrate a controversial
01:33 area of Campbell's theory which you can
01:37 see in detail on the quantum physics
01:39 page of all reality comm dr. Davis
01:44 basically said that if some of the
01:46 physicists I had spoken to on the
01:49 previous day disagreed with Campbell
01:53 then perhaps Campbell had misunderstood
01:55 something but being a good scientist dr.
01:59 Davis said that he didn't really know
02:01 that much about the questions at hand
02:04 and so it didn't feel like he could
02:06 really speak to them but that was fine
02:10 because the discussion quickly led into
02:14 unknown territory
02:16 for me a non-scientist that were so
02:21 fascinating that I just sat back and
02:23 enjoyed the ride and I invite you to do
02:27 the same as dr. Davis starts the journey
02:30 by talking about physicists in Austria
02:33 working on something called the Bell
02:35 theorem or the Bell violation they have
02:41 finally done the last experiment to
02:43 close the loophole on the Bell
02:44 violations at Bell's Theorem violations
02:47 and because there's been a series of
02:49 things that have been laid out for
02:51 decades that well you have a week
02:53 experiment that'll that'll prove they're
02:56 built bells they're in violation then
02:58 you have gradually stronger experiments
03:00 but then there's all these other
03:01 experiments we came up with and the list
03:03 is finite it's not infinite which you
03:06 know which could possibly win when
03:09 performed could possibly show that
03:11 Bell's Theorem is actually obeyed and
03:14 there is no quantum entanglement so they
03:16 what about one had been demolished yeah
03:25 it's just I'm not an expert in that area
03:28 that's not gonna feel if you violate
03:31 Bell's Theorem you have quantum
03:33 entanglement in other words Bell's
03:34 Theorem ok Bell's Theorem house to do
03:36 with the correlation of quantum systems
03:38 and in a classical correlation where
03:42 there's causal interactions in time and
03:44 space between interacting systems the
03:48 theorem would be obeyed ok if the
03:52 interactions are a causal in other words
03:54 there's something fast there's an
03:56 influence going faster than right across
03:58 time and space then the theorem is
04:00 violated and the correlation is not
04:02 classical it is now falling into the
04:05 quantum domain ok so so they have mocked
04:09 every one of these things down for the
04:10 last 27 plus years and they just got to
04:13 the last way something because there's
04:15 always some little fidgety thing that
04:17 somebody comes up with that's like a
04:19 little backdoor little angle or a hitch
04:21 that could bring the whole thing down in
04:23 favor belts they're being obeyed and
04:29 yeah and that's right
04:32 and they and so they have to be tested
04:37 because it's a hypothesis that's been
04:39 put out there and it's the duty of the
04:41 scientists to take on I thought this is
04:43 tested in order to find out whether that
04:45 part of quantum theory stands or Falls
04:48 and they sure enough it not only
04:51 violated Bell's Theorem it maximally
04:53 violated boss they're so classical
04:56 physics is wrong and I mean there was
04:58 another article just a couple years last
04:59 year showing that quantum entanglement
05:02 is not a quantum phenomena it is they
05:07 have proven it to be a macroscopic scale
05:09 they see it out over centimeter scales
05:12 they see it over meter scales they're
05:14 seeing in over up to temperatures of a
05:16 thousand Kelvin high pressures I mean
05:19 all of a sudden we're going from these
05:20 little fragile quantum states of
05:22 molecules and atoms and whatnot or even
05:25 photons and they have to be quiet they
05:28 have to be cryogenically cooled can have
05:30 any thermal jittery from background
05:32 heater or a booster provided vibrations
05:35 and they have to be quantum system has
05:37 to be a photon or molecule or them and
05:39 here we're finding blocks and crystals
05:41 and macroscopic scale objects that are
05:45 actually exhibiting the effects of
05:47 quantum entanglement oh it's I have to
05:51 dig it out to find it it's a whole bunch
05:53 of things primary here's one primary way
05:56 the process of photosynthesis converting
05:59 solar energy into was is it sugars in
06:03 the in the plant that the plant consumes
06:06 okay well anyway it's the process of
06:08 photosynthesis photosynthesis had never
06:10 actually amazingly now as well as the
06:14 photosynthesis theory work it was still
06:16 not a close theory when physicists
06:20 looked at it in detail they found out
06:22 that the energy conversion process was
06:25 inefficient and it did in other words
06:27 the physics prediction of how it work
06:29 didn't match the high efficiency see
06:33 experiment gotta be specific everything
06:35 classical physics explanation yeah
06:37 that's so that this is biochemical
06:40 that's what it is it's a chemical
06:42 explanation so the chemistry
06:44 photosynthesis predicts that sunlight
06:47 comes in you're going to have all these
06:49 chemical reactions going on and you're
06:51 going to have energy come out into the
06:52 biology of the plant you know it's
06:55 whatever energizes the plant right it's
06:57 getting energy out of it the web okay
06:59 well they found out that the efficiency
07:01 is bad
07:02 it's so bad that there's a gap in the
07:04 energy conversion and they and all of a
07:06 sudden it's like wait a minute
07:07 this theory has been so well understood
07:09 so locked down how is it that this gap
07:11 has been existing all this time and we
07:14 didn't realize it chemistry should have
07:15 been able to biochemistry should have
07:17 been able to clean this up you don't
07:19 even have that biochemistry just
07:20 straight up organic chemistry is like
07:22 hitting the surface of the cell you got
07:24 the basic sugars and whatever and things
07:28 going on
07:29 I want come some physicists who took a
07:32 look at this and I don't know the
07:34 motivation involved but what happened is
07:36 they decided to they discovered that it
07:38 was quantum entanglement that solved the
07:40 problem
07:40 there's quantum entanglement going on in
07:43 the reaction that keeps outdoors life on
07:47 Earth yeah and it turns out that that
07:49 quantum entanglement was necessary to
07:52 close the efficiency and energy
07:54 conversion gap and it closed it
07:57 perfectly so another week and but can't
08:00 convert sunlight into cell energy
08:02 without entanglement so essentially no
08:09 that was a miracle quantum entanglement
08:19 is necessary for photosynthesis to
08:21 completely work properly so let's let's
08:37 forget about the delayed choice thing
08:39 and let me ask you
08:42 I started to say earlier one of the
08:45 reasons that I heard thought when I
08:50 heard Campbell stuff is that he might be
08:54 onto something with its digital vr
08:55 physics because it gives the only
08:59 explanation I've ever heard from any
09:01 physicist why light in a certain case is
09:10 a maximum I mean has a finite speed
09:14 night yeah has a finite speed infinity
09:25 is a maximum speed classically
09:29 so the and I've never heard you know
09:32 I've heard all the explanations of how
09:34 do you prove that it's it has the value
09:37 there but why I've never heard until
09:40 this digital VR explanation which is the
09:45 digital VR saying that basically we're
09:48 living in a simulated reality that's
09:50 it's digital it acts the same way it's
09:55 analogous to digital virtual reality
09:58 games like The Matrix yeah server
10:05 serving that reality on a constant time
10:09 loop and it's rendering that reality of
10:13 a T and on your computer screen your
10:19 resolution is to tell me about how many
10:21 pixels you've got and so on well the
10:23 digital VR physics explanation of the
10:26 nature of this reality is that it
10:28 operates similarly so that with each
10:31 delta T we get a render of this reality
10:35 and the resolution is determined by the
10:37 Planck length which I know what a
10:40 determinate determines a planked cube
10:42 that's that's analogous to a pixel on
10:45 them
10:45 and because the delta T is so fast that
10:50 we get our new rerender and we tend to
10:53 the minus 43 seconds that even the
10:56 faster you know a jet airplane or
10:58 whatever is going to take millions of
11:00 renders yeah before it's leading edge is
11:03 gonna hit the next yeah cute but light
11:08 is so fast with every render of a frame
11:12 of reality its leading edge is hitting
11:15 the next point cute it's always the next
11:17 point cute it's going so fast but it
11:20 can't go any faster than that unless
11:22 it's gonna skip Planck cubes in a render
11:24 and move that with the teleportation you
11:29 know teleportation well if you're
11:31 skipping Planck you how're do you want
11:33 to say it's we understand that light is
11:37 moving constantly through space so that
11:40 it's it's can't have its speed added to
11:45 it it's not okay there's something we
11:50 have experiments that have already
11:52 demonstrated that there are no point
11:54 cubes unfortunately they have been
11:55 looking for that that has an equivalence
11:58 in quantum gravity where space time at
12:02 the Planck scale
12:02 looks like a phony structure like the
12:06 head of a beer or a soda
12:08 it's called quantum foam the quantum
12:11 phone was like a bunch of little mini
12:12 wormholes popping in and out of
12:14 existence both it's called multi
12:16 connected space what that means is space
12:18 has holes punching in it there's all
12:20 kinds of whole doughnut holes going in
12:22 and out of existence fluctuating and
12:24 they occur at the Planck length and at
12:26 the point of scale of 10 to the negative
12:28 35 meters and there are predictions
12:30 cosmological predictions of what that
12:33 should do to quasar light when it's
12:37 emitted from a quasar and it reaches our
12:40 telescopes over cosmological distances
12:42 there are happen to be quasars that pop
12:45 into existence and just lucky enough and
12:47 strongly detected even supernovas and
12:49 distant galaxies do the same thing and
12:51 they emit all day all the man
12:53 the gamma radiation is the highest
12:56 electric radiation we know that the
12:57 electromagnetic spectrum and so it's
12:59 very high energy so it's an ultra short
13:03 wavelength and high energy and it's
13:06 perfect for being a diagnostic on
13:09 fluctuations in space as it propagates
13:12 through space and so they've already
13:14 determined that the effect the
13:16 accumulated effects of maybe a hundred
13:19 million or a billion light years a
13:22 travel of a gamma ray from a quasar
13:26 event or a supernova back to the Earth's
13:28 telescope that cumulated distance of 100 13:31 million to a billion light years of
13:33 space travel is going to add a whole
13:35 bunch of plunk
13:36 foam fluctuations acting on that gamma
13:39 ray the consequence of that would be to
13:42 shift its frequency okay we know who
13:44 these frequencies like in the lab but
13:46 then how does that frequency compare
13:48 when it hits the telescope is there a
13:50 shifted frequency but they have not seen
13:53 it they've done a handful of experiments
13:55 using different detector methods
13:57 different methodologies for looking at
14:00 these things and measuring them and they
14:02 all have not seen any sign of frequency
14:05 shifting of gamma rays going through
14:06 space due to plug due to the plant
14:09 fluctuations in the vacuum so what that
14:11 means if you have pore volume of a
14:15 virtual-reality then it should have been
14:17 there should have been seen because it
14:18 doesn't matter whether you call it
14:20 vacuum fluctuations of the geometry of
14:23 space or whether you call it the plunk
14:24 volumes of virtual reality they're still
14:27 going to have an effect on on the gamma
14:30 ray going through it after a billion
14:32 meters to travel billion light-years of
14:34 travelens are in distance so you're
14:36 saying that supports the idea that you
14:39 don't have yeah because you're just not
14:42 seeing the frequency shifts that would
14:45 be associated with any kind of Planck
14:47 length structure whether it be in space
14:51 itself using via the Einstein model for
14:53 space-time as a geometry or whether it
14:56 be that because that has to support the
14:59 propagation of light through that
15:02 structure and we're not seeing frequency
15:04 shifts
15:05 and so you're saying that instead
15:08 supports the idea of this phone no it
15:11 does not exist so you're saying the fact
15:16 that we don't observe the frequency
15:17 frequency shift of distant gamma rays
15:19 arriving at earth means that the punk
15:22 foam is not there for clothes everywhere
15:29 it's gonna have to be because space is
15:31 uniform isotropic on your genome okay
15:33 okay under the theory is gonna be aware
15:35 but we just heard from you that it isn't
15:36 everywhere it isn't anywhere it's just
15:39 everywhere you just said that Punk foam
15:41 can't exist or you see a frequency
15:43 shifts and gummer in you know I'm saying
15:44 the frequency shifts are indicating that
15:47 the plunk phone doesn't exist yes okay
15:50 well likewise that's that that's the
15:52 unstuck model space-time at a quantum
15:54 level
15:55 actually it's Wheeler's it's really
15:57 johnny marr smart girl okay now he's
15:59 talking about a virtual reality where
16:01 we're gonna have plunk cubes which is
16:03 his equivalent before yeah I don't know
16:05 it doesn't have to be but if he's
16:07 structuring space that's almost sounds
16:09 like the quantum West or quantum theory
16:17 and we just don't see the structure so
16:21 so now I need to resolve what sounds
16:23 like a contradiction what you're saying
16:25 first of all you say that the non ship
16:28 frequency shift in camera usually you're
16:30 not getting a previous issue emitted by
16:32 the quasar or so that would be
16:33 associated with the effects of either
16:36 this or with oh yeah understanding I'm
16:47 saying I was just answering this
16:50 question because I thought you said Quan
16:51 phones not everywhere I thought that's
16:53 what I said
16:54 so are you saying based on the fact that
16:56 you're not seeing a frequency shift are
16:58 you saying that there is no quantum foam
17:00 it's okay I didn't understand okay okay
17:04 the answer is no the lack of frequency
17:08 shift indicates that there is not
17:09 there's not appear to be any quantum
17:11 something all right
17:12 because you know it doesn't matter which
17:14 way you look at a quasar in space you'll
17:16 see one there
17:17 a supernova back there they're emitting
17:20 gamma rays and you just don't see the
17:22 signs yeah based on the so what do we
17:30 have instead of quantum phone what do we
17:32 have well there's the quantum loops and
17:34 I think I think that's also a problem
17:37 and then I don't know if if his virtual
17:40 reality it's hard to say I don't know
17:44 this theory so I don't know what he's
17:45 saying
17:47 it's either there's either going to be a
17:49 very real consequence for the space to
17:52 explain what space is C space is not
17:55 nothing
17:55 space is the physical structure and we
17:57 already know that quantum mechanically
17:59 quantum mechanically we know that space
18:01 is filled with quantum vacuum
18:02 fluctuations but they're not the back of
18:04 fluctuations of John wheelers and I'd
18:07 Stein space geometry space is not a
18:10 geometry geometry is points lines and
18:12 curves okay but space is not such a
18:16 thing space behaves like an optical
18:18 medium like a prism through which or a
18:21 tank of water or massive beam of light
18:23 domes we're back to the ether it isn't
18:26 either an Einstein reinserted thing
18:28 either with general relativity the
18:29 either of geometry if the space-time
18:32 metric was einstein's either and I mean
18:35 stone was asked about that he said well
18:37 guess what folks I just said that
18:39 space-time is a stretchable elastic
18:42 material the space-time metric is the
18:45 mathematical quantity that describes
18:47 that stretching of space-time
18:49 guess what I just reintroduced it either
18:51 into the relativity theory okay but
18:54 that's an ether of geometry and we know
18:56 that's when astronauts fly into space
18:57 they're not bumping into a bunch of
18:59 differential mat manifolds and points
19:01 and neighborhoods of points and mappings
19:03 of functions and differential equations
19:05 and all that crap that's all
19:08 mathematical that's all visual and
19:10 imaginative
19:10 it produces physics very well when you
19:14 do experimental predictions based on it
19:17 but that's not physical space quantum
19:20 theory says the physical space is filled
19:22 with vacuum fluctuations fluctuations of
19:24 what matter and any kind of a field that
19:28 problem that that
19:31 against a force of nature so I can this
19:34 be little balls connected other little
19:45 balls by a spring and there's other
19:47 little balls connected those by suppose
19:49 that example okay so you have an array
19:54 of all these little balls of massless
19:56 they don't have mass they're just
19:58 idealized point little balls that are
20:02 connected to each other across the
20:04 universe infinitely and they're
20:06 connected by Springs and they're
20:09 vibrating and when they vibrate a
20:12 certain way that representing the
20:13 electromagnetic field when they vibrate
20:15 another way they're representing
20:16 fermions and elementary particle physics
20:18 when they vibrate are like quarks and
20:20 electrons for example if they vibrate
20:22 another particular way that would be
20:25 when they when they vibrate another way
20:28 they would represent the Higgs boson and
20:30 what not okay because you haven't solved
20:41 what you're actually trying to get in
20:43 he's only partway through that so vacuum
20:46 fluctuations it's question like what the
20:49 heck are they question okay
20:52 so it's it's the infinite field of all
20:54 these coupled oscillators vibrating okay
20:57 now when you turn the temperature up
20:59 when you turn off their energy it should
21:01 classically it says the whole field of
21:04 oscillators should go an absolute rest
21:06 they should be still have no motion
21:08 whatsoever
21:09 there should be no bot oscillations of
21:11 the oscillators oscillators I mean no
21:13 vibrations of the oscillators
21:15 oscillators should classically be
21:17 absolutely still but Heisenberg's
21:19 uncertainty principle says that the
21:21 quantum scale of h-bar there's no such
21:24 thing as an absolutely quiet space-time
21:29 in other words energy is fuzzy time is
21:32 fuzzy space is fuzzy and momentum is
21:34 fuzzy when you get to the absolute
21:37 minimum of zero energy zero temperature
21:41 kinetic
21:43 potential energy of the system the total
21:45 energy of assistant comprising its
21:47 kinetic motion as potential energy
21:50 classical Newtonian physics says the
21:53 whole system is dead zero there's no
21:55 energy but quantum theory says because
21:57 of the fuzzy nature of space and time
21:59 energy momentum that you will never have
22:03 a zero infinite field the oscillators
22:08 will come down to what's the minimum
22:09 quantum amount of oscillation they will
22:12 have h-bar Omega
22:14 well no that's an energy they will have
22:16 the oscillation of h-bar over two in the
22:19 quantum energy quantum energy of the
22:21 system like a particle will be H bar
22:23 Omega over 2 and that's the zero-point
22:24 energy that means at the zero point of
22:27 temperature it's going to have an energy
22:29 that's not zero possibly has to be zero
22:32 quantum theory says it has to be one out
22:34 of an energy of a photon or the energy
22:36 the vibration well Omega is the
22:38 vibrational frequency so the vacuum is
22:41 never totally silent the vacuum is not
22:43 quite as it's not silent it's not slow
22:46 let's go back it's not dead line like a
22:48 heart attack there you go so let's go
22:50 back to the fun question there's a
22:52 fundamental question here what is what
22:57 are those pairs by the stream what are
23:06 those things
23:07 oh you mean the oscillators yeah oh the
23:09 oscillators can be anything that could
23:10 be electromagnetic oscillations of the
23:12 magnetic field the oscillators for the
23:14 electric field the electron field the
23:17 oscillators for the quark field the
23:19 oscillators for the gluon field but so
23:23 what is an oscillator for a quark field
23:25 a quark oscillator it's a quark itself
23:29 well that's a quantized workout you you
23:32 picture that the vacuum of the quarks
23:34 okay a quartz vacuum stain is going to
23:38 have quantum fluctuations
23:41 okay okay all right now the court
23:44 particle is above the vacuum it's an in
23:48 other word it okay particles are an
23:50 excited vacuum okay okay
23:52 photon is the excited vacuum state of
23:55 electromagnetic field okay a photon is
24:00 just the excited vacuum it's excited so
24:02 that represents once quantum of life so
24:04 this goes they go you'll have virtual
24:09 particle pairs that is the other okay
24:13 there are multiple vacuums
24:14 okay there's oh yes there's not one
24:17 vacuum my friend we have the vacuum is
24:20 very very complicated there's no such
24:23 thing as a single vacuum it is a
24:24 multiple vacuum that coexist with each
24:27 other okay okay now what you just asked
24:30 about is the direct vacuum the Dirac
24:33 vacuum is the vacuum of fermions okay
24:39 the draft vacuum is the vacuum the Furby
24:41 honors okay particles with one-half spin
24:47 those are electrons and quarks
24:51 if there are multiple vacuums are you
24:55 saying exist to create yeah are they so
25:04 yes that's exactly yeah it's just it's
25:07 the vacuum state of the physical reality
25:09 physical reality is not a vacuum state
25:11 that's a state where this matter is
25:15 excited to form the table you know
25:17 matter in him is excited to form the
25:19 atoms in elementary particles that form
25:21 inside the vacuum is is the quartz is
25:24 the is the state of no particles where
25:29 there's no quantum particles
25:30 representing that field so it's a very
25:33 complicated if achill thing to
25:34 understand but that's how we've
25:35 mathematically represented so if you
25:38 have a photon with energy H bar Omega
25:40 that's plants reduced cost at times the
25:43 frequency of the photon alright that the
25:47 then the vacuum state for that photon
25:50 for that light field represented by the
25:52 photon
25:53 is now going to be age 1/2 of that H bar
25:56 Omega over okay so I think we've got
25:58 roughly we go to that but now we go back
26:00 to the question he has is it possible
26:02 the universe's digital it's all
26:04 information which is one of the problems
26:05 I don't know it's there's two other
26:12 possibilities that below those co-joined
26:16 spring connected you have oscillations
26:22 corks oscillators for electrons
26:24 oscillators oscillators all the way down
26:36 and although I'm not really followed
26:40 this but it sounds like these
26:42 oscillators it's very close to instead
26:45 of saying two balls connected by a
26:47 string it gets by a spring
26:49 you could have a loop of a string that's
26:52 vibrating because it's a size length
27:12 one-dimensional object I don't I think
27:15 they will have a mass I think their mass
27:18 would be associated with a particle so
27:22 that you're gonna have a vibrating
27:23 string and vibrates one particular way
27:25 it represents an electron vibrates
27:27 another way it represents the quantum
27:28 gravity well the quantum gravity or
27:30 particle which is called the graviton it
27:33 vibrates another way it's been represent
27:34 a quark and vibrates in different ways
27:36 can be glowing well these oscillators no
27:41 no no that's just the analogy of quantum
27:43 field theory super string theory is a
27:45 completely different thing okay super
27:47 string theory does not make use of the
27:49 of the oscillator field analogy that I
27:53 just gave you from electromagnetic
27:54 radiation as a first principle
27:57 and is there any experimental evidence
27:59 at this point of the oscillator theory
28:03 no that's a mathematical foundation to
28:08 build quantum field theory from it's not
28:10 that you're looking for that that's just
28:12 that's just the math we use the math we
28:15 use that best predicts the phenomenon we
28:17 observe in nature is a quantum harmonic
28:19 oscillator equation the Hamiltonian is a
28:23 total energy that's a quantum ah that's
28:27 a quantum operator that represents the
28:29 total energy of a system a quantum
28:30 system it represents the sum of the
28:32 kinetic energy plus the potential energy
28:34 and the Hamiltonian that we use is the
28:39 harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian that
28:41 used to model the quantum fields
28:44 that's why lamb shift is a direct
28:50 clarification the existence of the
28:53 effect of quantum zero-point energy on
28:55 the fine structure of the electrons
28:58 ground state orbit and hydrogen atom and
29:00 then there was actually one earlier than
29:02 that before quantum theory was even
29:04 published in 1924 somebody did a poor I
29:07 monoxide experiment and saw a shift
29:10 inspector in which could only be
29:12 explained by the effective quantum
29:14 zero-point energy on the electron so
29:16 there's some weird matter the Casimir
29:20 effect is a direct affront of
29:21 verification of that so there was this
29:23 question states
29:31 it's a hydrogen atom it's the hydrogen
29:33 atom or if it's okay electron where it
29:35 gets approached line on a hydrogen atom
29:41 [ __ ] fine structure they call it
29:43 different ships in the orbit it's not a
29:46 perfect orbit and it's shifted by
29:48 various things like external open fields
29:51 magnetic fields whatnot well they find
29:53 that there's a little shift that Willis
29:55 lamb discovered and it's due to the fact
29:58 that the vacuum fluctuations in space
30:01 are constantly hitting that electron and
30:04 the consequence of them hitting that
30:05 electrons like a pressure being exerted
30:07 on that electron it's so it shifts its
30:09 orbit by so many
30:11 whatever the measure of that shift is
30:13 usually given in terms of an energy unit
30:14 or a frequency unit corresponding to the
30:16 shift of the orbital from one from one
30:19 place to another place so the frequency
30:22 shift would be on the order of a couple
30:24 something like 100 megahertz or whatever
30:26 and you multiply that by h-bar and
30:30 whatever you and you get the energy of
30:33 that ship so it's kind of like
30:34 information being affected by Brownian
30:36 motion yeah yeah that's essentially like
30:40 what Einstein was looking at this stuff
30:42 he said yeah that's all of the original
30:44 mathematical development for fluctuation
30:46 it's called the fluctuation dissipation
30:48 they're all started with the
30:50 experimentation with Brownian motion and
30:52 Einstein did a lot of I don't know how
30:54 many papers he did but I know he did
30:55 publications if not one on Brownian
30:59 motion and he pioneered a lot of subject
31:01 himself okay well now I'm here the
31:05 oscillate what what we call the
31:07 oscillating theory what do you call that
31:10 theory of the well it's just quantum
31:14 field theory yeah so that has to do with
31:20 the experiments you guys are doing here
31:21 wait a second
31:23 Clarett so quantum field theory covers a
31:24 much broader range yes it covers
31:26 everything so what does that particular
31:28 answer a particular one with the ATO
31:29 officially called spring-loaded
31:31 oscillators no like I said that's just
31:34 the picture for which we designed the
31:37 Hamiltonian to represent the total
31:39 energy only what's know is what is that
31:42 subset of quantum field theory called
31:44 the refers the vacuum fluctuations that
31:46 we've been discussing oh it doesn't have
31:49 any it's just it's just a vacuum state
31:52 of a field I call it the oscillating but
32:04 so that sounds to me like that has to do
32:09 it has to do with your experiments here
32:13 yeah I mean we exploit theoretically
32:17 exploit the use of quantum vacuum
32:19 fluctuations to look at things involving
32:21 the warping space-time for the for
32:26 altering in Einstein's picture be
32:29 altering the geometry of space to create
32:32 space work that allows you to go faster
32:33 in line in-house model how has the
32:36 polarizable vacuum model of general
32:39 polarizable vacuum representation of
32:41 general relativity that's not using the
32:44 einstein geometry instead we're using
32:45 the vacuum fluctuations vacuum
32:48 fluctuations are like the atoms in a
32:50 prison of glass those atoms are
32:53 electrically polarizable and polarized
32:57 glass has something to do with whether
32:59 light propagates slow or fast then it's
33:03 vacuum value okay compared to its vacuum
33:06 value the equivalent of that actually
33:10 reproduces general relativity so what
33:12 you see in the geometry pictures
33:15 space-time can be reproduced up to a
33:17 certain point by the optical medium or
33:20 the either version where the vacuum is
33:25 not a geometry but it's an actual
33:28 physical either it's a plenum of quantum
33:32 fluctuation and if you exert an external
33:34 feel you can put on that on those
33:36 fluctuations you can polarize them and
33:39 the consequence of the polarization
33:40 could either speed up this increase the
33:42 speed of light or decreases either life
33:44 or and the and the consequences of that
33:47 have the equivalent of producing a
33:50 wormhole or what warp drive and so
33:53 you're saying that very recently
33:54 published research confirms that view
33:57 there's just theoretically now very
34:00 recent research theoretical studies on
34:03 using quantum field theory have
34:05 confirmed that view for the definition
34:07 of the speed of light they've actually
34:09 been able to define by calculation using
34:12 those vacuum fluctuations what the
34:15 constants of universal constants are
34:17 when you multiply them together it's the
34:19 electric field permittivity when I met
34:22 permeability a vacuum and they have cars
34:27 fixed constants no one ever understood
34:29 why that is you multiply the two
34:31 together take the square root invert it
34:33 that's the speed of light so they've
34:35 been able to calculate that from first
34:38 principles using quantum vacuum
34:39 fluctuations for the first time so that
34:42 shows you that the speed of light has
34:43 its finite universal value because it's
34:46 going through a polarized vacuum it's
34:48 being in other words it's like a beam of
34:51 light going through a block of glass
34:53 that that energy and that beam of light
34:56 is being absorbed by the atoms in the
34:58 glass three of three a minute reabsorbed
35:00 three a minute ribs work so that that
35:03 darn light can cannot move at the vacuum
35:06 value because it's not a document it's
35:08 being slowed down it's being dragged
35:10 down like there's fred chance - there's
35:12 a friction acting on it from the rate
35:13 constant reabsorption readmission in
35:15 this case - so in this case the vacuum
35:18 itself it's just like is a nonlinear
35:21 optical medium it's not fluctuations of
35:24 dissipations going on among the
35:25 fluctuating fields of nature and it just
35:28 so happens that those fluctuating fields
35:30 are slowing the speed of light down from
35:33 whatever value it could be it probably
35:35 could be infinite slowing it down to a
35:37 finite value that we observe it today
35:39 and unless that needs a medium that is
35:44 medium but if if light needed the medium
35:46 to propagate through if there wasn't a
35:48 medium it doesn't have it's your plan
35:49 for this because I've never seen anybody
35:56 do a calculation where if there's no
35:58 medium well look possibly it's always
36:01 been treated that vacuum that's in
36:08 congruent we don't know using that
36:11 picture that classical picture why the
36:13 speed of light has the value does here
36:15 with the plumbing vacuum flushes
36:16 fluctuations being the medium of space
36:18 that explains why the speed of light has
36:21 is finite but recall no no emanation can
36:24 propagate without a medium that the kind
36:28 of media requires propagate
36:29 you don't get sound going through vacuum
36:31 scissors
36:32 propagated correct so if the light is
36:35 propagating across that and that
36:36 probably is it's that's its medium of
36:40 propagation and so this it's almost out
36:45 that's right that's meaningless there is
36:47 no there's no such thing
36:48 yeah because the vacuum is not a zero
36:51 state right and it's not there we don't
36:54 know what a zero state is well it's not
36:56 because vectors is zero States because
36:57 light means that yeah that's right and
37:00 hence thing the light might have an
37:02 influence speed if it didn't have a
37:03 vacuum I didn't have that clock swishes
37:05 is essentially a non-secular yeah the
37:08 two papers that got published were in
37:10 the European physics journal Dean I
37:19 think I think that case I'm not sure
37:22 they use the particle pairs of the Dirac
37:25 vacuum they might have done that I think
37:27 that's what they were using when the
37:28 particle pairs like the like the virtual
37:31 electron in court so I'm looking for
37:34 just a yes or no here is say how's work
37:39 on and whoever else is involved in here
37:41 on momentum and inertia is that a mean
37:45 mass and inertia
37:46 all right mass inertia is that proposed
37:48 in terms of the Dirac particle field or
37:50 some other aspect of active he started
37:52 that no the answer is No he began that
37:56 on the basis of the electromagnetic back
37:58 yeah and that's the mistake because he
38:01 now knows that the vacuum is more
38:04 complicated than that you don't have one
38:06 backing you've got several here's the
38:07 vacuum you have the electromagnetic
38:10 vacuum and you have electric let's the
38:12 start with forces in nature we have
38:15 three forces gravity's not forced by the
38:17 way when Einstein derived general
38:18 relativity get removed gravity as a
38:20 fundamental force of nature it proved
38:23 that gravity is an emergent force it
38:25 emerges from curvature curving
38:28 space-time space-time curvature the
38:30 change in geometry around but I just
38:33 said that that's wrong that the space
38:34 isn't geometric well I know that's
38:37 that's the next step we already know
38:39 Einstein's general theory isn't perfect
38:41 we aren't you know it has problems it
38:42 works beautifully I mean
38:45 predicts all the phenomena we've
38:46 observed including the really bizarre
38:48 stuff and there are more to to verify
38:50 more predictions we have to verify
38:52 experiment before we wrap it up but it
38:54 has other problems okay and I'm not
38:56 going to get that besides the point okay
38:58 so my train of thought is lost so I
39:00 gotta go you say you're talking about
39:02 the three forces okay yes
39:04 so it's an emergent theory and it
39:07 resides within the fact that a mass or a
39:09 glom of energy in a local region of
39:11 space will bend that space and that
39:14 bending is what we feel is gravity it's
39:16 not that there is not a fundamental
39:18 force then you want to address yeah so
39:20 the three forces of nature are really
39:21 deal with the electromagnetic force the
39:23 weak force which is responsible for
39:25 radioactive decay and particle particles
39:28 changing their identity
39:30 and which is important which is another
39:32 way of saying particle maintainer and
39:34 the strong nuclear force which is
39:36 basically the forest of ports and gluons
39:38 okay all right so so you've got those
39:45 things are the different kinds of
39:46 vacuums yeah so we've got those three
39:48 things to deal with and house analysis
39:50 didn't consider those other things now
39:52 here's the interesting thing it was
39:54 shown later on by Steven Weinberg and
39:57 obtuse long we've got the Nobel Prize in
39:59 Physics for unifying the electromagnetic
40:02 force with the weak force so that force
40:04 is called the electroweak force so it
40:08 turns out that the vacuum for the
40:09 electromagnetic field the quantum vacuum
40:11 is the same vacuum for the weak field
40:14 because it's not as two separate forces
40:17 they're the same force okay at low
40:20 energy they break apart and appear to be
40:23 separate forces but when you look at the
40:25 fundamentals of the weak force the weak
40:27 force is built up out of the photon
40:29 States photons are the quantized
40:32 electromagnetic field okay so so there's
40:36 really now you're really down to two
40:38 real vacuum vacuum if you left a weak
40:42 vacuum which is based a vacuum which is
40:44 basically the vacuum of the
40:45 electromagnetic and then we force unify
40:47 and then the to vacuum structures that
40:51 are buried within the court force and
40:52 that's another story and that story is
40:55 so as the direct field food in there is
40:58 that
40:58 well spring is out because we're do rap
41:01 oh dear a field theory or the direct
41:03 part of the theory is that yeah it's in
41:07 the important drugs
41:08 directs equations used to work there
41:10 okay there's used to build the field
41:12 theory so how good how was doing the
41:19 electromagnetic yeah okay so what hal
41:21 left out was now it doesn't matter that
41:24 you leave out the weak force that's
41:26 actually ridiculous because actually the
41:28 weak force is weaker than
41:29 electromagnetic force so you can you can
41:31 and the weak force only acts on the
41:34 scale of less than the size of a proton
41:37 okay so that's how important it is okay
41:40 it only acts within the scale over the
41:43 scale within the size of a proton so or
41:45 the body so you don't need to worry
41:47 about the weak force just focus on that
41:48 election that guy now for the strong
41:50 force okay
41:52 the strong force has to do with a dual
41:55 vacuum structure it's got two vacuum and
41:59 you have the balcony for our house yeah
42:01 this is really scary it depends upon the
42:05 type of partner because you have you
42:06 have what are called hadrons and hadrons
42:10 are the class of particles that have two
42:11 different classes of particles period
42:13 the subclasses of hadrons are maisons
42:15 and the other subclass of hadrons are
42:17 very owns the baryons are the protons
42:21 and neutrons that form our atomic nuclei
42:23 okay that's a baryon had the main signs
42:27 are actually temporary and transient
42:30 particles they are a particle which is
42:34 actually a vacuum a living vacuum
42:35 fluctuation it is a quark an accord pair
42:38 but they don't dilate because it's
42:40 because to annihilate you have to have
42:43 these same cork and it's anti particle
42:46 in order to normally like for example
42:48 you know they're up and down strange top
42:51 and bottom quarks and charm quarks okay
42:53 for a quark antiquark pair to annihilate
42:56 it has to be the up court and the anti
42:58 up quark okay okay the reason why masons
43:02 don't disappear in a flash of
43:03 annihilated energy like gamma rays
43:05 winner is because they're made out of a
43:07 court and an anti demo
43:09 a strange cool
43:11 an anti charm or a bottom quark and Anna
43:14 don't match they don't match that's
43:16 right hey kid I'm Riley so the only way
43:19 a particle/anti-particle pair can
43:21 annihilate is if the two particles in
43:23 the pair are the matching that your mom
43:25 is engines yeah so when they're not
43:27 matching anti particle particle pairs
43:29 they cannot neither so that's why these
43:31 arms are long-lived okay okay well that
43:35 is a vacuum fluctuation because those
43:37 are virtual those particle pairs come
43:40 out of the vacuum and they live for a
43:42 period of time and the purpose of what
43:44 they do is they transmit the strong one
43:47 part of the strong nuclear force the
43:50 baryons those are the things that form
43:52 matter okay but that's what are the
43:55 nuclei of atoms are built out of
43:56 neutrons protons and they're excited
43:58 versions of those and we don't need to
43:59 worry about those baryon said he said
44:11 they were virtual yes the Masons are
44:13 opposed to virtual electrolyzers I mean
44:16 virtual port in the world that we don't
44:48 give let's just say it's a shadow world
44:50 where all the vacuum fluctuations live
44:51 the vacuum state of everything we don't
44:54 we don't feel that we don't interact
44:56 your scientific instruments can't but
44:58 all of us we don't have indeed okay it's
45:02 like a shadow universe in our at our
45:04 level of existence okay so I think
45:08 you're interested here because the word
45:10 virtual sounds somewhat like what
45:12 camel's talking yeah so that's what
45:14 we're trying to get you there okay okay
45:17 now the now the marianas have three
45:19 quarks any combination of three courts
45:21 okay now inside them it turns out that
45:24 they
45:25 there's a vacuum inside you know why
45:26 those corks have really low mass and our
45:29 fact those corks almost are just a
45:31 couple of hundred times more massive
45:33 than electrons surprisingly or something
45:35 on that something on that order
45:37 okay so they're very low mass and as a
45:40 matter of fact they happen to be at the
45:41 ground state those quirks inside protons
45:43 and neutrons live in the ground state
45:45 well the ground state is the
45:47 old-fashioned quantum mechanical
45:49 terminology for vacuum state so those
45:52 you know what the mass of those protons
45:55 and neutrons really are less than a
45:57 feather that's right that was another
46:01 big paper just a couple years ago
46:02 somebody used a whole bunch of
46:03 supercomputers they use for theory uh
46:06 yeah they use it's called quantum
46:08 chromodynamics that's the field theory
46:11 for quarks and gluons
46:12 you'll set that in the Dirac equation
46:14 okay that theory can't predict the mass
46:20 of the proton or the neutron and it
46:22 should because you've got the energy of
46:25 the three quarks inside that bag we we
46:28 say that the body that produces the
46:30 proton the neutron is a bag there's some
46:32 kind of a boundary condition there and
46:34 the nature the force of quarks is they
46:37 don't fly free they're absolutely bound
46:39 inside that bag and they could never fly
46:41 free unless they're hit by a lot of
46:42 energy that can break them apart
46:44 temporarily and then they're going to go
46:45 back to being bad so we've got from
46:47 string theory the bag theory okay the
46:58 quarks are bound together by three
47:00 Springs the springs have very powerful
47:04 spring coefficients to pull one of these
47:07 quarks or any all three of the quarks
47:09 away from the center where all the
47:10 springs come together the further apart
47:13 you pull the harder it becomes to pull
47:16 because the spring coefficient climbs
47:18 exponentially so when they're inside
47:21 that little tiny bag which is the size
47:24 of a proton or a neutron or any other
47:25 baryon they're free to move around they
47:28 free these bounce around free inside
47:30 there but if you start trying to pull
47:31 one of those or both of those or all
47:33 three of those quarks out beyond the
47:35 just beyond the radius of the bag forget
47:37 it
47:38 that the string the string coefficient
47:40 this I'm sorry the spring coefficient of
47:43 the of the quantum chromodynamics force
47:46 increases linearly it increases linearly
47:49 and it pulls those quirks back in okay
47:52 alright so this this is setting the
47:54 stage here so just bear with me
47:56 so those three quarks are running around
47:58 loose and free on the inside of that bag
48:01 so and they had very bad ground state
48:03 energy back in state a very low mass
48:05 alright turns out that most of what's in
48:09 that bag is vacuum just empty space so
48:11 they didn't know how to use quantum
48:13 chromodynamics field theory to calculate
48:15 the mass of the proton based on that
48:17 model when they get the calculation
48:19 finally for the first time ever they got
48:21 the mass of the proton perfect to within
48:25 like I don't remember a whole bunch of
48:27 decimal places it was like a Six Sigma
48:28 calculation I think it was okay for the
48:31 first time and you know what that after
48:33 you know what gave it that answer most
48:35 of the mass and the proton is vacuum
48:37 energy it's due to the vacuum energy
48:39 like 300 one percent of the mass of the
48:43 proton is to to the quarks alone
48:46 that means over 99% of the mass of the
48:49 court is due to the vacuum energy
48:51 contained inside of it but is that any
48:55 different inside yes that's a free
48:58 vacuum inside where the court seemed
49:00 bounce around on the outside where the
49:03 quarks can't be pulled out that's called
49:06 the frozen vacuum that is called the
49:09 frozen vacuum that's because the because
49:12 now you're in the region where the
49:14 spring force the spring can that
49:16 coupling those three quarters all
49:18 together is so powerful the quarks you
49:20 can't do anything with them those if you
49:22 get those quirks out of the bag right
49:23 there that there just froze they're
49:25 stuck there and I'm using a very crude
49:28 analogy here yeah so it's called the
49:31 frozen non perturbative vacuum and i
49:33 don't worry about that turnarounds you
49:35 guys it just means that you were in a
49:38 different value on the outside of the
49:39 baryon on the outside the proton on the
49:42 outside of the neutron
49:43 then you are on the inside and that has
49:45 a completely different energy associated
49:47 with okay so let's let's take your time
49:50 and I've got a I got a good book to give
49:54 you guys I can put it out for you that
49:56 one of my professors at the University
49:58 of Arizona wrote back in the 80s called
49:59 destruct the structured vacuum and he
50:03 goes through that whole thing he and his
50:05 buddy Bert Muller another physicists
50:06 have a conversational inter interaction
50:09 of each other where they're burnt talks
50:11 were filthy talks and they're asking and
50:14 answering each other's questions and
50:16 they have graphical illustration you
50:18 guys love it because it will explain
50:20 everything I've said okay so my next
50:22 just brief question because it's not a
50:24 nursery germane but okay so you've got
50:28 okay you've got one kind of vacuum
50:32 inside you've got it no when I say kind
50:35 I mean by the way it has a name anything
50:42 inside anything that's bounded by a
50:44 boundary condition that has a boundary
50:45 condition involved whether whether it's
50:47 a ball two parallel plates a parallel
50:50 pipe things like that the energy on the
50:59 outside is not it's a melted vacuum okay
51:01 no that you stop right there
51:02 no I'm sorry I'm sorry that's the wrong
51:04 word it's the frozen back okay and you
51:09 just gave me the answer I forgot that
51:11 Kasmir vacuum has a second name because
51:13 those quarks are loose in three because
51:15 the spring has nearly zero spring force
51:18 is inside it's called the Milton vacuum
51:21 that's because the frozen vacuum on the
51:23 on the melted on the inside that's why
51:26 the quarks are like they're in a liquid
51:28 there okay now you've got the melted
51:33 vacuum inside the barrel correct and you
51:36 have the frozen thank you but then do
51:38 you have when you get outside no
51:42 superposing the frozen quark value is
51:46 the electromagnet what form I get it
51:48 back that's where they coexist all right
51:51 what are the electromagnetic vacuum
51:53 exists inside of the baryon we don't
51:54 know because I don't know that Maxwell's
51:57 equations have ever been taken down to
51:58 that actually it's quantum
51:59 electrodynamic
52:00 so Monday matter of scale going to keep
52:02 that forever yeah and I don't know whose
52:04 don't even work on that I know that the
52:06 equations for quarks do involve color
52:10 charts because quirks out one third
52:13 electric charge they also have color
52:14 that's the nature of the strong force
52:17 that's another charge well the equations
52:19 that describe the interaction that's
52:21 chroma looks just like Maxwell's
52:24 equations of electrodynamics you have
52:26 electric forces and magnetic forces but
52:28 those are acting on the color charges
52:30 now I hear austrack huh we're trying to
52:33 get to the virtual part okay well that's
52:36 it the virtual products new with the oh
52:39 well the virtual part would be that
52:41 frozen vacuum we don't experience the
52:43 frozen vacuum so that's got to be the
52:45 virtual vacuum for quarks I know
52:52 look virtual just think of it as a
52:54 shadow a shadow universe that that we
52:56 live in we our instruments can see it
53:00 can feel it but we can't because we're
53:02 too big scale its operating its
53:04 operating its operating us everywhere it
53:08 surrounds us but we can't see what it's
53:10 doing well that's maybe you should read
53:14 Rafael scheme Euler's book you might get
53:15 a better idea it might give you but they
53:20 use common language you know there's
53:22 some there's some jargon but they don't
53:23 go out of the way don't worry about
53:25 there's no this was a beautiful little
53:30 book they went out of print and you get
53:33 a PDF of it for free on the internet so
53:35 I'll turn it out for you slide your
53:38 simile okay oh I'll just send you the
53:41 PDF I don't how many of these shadow
53:46 vacuums well if you reduce out the fact
53:50 that the weak force is really the
53:52 electromagnetic force then there's an
53:54 electromagnetic vacuum and there's two
53:58 to quantum chromodynamics oculus and now
54:02 that they discovered the Higgs particle
54:04 that is a vacuum so it has its own that
54:07 okay just a brief sight thing you are
54:10 you think they have discovered the Higgs
54:13 part
54:14 I would explain did you say it's ro
54:16 because I don't want to they haven't
54:19 confirmed it to my satisfaction okay
54:22 yeah they have not confirmed it to my
54:25 satisfaction and even they have said
54:26 even they're saying they even now they
54:30 have said they confirmed it but they
54:32 said that that did not exclude the
54:33 existence of other Higgs particles and
54:36 that's the first time I ever heard of
54:37 other particles I am a student of
54:40 quantum field theory and when I was
54:41 brought up at the University of Arizona
54:42 in the 80s there was only one freakin
54:44 Higgs particle that ever existed in the
54:46 standard model that was added in the
54:48 standard model of particle physics and
54:49 all of a sudden some I haven't been
54:52 paying attention to the Higgs Theory so
54:54 between then and now somehow there's
54:56 been an explosion of additional Higgs
54:58 particles I don't know how many there
54:59 are so they're saying okay we definitely
55:02 see the one but that does not exclude
55:04 the existence of others at the nearby
55:06 mass and so first personally is being
55:09 complicated
55:10 yeah it's getting more complicated yeah
55:12 I just don't know that Higgs is going to
55:15 live up to its high verification as
55:18 being the particle that gives mass to
55:19 particles or the field that gives master
55:22 partners the original gates concept I
55:25 understood it and I understood that in
55:27 its ground state its vacuum state there
55:29 is a coupling to other fields of nature
55:33 the other vacuum that makes the
55:35 particles like the electron and if we
55:38 give master dr. odd and get master the
55:40 neutrino to get master quarks and
55:42 whatnot but they don't know what the
55:45 coupling coefficients are between the
55:47 vacuum state of the Higgs and the mouse
55:49 and the Higgs Theory doesn't even
55:52 predict that the Higgs Theory doesn't
55:54 even pretty what the vacuum state is and
55:56 the Giggs vacuum state is what gives it
55:58 to dinner G okay good so I'm not even
56:02 jump in
56:03 yeah so they have discovered at least
56:05 that but I'm not enough satisfied until
56:07 I see like a Six Sigma result they
56:10 claimed there somewhere outgoing up to
56:12 four Sigma 5 Sigma by now oh I think
56:15 they said they've got 5 Sigma that's
56:17 pretty convincing but they still need to
56:19 do more statistics to see what the darn
56:21 thing is okay all right so
56:23 we have these shadows these three shadow
56:26 vacuums vacuum structures which sounds
56:30 like more mathematical constructs known
56:32 as physical okay it is based on the fact
56:36 that it is predicted by an aura but
56:38 physical amazing amazingly we see its
56:41 consequences in experiments okay so one
56:47 of the reasons that might actually be
56:48 what he's talking about and he's miss he
56:51 I don't know what he's doing so he may
56:53 have it in there and I and and I don't
56:55 know it or he may be miss disconnecting
56:58 he he's not you've got a disconnect
57:00 there I think that part of it is it uses
57:02 a different vocabulary than you do and
57:04 so if the question is if you're talking
57:06 about the same thing yeah that's a good
57:07 question is his virtual reality the
57:10 shadow the virtual vacuum fluctuations
57:13 or is it something different is it us is
57:17 it a an over layer of the vacuum
57:19 fluctuations of nature or is it

00:00 from Abbey Road Sun King by the Beatles
00:03 you know during an earlier paradigm of
00:05 course humans worshipped the Sun looked
00:07 at the Sun as as a god I guess some of
00:09 us here in Las Vegas still do but we've
00:12 moved on one of the people the premier
00:15 chroniclers of a paradigm shifts like
00:18 that the guy who has pulled all these
00:20 threads together into a central
00:22 narrative dealing with UFOs and other
00:24 mysteries has been dr. jacques ballet
00:27 I've spoken about dr. ballet and
00:28 interviewed him on this program and my
00:30 opinion of him in this field isn't is no
00:33 no secret I think he's the like the most
00:36 important thinker ever to write about
00:38 the topic so about a year ago there was
00:40 a meeting Tom met with Jacques Vallee a
00:43 face to face I'm not gonna say too much
00:45 about it except that going into it
00:48 dr. ballet was skeptical and reluctant
00:50 and now I opened this book up gods man
00:54 and war and he's written the foreword
00:56 and he writes the experience of the
00:58 unknown is only deepened raising
01:00 unsettling questions about the intrusion
01:02 of the uncanny into our shiny modern
01:05 world of convenient machines and
01:07 superficial entertainment he calls the
01:10 book a bold re-examination of the
01:12 meaning and nature of unexplained aerial
01:15 phenomena and it is and the co-writer is
01:18 Peter Levin des he joins us in just a
01:20 moment stick around
01:21 welcome back Peter Levin des is a
01:24 scholar and author of multiple books
01:26 he's been on coast to coast
01:27 numerous times he's interviewed Nazis
01:29 neo-nazis clan men Klansmen Satanists
01:33 witches occultists intelligence agents
01:36 clergymen bogus clergymen businessmen
01:39 military folks and others and is the
01:41 co-author of secret machines God's man
01:44 and war welcome back the program Peter
01:46 thank you very much George
01:48 let me start let me start this way is
01:51 this the book you set out to write when
01:53 you and Tom first got together and
01:54 talked about it is this what you figured
01:56 you would do or did that change
01:57 somewhere along the way well it's
01:59 changed of course because uh in large
02:02 part because of the kinds of
02:04 conversations that Tom was having uh
02:07 with people that he was talking to so I
02:10 was getting some information that I had
02:13 not had before
02:14 I had gotten perspectives and different
02:17 types of perception on this on this
02:19 phenomenon that I had not had before I
02:21 came to the subject from a different
02:23 direction I didn't come to it as a
02:25 believer in UFOs or a UAP or anything
02:30 like that I came into it from its
02:33 historical interest to me because of
02:34 every time I tried to research something
02:37 in American history it seen a UFO popped
02:39 up somewhere in the storyline or a UFO
02:42 experience or people connected with the
02:44 UFO phenomenon so I was fascinated by
02:46 this by this kind of thing so I was
02:48 researching all of that and doing a lot
02:50 of study on the personalities that
02:53 surrounded the phenomenon in especially
02:55 the last half of the 20th century and
02:57 then you know Tom and I start talking
03:00 and Thomas telling me about things that
03:02 he's having discussions he's having
03:04 conversations and it's it's opening up
03:07 new avenues of Investigation and but
03:10 most importantly it's causing me to
03:13 rethink a lot of what I already thought
03:15 that I already knew about this
03:18 phenomenon from reading you know over a
03:20 hundred books and so many declassified
03:23 documents from various government
03:24 agencies in the military and everything
03:26 else you build up a certain picture and
03:29 then there are conversations that we had
03:31 which which opened up new avenues and
03:34 said wait a minute you know and I began
03:36 to think really carefully and really
03:38 intensively on this subject around the
03:41 data that we had and the the data that
03:44 we were getting and realizing that I had
03:46 to rethink this project because I was
03:49 becoming excited by the possibilities I
03:51 started to realize that there is
03:53 something that's I hate to use the word
03:56 you know paradigm shifts because
03:57 everybody uses that for for anything you
03:59 know I knew McDonald's hamburgers a
04:01 paradigm check but in this case it
04:04 really was for me it changed the
04:06 paradigm the paradigm was we are going
04:09 to proceed from the from the
04:11 understanding that the phenomenon is
04:14 real that's the very first thing you
04:16 know we're proceeding from there we're
04:17 not trying to prove it I mean I think
04:19 that's been done to death there are so
04:21 many books with so many sightings and so
04:23 much of this stuff has gone on already
04:25 nobody needs another book on sightings
04:27 at the
04:28 point unless it's something really
04:29 earth-shaking so what we're doing is
04:31 just saying let's proceed on the
04:32 assumption that it's real because we do
04:33 accept it I accept that it's real and
04:35 I've never had a UFO experience you know
04:38 I accept that it's real based on on the
04:40 data based on the evidence the
04:42 eyewitness testimonies the the radar
04:44 scans I mean all the other stuff that's
04:46 come in over the last 50 years or longer
04:48 leads me to have to to the inescapable
04:51 conclusion that this is a real
04:53 phenomenon whatever it is
04:54 so we'll proceed from that point of view
04:57 and then we go back and look at
05:00 everything that's going on before
05:01 suddenly it all becomes a little clearer
05:04 what's going on in you know in history
05:07 and society in general and that's why
05:09 volume one God's is really about
05:13 religion but not from the purely sort of
05:17 zecharia sitchin point of view or the
05:19 erich von daniken point of view you know
05:21 of trying to reinterpret religion in
05:23 terms of aliens it's a completely
05:25 different approach I think it is it is
05:28 and we're gonna cover it let me ask you
05:30 this and then Tom can jump back in did
05:32 you buy the characterization of the
05:36 government folks the military folks as
05:38 the good guys you've written so much
05:39 about collaboration with Nazis about
05:42 cover-ups secret societies bad things
05:45 that have been done supposedly in the
05:47 interests of national security or
05:49 economic security or whatever deals with
05:51 the devil I think about UFO stories that
05:54 that I've written about cover-ups and
05:57 disinformation that's put out in lies
05:59 that are told spying on UFO researchers
06:01 and infiltrating UFO organizations I
06:04 guess as you accumulate all this
06:06 information read those hundred books do
06:08 you feel now that the end justifies the
06:11 means well there's a mouthful there let
06:15 me back sorry about that you're
06:17 absolutely correct that I've written
06:20 about government interference in in
06:22 virtually every aspect of our lives I
06:24 mean uh I've covered you know the
06:26 assassinations and you know Watergate
06:28 and iran-contra on and on and on so when
06:31 it comes to the government interfering
06:32 and things they shouldn't be when the
06:34 yeah you're on a percent correct
06:36 so I'm not naive I think that's one of
06:38 the reasons why I mean Tom can correct
06:41 me if I'm wrong but I think
06:42 one of the reasons why Tom had me on
06:43 this is because I brought that kind of
06:46 skepticism and and that that kind of
06:49 John destino sort of perception to all
06:51 of us to see if I could separate the
06:53 wheat from the chaff on this because yes
06:56 we've done a lot of you know we've done
06:58 a lot of things I mean the UFO community
06:59 is very well aware of it but I think
07:02 Tom's approach was unique and he sold me
07:05 on this approach which is the UFO
07:08 community has been in an adversarial
07:10 relationship with the government and the
07:13 military since this whole thing began
07:15 really we but we knew we were being lied
07:17 to in the 1940s and 1950s it just was no
07:21 doubt about it I mean a lot of sixties
07:22 seventies eighties nineties yeah well
07:25 yes yes starting from the forties and
07:26 fifties but going on from there so we've
07:28 been lied to there's no question about
07:30 it and there is an adversarial position
07:31 and they have infiltrated UFO groups and
07:34 they've had tried they tried to do what
07:35 they could but this raised a red flag to
07:38 me and it said well why are they doing
07:40 this you know what is the reason for it
07:43 seems like an awful waste of time and
07:45 money and personnel to go after a bunch
07:48 of people they regarded as tinfoil hat
07:50 UFO freaks right what's why why then why
07:54 what was the reason what was the what
07:56 what what what do they get from it cui
07:58 bono as they say right who benefits from
08:00 this kind of of intrusion into the lives
08:03 of American citizens they're protecting
08:05 something and this all went on really
08:09 straight through the Cold War and I
08:11 think we have to understand that
08:13 political environment as well this whole
08:15 thing with the UFO stuff especially the
08:17 really intensive things that happened
08:19 was happening all the way up to uh you
08:22 know up to 1989 at least the fall of the
08:24 Soviet Union the Berlin Wall coming down
08:26 and all of that I think when uh Tom's uh
08:30 one of times people said now is a good
08:33 time or now is the right time for this
08:35 it's because we're past that that that
08:38 phase of in extreme danger and this
08:41 ideological conflict that we had with
08:44 the Soviet Union and with the Chinese as
08:45 well and Cuba all the communist
08:48 countries lumped in one big umbrella
08:49 we're at a point now where things are
08:52 dividing up things are splitting up in
08:53 ways that they hadn't before
08:55 and this may be the time to start
08:58 talking seriously about what this
08:59 phenomenon is and by approaching the
09:02 government the way tom has by saying
09:05 look we're not the adversaries
09:07 we're not the enemies we're not going to
09:08 accuse you of all sorts of skullduggery
09:10 tell us what the truth is if you can't
09:13 if you can't tell us you can't you know
09:16 we understand about security clearances
09:19 we understand you can't violate them or
09:21 you go to jail oh we understand you'll
09:23 lose your reputation and your livelihood
09:25 if nothing else if you violate these
09:27 things and I've known people like this I
09:29 mean I belong to organizations I hang
09:31 out with with intelligence people and
09:33 everything else these are very serious
09:34 people and it doesn't mean they're all
09:36 evil they're not trying to you know
09:38 disrupt our lives necessarily but they
09:41 have their orders and they have their
09:42 security clearances so our approach was
09:45 tell us the truth or tell us nothing you
09:48 know be open with us as much as you can
09:51 if you can't be direct with us give us
09:54 some hints drop us some crumbs tell us
09:57 like like it Woodward and Bernstein you
09:58 know during Watergate if you can't tell
10:01 us then just you know give us a hint or
10:02 you know if I'm saying the right thing
10:04 you know don't hang up okay if I'm
10:07 talking nonsense then hang up the phone
10:09 remember that famous scene and whatever
10:11 all the President's Men so you take an
10:15 approach like that you know and then Tom
10:17 will come to me with information and
10:19 again I'm skeptical I remember very
10:21 clearly you know the dodi Benowitz case
10:23 and all these other gals I was going to
10:25 mention that I mean that ruined that
10:26 guy's life you know ruined oh absolutely
10:28 and you know Linda Moulton Howe was
10:30 dragged into it as well you know the
10:32 thing that that I find sort of salutary
10:37 about all of this is that we as been
10:40 right by we and me mostly Tom Tom
10:42 approached them
10:43 no one's approached us no one said hey
10:46 I've got some great you know video to
10:48 show you or got some you know documents
10:50 that you shouldn't see you know you can
10:51 look at them but you can't take them
10:53 home
10:53 none of that stuff has been happening
10:54 you know there's been none of that
10:56 there's been there's been a sort of
10:58 arm's length
10:59 slowly but surely we'll give you a
11:01 little bit we'll see what you're going
11:02 to do with it you know are you going to
11:04 betray us are you going to you know blow
11:06 our our our relationship in some way or
11:09 are you going to handle this
11:10 respectfully and seriously are you
11:12 serious individuals and I think that
11:15 when we started to work on this thing
11:17 and I worked on God's the first volume
11:20 of what's going to be a nonfiction
11:21 trilogy and I wrote the opening
11:24 statement which is really kind of a
11:27 mission statement of aired the prologue
11:28 to the book I think people realize
11:30 number one we were not you know crazy
11:33 enthusiasts going out there and
11:35 believing you know six impossible things
11:37 before breakfast that was good you know
11:40 plus we took a very sort of calm and
11:43 skeptical and scholarly approach to the
11:46 subject matter but from a different
11:48 angle completely we did we did stuff we
11:52 do things in that book that I think have
11:54 not been done before we're challenging
11:56 the UFO community in a way that I think
11:59 it has not they have not been challenged
12:01 before and they need kind of from my
12:03 point of view as someone who's a
12:04 relative outsider they need this kind of
12:07 challenge they need to see that the
12:09 challenge is good because we're getting
12:10 at something much more important in
12:13 something deeper well there's something
12:14 in here to check off pretty much
12:15 everybody starting with the ufologists
12:18 and churches and government people and I
12:22 mean you've pretty much covered the
12:24 covered the gamut Tom I'm gonna hit you
12:25 with the same question I mean you read
12:27 all these UFO books coming up as you're
12:31 on the learning curve about the bad
12:33 things government has done to
12:35 individuals and organizations
12:37 disinformation lies and things of that
12:39 sort
12:39 do you just give them a pass for that
12:40 based on what you know now I do with
12:44 this subject matter I do I mean I in the
12:47 government is is not one entity or it's
12:50 not one group of people at all talk to
12:53 each other I mean you're talking about a
12:54 multitrillion-dollar
12:56 uh you know corporation with many
12:59 different divisions you know that that
13:01 don't talk to each other that have all
13:02 of their own motives for everything they
13:05 do but on this very specific subject
13:08 matter on the end justifies the means
13:11 and once you start to you know Peter
13:14 definitely knows a lot more than the
13:17 average scholar on this subject matter
13:19 because just by nature of being involved
13:22 in the secret machine
13:23 project but I think he can he can vouch
13:25 for this next statement when you start
13:27 knowing some of the the stronger details
13:32 of what's going on you look through a
13:36 completely different filter on on
13:39 everything they did for the decades
13:41 before I mean the you literally I I can
13:45 look at some of those books and some of
13:47 those things have been written about JFK
13:48 being assassinated because he was going
13:50 to bring all the UFO material out
13:52 there's a there's a quite a long history
13:54 of that conspiracy I can actually look
13:57 at that and go well I you know there
14:00 there's a part of me that goes I can see
14:01 people coming to the conclusion they
14:03 needed to do that once you know some of
14:05 this stuff I'm not saying it's right I'm
14:07 not saying I'm for it
14:09 it's just when you try to be objective
14:11 on this stuff and you look at something
14:12 that was potentially existential threat
14:16 you know it's like in and and they're
14:19 working on something and they're trying
14:21 to get something trying to get something
14:23 right to to to defend us you know you
14:26 don't want to blow it up why right when
14:29 you're having some progress so you start
14:31 to look at things in such a different
14:33 perspective and in that it's really
14:37 mind-blowing to be honest but I don't
14:39 have all the facts and I don't give
14:41 everyone a pass I just know what this
14:43 subject matter
14:44 I think it's an end justifies the means
14:46 kind of situation and I and I would have
14:49 to agree well you know how it is I'll
14:51 start with you and then bring Peter back
14:52 into it but you know how it is people
14:54 want the information right now they hear
14:56 all right Tom a year ago you said you
14:58 had this panel of advisers and you're
15:00 working toward disclosure you're gonna
15:02 get to the bottom of this thing where is
15:03 it you know I get it pretty much but no
15:06 matter what show we cover if we don't
15:10 reveal the whole thing in the first five
15:11 minutes people will get ticked off so
15:13 there are people right now pulling their
15:15 hair out tell us where the flying
15:17 saucers are Tom what did you learn where
15:19 are they where are these aliens from
15:20 well number one there's there's multiple
15:24 different races it's not just one
15:26 specific kind and the different races
15:29 don't get along with each other and and
15:31 we don't really get along with them
15:33 either on and what
15:36 when we look at this is one of the
15:38 greatest things about Peter you have to
15:40 when I when I first start work with
15:42 Peter and you can tell with his
15:44 eloquence he he was able to put things
15:46 into words that I was able to use that
15:48 really got me in the door I mean I
15:49 remember and this will answer the
15:51 question I mean what you're what you're
15:52 saying because it's really it's a really
15:53 big long answer if I was to tell
15:56 everybody okay this is everything and
15:58 it's gonna it's going to take me
16:00 thousands of years to describe what's
16:02 happened over the past thousands of
16:04 years but I remember I used Peters words
16:06 of a cargo cult which is this idea that
16:09 it's on idea it's it's Peter why don't
16:12 you explain what a cargo cult is because
16:14 this is going to lead into how I used
16:17 those specific words about the cargo
16:18 cult and that was the trigger where
16:21 someone looked at me and said okay I'm
16:23 gonna introduce you to somebody and
16:25 that's where the door opened up and once
16:27 you start thinking about the cargo cult
16:29 you start going oh my god all the
16:31 world's religions are tied to this so
16:34 when people go well where's the alien
16:35 where's the Flying Saucer it's all about
16:37 the little no no no no it's all about
16:39 thousands of years of looking into the
16:41 sky and seeing something and and
16:44 creating different religions based on it
16:48 so Peter maybe you can explain the cargo
16:50 cult thing so that way I don't muck it
16:52 up too much we're going to a break in
16:54 two minutes so Peter take a whack in it
16:56 okay Cargill called uh these this this
16:59 kind of cult was discovered during World
17:01 War two for the most part in the South
17:03 Pacific Islands you had people living in
17:05 a Stone Age environment all that time
17:08 until world war ii broke out and on
17:11 their i'll their islands are being used
17:13 as supply depots and everything else so
17:15 people living in these villages would
17:17 suddenly see all these planes coming in
17:19 with people wearing these elaborate
17:21 uniforms and radio communications and
17:24 the planes would discourage all of these
17:26 boxes of medicine and food and all kinds
17:29 of good stuff and the people witnessing
17:31 this the Stone Age people living in that
17:33 kind of an environment are watching this
17:35 thing to the leaves of the jungles you
17:36 know and they're saying all we have to
17:39 do then is duplicate what these people
17:41 are doing we build ourselves an airstrip
17:43 we build ourselves a conning tower so
17:46 not a conic about our uh radio control
17:48 tower and air traffic control tower
17:50 we build ourselves kind of stuff that
17:52 looks like the stuff they're using and
17:54 maybe one of these planes will land here
17:56 and give us stuff basically they created
17:58 a religion around what they perceived as
18:02 the supernatural event and they saw it
18:04 as a supernatural event they didn't see
18:06 these people as people they didn't see
18:09 these machines as anything that was you
18:10 know man-made they saw this is some kind
18:12 of supernatural event that was taking
18:14 place and a religion sort of accreted
18:16 around it like barnacles on the hull of
18:18 a ship and basically that's what you
18:21 know from my perspective in the way we
18:22 were introducing it in gods and to the
18:24 in this book is that the the cargo cult
18:27 concept that theory is what is at the
18:30 root of not only our religions in the
18:33 world in general this religious impulse
18:35 it is based on that but also our science
18:38 and technology is part of that same
18:40 cargo cult we'll jump back into the big
18:43 themes the big picture with Tom DeLonge
18:46 and Peter La Venta talking about gods
18:48 man and war Bob Dylan takes us into the
18:50 break with a subterranean homesick blues
18:53 we all need a little of that saving
18:55 grace is the song from Tom Petty his
18:57 traveling companion or highway companion
19:00 album from 2006 great album underrated
19:03 we're talking with Tom DeLonge and Peter
19:05 l'amanda about their new book gods man
19:08 and war it's a UFO book without UFO
19:11 cases we're gonna explain why when we
19:13 come back here on coast-to-coast am in
19:15 this new book God's man and war an
19:18 official secret Machines investigation
19:20 of the UFO phenomenon there isn't a
19:23 whole heck of a lot of UFO cases in
19:25 there or incidents as Peter lavinda
19:27 mentioned a couple of minutes ago the
19:29 book starts with the premise that it's
19:31 already real we don't have to prove it
19:33 again we can we can start with that as
19:35 an as a place to open the discussion
19:37 Peter explained to me how wide of a net
19:41 you threw in pulling various threads
19:44 together as a way to explain the UFO
19:46 phenomenon in sort of a way it hadn't
19:48 been done before well in the first place
19:51 um but I was interested in doing was to
19:55 investigate the earliest textual
19:58 evidence we had from various um
20:01 civilization societies around the world
20:03 to see if there was evidence that there
20:06 were traces of a memory of an event that
20:09 they described in similar terms in other
20:12 words something coming from the sky or
20:14 something seen in the sky celestial
20:17 beings arcane powers that sort of thing
20:21 and try to see if there are any
20:22 similarities in their narratives going
20:25 across from one civilization to the next
20:27 just looking for trace evidence because
20:30 I felt that the these these people in
20:35 the ancient times people who just
20:37 developed writing and just we're just
20:38 beginning to write down experiences and
20:41 and what we sort of deprecatingly
20:44 referred to as their mythology that
20:47 they're actually referring to real
20:48 events there there's a kind of truism
20:51 when you study anthropology or you study
20:54 religion that first there's the event
20:56 and then there's the myth that explains
20:58 the event so the event is real you may
21:02 get different interpretations of it you
21:04 may get people struggling with trying to
21:07 explain what they saw or trying to
21:10 describe what they saw without even
21:12 explaining it but just even describing
21:13 it so there's a struggle that takes
21:16 place so if you look at all of these
21:18 various um scriptures and these ancient
21:21 uh forms of literature you can find
21:24 traces like that so my my initial
21:27 approach in God was to go very far
21:30 reaching was to look at some of the very
21:31 familiar subject matter that we have
21:34 biblical stuff in the West uh but then
21:37 to expand that out with looking at
21:39 ancient Sumer at Babylon looking at
21:41 ancient Egypt which is a very rich uh
21:43 place to start as well because they they
21:47 built an entire uh approach to burial
21:51 and to mortuary science let's put it
21:54 that way but with in with a view towards
21:57 immortality and actually traveling to
22:01 the stars the idea of building the
22:03 pyramids was to as one pair of ecologist
22:06 explained it a couple of years ago was
22:09 to create a resurrection machine you
22:11 know that's what the pyramids uh from
22:13 this point of view were intended to be
22:15 and is always oriented
22:17 starwort so the the opening of the mouth
22:20 ritual the mummification ceremonies were
22:22 all done with a view towards the soul
22:25 the essential nature of a human being is
22:28 somehow connected to the Stars
22:30 so the Egyptian is sort of very blatant
22:33 about it some of the others are not
22:34 quite so obvious but if you look at them
22:36 if you read the scriptures that they've
22:38 written you can see that there is the
22:39 same concept everything refers to heaven
22:42 as a place that is above the earth that
22:44 is someplace not necessarily contiguous
22:47 with the earth but it's there it's a
22:49 celestial homeland so starting with that
22:52 concept I developed this idea from
22:55 reading all of this that there must have
22:56 been a point of contact in the distant
23:01 past
23:02 we as Homo sapiens were traveling on
23:04 this planet for a couple of hundred
23:06 thousand years before suddenly at some
23:09 point about Oh fifteen thousand years
23:11 ago or so we all decided around the
23:14 world to start developing civilizations
23:15 and we all started to you know building
23:18 pyramids for some reason there's
23:19 pyramids in China and pyramids in Egypt
23:21 and pyramids in Central America so you
23:23 have you have this idea that we're doing
23:26 something we're building structures that
23:28 are astronomically oriented we're
23:31 developing civilization we're developing
23:33 cities we're using our resources to
23:35 build these elaborate temples and why
23:39 are we doing this and then I saw
23:41 parallels today you know our science is
23:44 doing the same thing we're expending
23:46 money and resources and focus on going
23:49 to the stars
23:50 just as our ancient ancestors did in
23:53 building their so-called resurrection
23:55 machines the idea being you know all
23:57 these are all of these early
23:59 civilizations the Sumerians and
24:01 Babylonians and Aztecs and they're all
24:04 sort of mimicking something that they
24:06 have actually seen it's not a
24:08 coincidence just like a cargo cult
24:10 exactly they're mimicking something that
24:12 they saw and they're trying to duplicate
24:15 it and they're trying to get back to
24:16 that state whatever that was we keep
24:19 yearning towards that moment when this
24:21 contact happened and what's happening
24:23 now is that after thousands of years of
24:26 religion dominating that conversation
24:28 we've moved into science
24:30 dominate
24:30 the conversation going to the stars and
24:32 from my perspective as will develop in
24:35 the later books I believe that both of
24:38 these things considered separately are
24:40 not enough but considered together will
24:43 give us the key to understanding the
24:44 phenomenon and I think that's where what
24:47 we're close to doing now the idea of
24:49 disclosure requires not only somebody
24:52 coming out and saying yeah you know
24:53 flying saucers a real little green men
24:55 areal disclosure requires us to be sort
25:00 of reverse-engineered you know it
25:02 requires our consciousness to to get to
25:04 the point where we can understand these
25:06 concepts now that we can actually see
25:08 what it is we're talking about and we
25:10 can approach it more safely and I think
25:13 that's what's stopping us and we're
25:14 seeing the clues and Tom has seen them
25:16 and he's communicated these things to me
25:18 as well we've had long conversations
25:19 about this is that we're at the writers
25:22 stage of being able to understand what
25:24 this is and it's not what we think it is
25:27 I think that's the important takeaway
25:29 from this it's not what we think it is
25:31 what we think it is you know is the
25:33 result of all of these accretions of all
25:35 of these ideas that have gone on before
25:36 and all these various religious things
25:39 get you know mixed up ideology screws
25:41 this up a great deal if we can strip the
25:43 ideology out and only talk to the
25:46 Mystics and only talk to the shamans
25:48 we'll get a closer idea as to what this
25:51 is and the other ology is the other
25:54 ology is ufology Tom when you started
25:56 down this path
25:57 I'm as for me and probably for Peter as
26:00 well the prevailing view is UFOs lights
26:04 in the sky craft from other planets
26:07 they're here visiting us checking out us
26:09 out that's not the that's not what
26:11 you're looking at now at all you you I
26:13 know I mentioned about the meaning with
26:15 Jacques Vallee who has always sort of
26:18 had the idea that it's too simple of an
26:20 explanation that the ultimate big
26:22 picture is much more complicated and
26:24 wondrous that's where you are now right
26:28 is down there guy I think the universe
26:32 is so big and there's so much going on
26:34 in it that almost anything is possible
26:37 you know is there is there a dimensional
26:39 thing uh that's going on probably and is
26:44 that another intelligence probably are
26:46 there people coming here from other
26:48 planets probably you know it just goes
26:50 on and on I do know that one of the
26:53 things that gets really confusing for
26:55 people is uh you know orbs now these
26:59 little balls of light that come in if
27:01 you if you're watching Discovery Channel
27:03 you think that these are ghosts and they
27:05 have them on ghost hunters and all that
27:07 kind of those shows and like they'll
27:08 have camera footage of an orb that goes
27:10 down the hallway of a haunted house or
27:13 or a hospital when someone dies but
27:16 those same orbs could do some pretty
27:18 funky things to people that see UFOs all
27:20 the time you know the Lords can show up
27:22 and tear someone's cancer I know
27:25 somebody who had his cancer cured by
27:27 that and I've actually seen all the the
27:30 videos and photos of the orbs in his
27:32 backyard because he's being studied
27:34 right now from various places and these
27:36 orbs will do some tricky stuff they make
27:38 him feel that it's all religious so to
27:41 this guy it's all about Christianity and
27:43 he's just like thank you lord I thank
27:46 you Jesus and I'm so blessed that these
27:49 these lights are here now those same
27:52 orbs are projecting Holograms of grey
27:55 aliens a little ones of the big black
27:57 eyes I call them bugs uh in your kind of
28:01 going okay so why is why are these orbs
28:03 showing up and downloading into this
28:06 guy's head when he's in his living room
28:08 go get your camera and come out to the
28:10 backyard and then it does a song and
28:12 dance for him maybe it shows an alien
28:15 maybe it cures him or his friend they
28:18 brought other people over they got cured
28:19 for cancer you know in a but then then
28:21 there's this this this whole it's like
28:23 this big religious experience and it's
28:24 all good but it's all kind of confusing
28:26 and then on the other side of the world
28:28 these orbs are showing up and they're
28:29 doing really really bad stuff to people
28:32 and there is no good about it there is
28:34 no happy uh like a Christian tale so
28:38 it's it's you know what is the
28:40 phenomenon well it's a lot of different
28:43 things it's kind of all the above you
28:44 know is there a craft in the sky that's
28:46 controlling these plasma balls of light
28:48 and their little drones and they're
28:50 meant to confuse you and they're made to
28:51 make you feel like it's all hunky-dory
28:53 you know but I don't I don't know the
28:56 answers to all that stuff
28:57 I think um it's just not simple you know
29:01 it's just not simple and it's like
29:03 taking an iPhone and putting it in front
29:05 of a cow and asking the cow if he knows
29:07 everything about the iPhone yeah maybe
29:10 the cow knows it's a phone but doesn't
29:12 know anything about all the other things
29:13 it does I have no idea well let me ask
29:15 you it's sort of in a direct way have
29:17 you been told that that there are
29:19 visitors from elsewhere either
29:21 dimensional or other planets or both yes
29:24 they are intervening in human affairs
29:26 have you been told that sort of directly
29:28 absolutely yes and let me let me expand
29:33 upon that you know a lot of this a lot
29:37 of a lot that means I always got to
29:41 think about how I say these things
29:42 there's a lot of things that I can't say
29:44 but there's when we tie some of the
29:47 others to mythology one of the things I
29:51 was hammered into me was specifically um
29:54 you know that God's intervening and
29:57 human events at a time and at times
30:01 where there's industrialized warfare and
30:04 trying to help different sides and
30:07 because there's a political means to the
30:10 to the industrialized warfare so it's
30:12 it's taking sides God's taking sides and
30:15 Peter I mean it you know hit one of the
30:18 reasons I loved working with him was he
30:20 had such a great understanding and a
30:22 large really large understanding about
30:26 God's intervening in human affairs in
30:30 antiquity and all of our all of the
30:33 ancient texts are are just littered with
30:37 with the gods helping one side against
30:39 the other well and and being at war with
30:42 each other
30:42 Peter that's an important theme that you
30:44 develop in great detail in this book
30:46 about the gods being at war with each
30:48 other using various skullduggery and
30:51 weaponry and and and it seems like it's
30:54 for control of the planet or of us is
30:57 that your is that your contention well I
31:00 think that some of that plays out here I
31:03 think that our we've witnessed it in in
31:05 dim antiquity we've witnessed something
31:08 of that nature it scared us tremendously
31:10 and we
31:11 chose sides you know or we thought this
31:14 side was probably better than the other
31:15 side or maybe one side had dominated and
31:18 another side was the the oppress the
31:19 aggressor I mean it's really hard to
31:22 come up with modern-day contemporary
31:24 viewpoints on this we have to go back to
31:26 understanding you know how they saw what
31:29 was happening people who were not
31:31 technologically advanced like like the
31:34 cargo cults are witnessing a struggle
31:36 the people of the cargo cults the real
31:38 cargo cults in in the South Pacific
31:40 we're witnessing exactly that they were
31:43 witnessing the Japanese fighting the the
31:45 British and the Americans in in the
31:47 Pacific during World War two
31:48 so they saw that there were two opposing
31:51 groups fighting each other right so they
31:54 they incorporated that you know to some
31:56 extent in in their histories and in
31:59 their belief systems this idea that
32:01 there was kind of a struggle that there
32:02 were you know fascinating weapons and
32:04 the ability to fly over the planet and
32:06 do all sorts of things I mean imagine
32:08 what that must look like to a Stone Age
32:10 civilization so in the book though you
32:12 make what we're going on right the
32:16 argument being in the book there are
32:18 numerous examples of ancient
32:19 civilizations that are describing wars
32:22 between gods
32:23 there's scripture there's carvings and
32:26 petroglyphs and things of that sort you
32:28 think that there is there at least some
32:31 of these that need to be taken literally
32:32 I think so literally to the extent that
32:35 there something was taking place and it
32:37 was not human in the sense that we
32:40 understand it or else they would have
32:41 described it that way there's certainly
32:42 enough things in the Bible that describe
32:44 you know tribes fighting tribes for
32:46 instance uh there's no hint of you know
32:48 necessarily there being any supernatural
32:50 component to that but if we go back to
32:53 Genesis 6 as an example and there you
32:56 have the sons of God and the daughters
32:57 of men you know and so what does that
33:00 mean you know that's one of those
33:02 phrases that sections of the Bible that
33:04 nobody really understands and can
33:07 convince me if they understand it
33:08 you have something called the sons of
33:10 God the bene Elohim and you have the
33:13 daughters of men and the sons of God
33:15 think the daughters of men are really
33:16 cute and they go and cohabit with them
33:18 and they have children and it appears
33:20 that these children are sort of genetic
33:23 monstrosities of some kind
33:25 because they're called the Giants which
33:27 is one way of interpreting the term
33:29 Nephilim so you have this happens and
33:32 then immediately I mean in the Bible of
33:35 Genesis 6 after this description of the
33:37 sons of God and the daughters of men God
33:39 gets very upset with human race and
33:41 decides he's going to destroy the whole
33:42 planet and that's where that introduces
33:45 the story of Noah so there's this
33:47 bizarre segue that you go from some
33:50 beings that we don't know that are
33:53 obviously not human because we're
33:56 emphasizing daughters of men and the
33:59 sons of God and why would the sons of
34:02 God be evil right why would why would
34:06 God be upset with his own sons if this
34:08 was the case it didn't seem to be the
34:10 case you know the sons of God were the
34:13 way that they had to describe
34:15 otherworldly non-human beings who were
34:18 actually cohabiting with human women and
34:23 then giving birth to basically hybrids
34:25 right so you have the David and Goliath
34:27 you know thing that happens later and
34:29 Goliath is one of these monstrous beings
34:31 that was created that was not destroyed
34:34 during the flood but which actually
34:35 survived the flood even according to the
34:37 Bible so when you look at events like
34:39 that you think in terms of you know well
34:41 we learn about Greek mythology in school
34:43 it's all nonsense well no they're
34:46 describing they're attempting to
34:47 describe things that actually happened
34:49 using the terminology they had the
34:52 language skills they had and the context
34:54 that they had so they are describing you
34:57 know conflicts that took place for which
34:59 they have no earthly counterpart Tom you
35:03 start casually asking your advisors
35:05 questions sort of feeling your way along
35:08 not wanting to push it too far but you
35:10 asked one of them in particular and I
35:12 hope you can talk about this I think you
35:14 can as a there's a reference in the book
35:17 some question and he gives you the
35:19 answer instead of him telling you yeah
35:21 we've got the flying saucers - deri 51 35:24 or it's the reptilian race from the
35:26 planet serpo or something he tells you
35:29 to take a look at greek mythology that's
35:31 not what you were expecting to hear oh
35:32 my gosh you know the the I was it was
35:35 not only was it not what I was expecting
35:37 to hear
35:38 uh it was told to me three different
35:40 times from different different people at
35:46 that at those levels and I missed it I
35:50 missed it the first time and then it was
35:52 brought up the second time and then my
35:54 heart sank because I go oh my god I was
35:56 so dumb I missed it the first time or
35:58 when it was said to me and then I flew
36:00 across the country and had a chance to
36:03 meet somebody that was of the highest
36:09 ranks and multiple places in the
36:12 government and right when I sit down and
36:15 I have a chance to bring this person on
36:17 board I'm in there very modestly just
36:21 saying okay sir let me explain to you
36:23 what it is I'm attempting to do and he
36:26 stops me and he goes when I was a kid I
36:28 used to read a lot of Greek mythology
36:30 and he just stares at me I'm like oh my
36:33 god here it is again you know and uh and
36:35 it's it's all it all it all goes back to
36:39 that but I but I really do think that's
36:41 about one particular race it's not about
36:44 all of them there are multiple races I
36:47 think when it comes down to the Greek
36:49 mythology I I had to get some
36:52 clarification on that and it's exactly
36:54 as I described earlier in what Peter
36:58 gets into in the in the terms of these
37:00 gods are intervening in human affairs
37:02 but at that point in time during ancient
37:05 Greek times that's really when they made
37:08 themselves visibly known potentially for
37:12 the first time they've been doing it
37:14 long before that but I I add that at
37:17 that moment it seems as though they were
37:20 really visible and and that's when we
37:23 got you know the the Greek alphabet
37:25 that's when we got you know the
37:27 democracy stuff and that's when we got
37:29 the architecture and that's why if you
37:31 look at Washington DC the architecture
37:33 is very similar it's in western in the
37:36 western world you know we've been living
37:39 off of the information that this
37:42 intelligence has been giving us as they
37:46 hop up from time to time and sorry to
37:48 intervene right there but we need to
37:49 take a break that's a really important
37:51 point then we're going to pick
37:52 on the other side we're talking with Tom
37:55 DeLonge and Peter lavinda about God's
37:57 man and war
37:59 we have an early classic of surf rock
38:01 guitar take us into the break

00:00 this is an honor for me I just told how
00:03 that when mine reach came out he
00:05 seriously screwed up my life I read this
00:09 I said Oh give me a break
00:10 and so I set up a beautiful double-blind
00:13 study with a friend of mine cross
00:15 country didn't tell anybody about it and
00:17 damn it's his fault this certificate
00:25 says Tim Dinsdale Memorial Award
00:28 recognizing significant contributions to
00:30 the expansion of human understanding
00:32 through the study of unexplained
00:34 phenomena and more specifically to how
00:37 put off it says Harold for the
00:40 application of sound scientific
00:42 principles and methodologies to the
00:44 study of remote perception quantum zero
00:46 point fluctuations and unidentified
00:49 aerial objects and for realizing the
00:52 potential usefulness of these often
00:54 shunned phenomena in the real world to
00:58 hell
01:13 I'm very honored to receive this award
01:16 I've known many of the previous
01:18 recipients of the dennis dale award over
01:20 the years and they were all really truly
01:23 excellent researchers pushing the
01:27 boundaries into the frontier areas of
01:29 science so to join their ranks i
01:31 consider really quite a privilege the
01:35 three areas that he named and giving me
01:37 the award quantum vacuum fluctuations i
01:40 actually i still published in that area
01:43 in physics journals
01:44 the second area remote viewing in fact
01:48 it's very serendipitous that i should
01:51 receive this award for this particular
01:53 meeting since we have this co-sponsored
01:55 event with society for scientific
01:58 scientific exploration on one hand and
02:01 irva international reviewers association
02:04 on the other i was a founding member of
02:07 a bus
02:07 i'm really excited to see how people
02:10 have picked up the ball and run with it
02:12 in that area the third area unidentified
02:16 aerial phenomena i have not published
02:19 anything in why because the program i
02:23 was involved in in the pentagon and in
02:26 the intelligence community has been
02:28 top-secret behind the scenes and only
02:32 recently has there been release of
02:36 information about the program and so
02:39 this is the first chance that i've had a
02:41 chance to actually appear before the
02:44 public and speak about details of the
02:47 program and not go to jail so i'm gonna
02:50 go along at a rapid clip i've got a lot
02:52 of information here so here we go the
02:58 SSE is no stranger to the subject of
03:00 UFOs
03:02 unidentified aerial phenomena just a new
03:04 acronym for ufos back a couple of
03:08 decades ago peter Sturrock one of our
03:10 founding members of sse arranged with
03:15 [Music]
03:17 Rockefeller to hold a week-long workshop
03:23 at the Rockefeller residence we brought
03:28 in the best of the UFO researchers and
03:31 then a panel of independent experts and
03:34 had a week-long discussion of physical
03:38 evidence related to UFO objects of which
03:41 there there's a significant amount of
03:43 data and Laurance Rockefeller has hosted
03:47 the whole thing it was a wonderful
03:48 meeting eventually after publishing in
03:53 the SSE journal Peter Sturrock put
03:57 together a book the UFO enigma and it is
04:00 still one of the best books you can find
04:02 out there to take a look at what are the
04:05 physical aspects of UFOs that
04:09 researchers have uncovered however of
04:14 course the government also is no
04:15 stranger to the UFO phenomena anyone who
04:19 follows the field would be familiar with
04:21 project sine grudge and Blue Book but in
04:24 1969 the Condon committee shut it all
04:28 down and said really we don't need to be
04:31 involved in this area anymore we're not
04:34 learning anything we're not getting
04:35 anywhere it's not clear that this is a
04:38 significant area and so for the average
04:41 person on the street that's when it all
04:44 kind of ended at least serious
04:46 government interest in fact that's not
04:48 true
04:50 the very memo that shut down blue book
04:54 written by general bolander had as part
04:58 of its language reports of UFOs which
05:01 could affect national security would
05:03 continue to be handled through the
05:05 standard Air Force procedures designed
05:07 for this purpose nonetheless as far as
05:11 the public was concerned that was it
05:13 I mean the Air Force Public Affairs
05:16 Office put out circulars all the time in
05:20 response to questions saying no while we
05:22 gave this up in 1969 what in fact did
05:27 occur was that there were programs going
05:29 on behind the scenes
05:30 anyway as required by the Belinda
05:33 mineral now most people didn't know
05:35 about these programs they weren't
05:37 advertised they weren't responded to fo
05:40 a requests usually went dry but that all
05:44 changed last December when the New York
05:48 Times published a front-page story on
05:51 how there was this program investigating
05:56 this area advanced aerospace threat
05:59 identification program it was deeply
06:02 buried but New York Times had good
06:05 sources and they came up with
06:07 information about the program and so
06:09 there's been a lot of publicity about it
06:12 since the New York Times broke the story
06:16 Washington Post CNN Fox News it's been
06:19 picked up all over the place and one of
06:24 the reasons why it's attracted attention
06:25 at this point are the quality of the
06:28 sources going public X Senate Majority
06:32 Leader Harry Reid is the one who
06:34 initiated the program top rate at f-18 06:38 pilots who encountered advanced
06:39 aerospace vehicles at close range
06:41 were permitted to come forward and tell
06:44 their stories which up till now they
06:47 hadn't because they didn't want to lose
06:48 their flight status by reporting what
06:51 they had found at least publicly a
06:54 number of significant Department of
06:56 Defense and intelligence community
06:57 officials have come forward to talk
07:00 about the reality of this phenomenon and
07:03 the fact that there were programs going
07:04 on the program was nicknamed advanced
07:09 aerospace threat identification program
07:12 a tip people who have trouble trying to
07:17 get documents out of the Pentagon by
07:19 saying they want all documents and a tip
07:21 and they have a hard time because that
07:23 wasn't actually the name of the program
07:24 that top name there is the actual name
07:27 of the program but a tip was with the
07:29 nicknames and it went by
07:32 it began in June of 2007 defense
07:38 intelligence agency was concerned about
07:40 the fact that obvious observation had
07:43 shown
07:43 Advanced aerospace vehicles crafts of
07:46 drones of unknown origin we're flying
07:49 all over the United States over waters
07:52 in fact globally is a case and so a
07:57 congressional budget was approved to
07:58 address the issue behind the scenes
08:01 senator Majority Senate Majority Leader
08:04 Harry Reid from Nevada was the one who
08:06 was the initiator of the program joined
08:10 by Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens
08:13 these are the people who generally
08:15 approved programs that were in the black
08:18 under high security behind the scenes
08:21 and so they set up this program Senator
08:28 Reid has not walked this back since all
08:30 the news came out he's been very
08:32 forthright and given a number of
08:33 interviews this particular statement
08:35 sort of captures it all we don't know
08:38 the answers but we have plenty of
08:40 evidence to support the questions this
08:43 is about science and national security
08:45 if America doesn't take a lead answering
08:47 these questions others will well there's
08:52 a two-fold nature of the threat first of
08:55 all you've got these advanced aerospace
08:57 vehicles flying around that we don't
08:59 know where they come from
09:00 who's driving them what the intent is
09:05 possibly offworld even but the future
09:09 threat was actually as far as a
09:11 department fence went and the
09:13 intelligence community one of the
09:15 greater concerns what happens in
09:18 potential adversaries achieve
09:22 significant breakthroughs by getting
09:23 hold of advanced technology either based
09:28 on their study of the phenomena or from
09:31 sensor data or crash retrieve materials
09:33 then that could provide a problem for
09:35 the United States and the sense of
09:38 threat and there's reason to be
09:42 concerned about that this is a document
09:44 in the program we dug up out of the
09:46 Soviet Union it's a very thick document
09:48 it shows that the Soviet Union had a
09:51 massive program also trying to get to
09:54 the root of all of this
09:56 and in this document a number of
09:58 research institutes and military
09:59 institutes are listed and of course they
10:03 had the same concerns we did is there
10:05 threat from the phenomena or might the
10:09 Americans make headway before us and
10:12 that be a threat just to give you an
10:17 idea of what's being observed which many
10:20 a people seen because it's been in the
10:22 news a lot lately back in November of
10:25 2004 a Nimitz carrier group was out on
10:30 patrol off of San Diego and in several
10:34 occasions an advanced aerospace vehicle
10:37 would descend rapidly from 60,000 feet
10:40 to 50 feet in seconds and then hover and
10:44 then take off like a boy when it first
10:51 happened and happened over a number of
10:53 weeks actually two f-18 I'll talk about
10:56 two f-18 pilots were vectored unto the
11:00 site where this they were being observed
11:03 by the radars to investigate and what
11:08 they saw was what they call the tic-tac
11:10 craft solid white smooth no edges about
11:17 forty six feet in length uniformly
11:21 colored known as cells pylons and wings
11:25 the f-18s could not obtain lock with
11:28 their radars because they were stealthy
11:31 but forward-looking infrared radar could
11:35 pick them up to some degree based on
11:38 their heat signatures and the advanced
11:42 service phase vehicle appeared to
11:43 demonstrate advanced acceleration
11:45 aerodynamic and propulsion capability
11:47 beyond anything that that we knew
11:50 existed on the planet I'm going to play
11:54 Fleur video that many of you may have
11:57 seen
12:03 got sound with the video do you have
12:10 [Music]
12:30 that's not us though is it for something
12:36 it's rotated gonna play one more time
12:54 there's a hole clean up what the man
12:57 said but all going against the window
13:03 into high school playing oh oh
13:25 you might ask yourself well like what
13:27 can you prove from from a videotape I
13:29 mean you can see videotapes all over the
13:31 internet and so on but this was data
13:33 fusion their gun camera tapes they're
13:36 these videotapes from the pilots voice
13:38 recordings data link recordings from
13:41 ages and many other military platforms
13:44 expert witnesses so in fact the data
13:48 density and this is what's changed the
13:51 field a lot our detection capability has
13:54 gotten so advanced that we're losing our
13:57 inability to see exactly what's going on
14:02 the FLIR displays were recorded their
14:06 detailed debriefs of the pilots in that
14:09 original New York Times article you can
14:10 see a page long debrief of de flavor
14:14 oops
14:17 key assessments the advanced aerospace
14:21 vehicle the vehicle has no known air
14:24 vehicle in the inventory of the US or
14:26 foreign nation as far as we can tell
14:29 low observable characteristics are
14:31 stealthy the exhibit advanced
14:35 aerodynamic performance that we can't
14:38 imagine how they do it
14:39 and recognize that these are infrared
14:41 tapes from the pilots so if there was
14:44 some kind of hot propulsion gases coming
14:46 out the back you would have seen it yeah
14:52 the advanced capability to remain
14:54 stationary and then take off like a shot
14:56 Dave favore says was like somebody
14:59 suddenly shot a bullet so how do we
15:05 respond to this the Defense Intelligence
15:06 Agency put out a broad area announcement
15:08 in fact it was unclassified they wanted
15:11 to evaluate twelve potential threat
15:13 areas with regard to these advanced
15:15 aerospace vehicles there's a list of
15:17 them exactly what you would think you'd
15:20 want to know
15:21 live propulsion signature reduction in
15:24 human effects and so on
15:28 you know it turned out that anyone any
15:31 Aerospace Corporation could could apply
15:33 could send in a proposal DIA chose Big O
15:36 of aerospace as a contractor to address
15:38 the threat now there's been buzz on the
15:41 internet about okay well Senator Reid
15:43 came from Nevada and Bigelow Aerospace
15:45 is in Nevada so wasn't is just some
15:48 sweetheart deal in fact that's not the
15:50 case it was a broad area announcement
15:53 anybody could go for it
15:54 Bigelow was actually a good choice he'd
15:57 spent a lot of his own money because
15:58 he's interested in this area up to this
16:00 point investigating the the phenomena
16:03 and he had the best proposal and so he
16:08 was tasked and so he set up a special
16:10 organization called Bigelow Aerospace
16:11 advanced Space Studies so we we call it
16:14 bass to do all the things you'd expect
16:17 the program like this to do well bass
16:21 connected contacted me at Arctic
16:24 international to collaborate as a
16:26 subcontractor and I agreed to do that
16:31 okay what did I address as a
16:33 subcontractor well one of the critical
16:35 issues is that there's so much
16:37 high-level security and
16:39 compartmentalization in this subject
16:40 area and there's a lot of it is
16:43 difficult for contractors to obtain
16:46 expert opinions on advanced technologies
16:49 because they would expose why they were
16:52 interested so I acted as a surrogate I
16:56 was contracted to Commission mostly
17:00 unclassified white papers from experts
17:02 around the globe where their particular
17:05 aerospace related subject areas would be
17:07 in 2050 as like a general survey of
17:10 aerospace futures I decide this would be
17:13 the best way to get the best knowledge
17:15 we had across many technologies without
17:18 actually exposing why we wanted to know
17:21 so I let out 38 contracts over a
17:25 two-year period I'll show you what the
17:29 studies were on you can read them
17:32 they're positron and aerospace
17:35 propulsion IEC fusion as a compact
17:38 energy source work drive
17:40 work energy extra dimensions metallic
17:43 glasses for aerospace use really
17:45 cutting-edge kinds of things here's some
17:49 more of the papers that I commissioned
17:51 negative mass propulsion antigravity for
17:54 aerospace applications and so on
17:59 programmable matter invisibility cloak
18:03 II these are just the kind of things
18:06 that we needed to have maximum technical
18:09 input from the best people around the
18:11 globe that's what we did that's what I
18:13 did
18:14 now we could--we we told these people
18:16 they could publish their reports and
18:19 physics journals and engineering
18:21 journals but of course the contractor
18:23 didn't want to wait for that so the
18:25 Defense Intelligence Agency bundled up
18:27 these 38 papers and put them out as
18:30 Defense Intelligence reference documents
18:32 posted on a jwilks
18:35 server that anyone in the government or
18:39 contractors could get access to by and
18:42 large they have not been released and to
18:45 the public yet a couple of leaked at so
18:50 let me give you an example of well how
18:53 does this stuff help people who are
18:55 chasing these really difficult problems
18:58 I'm choosing one here many materials for
19:01 aerospace use I'd love to talk about
19:03 really fancy materials but they're
19:07 classified however there's a lot of
19:10 materials that have been picked up or
19:13 provided even in the public domain I'm
19:16 gonna give an example because it shows
19:18 exactly what this structure is for how
19:20 to deal with this this is an open source
19:23 sample it was sent anonymously to
19:28 talk-show host art Bell the fellow
19:31 claimed to be in the military he said
19:34 that this sample was picked up in a
19:36 crash retrieval and so he sent it by
19:38 email so what does that mean
19:40 chain-of-custody non-existent provenance
19:44 questionable could be a hoax it could be
19:49 some slag off of some foundry floor or
19:51 whatever however
19:54 it was an unusual sample so we decided
19:57 to take a look at it it was a
20:01 multi-layered bismuth and magnesium
20:04 sample bismuth layers less than a human
20:07 hair
20:07 magnesium samples about ten times the
20:10 size of a human hair supposedly picked
20:13 up in the crash retrieval of an advanced
20:16 aerospace vehicle looks like it's been
20:20 in a crash the white lines are the
20:23 bismuth the darker areas are the
20:26 magnesium separations so the question
20:31 was what about this material so
20:33 naturally we looked in all of the
20:35 National Labs we talked to metallurgist
20:38 we combed the entire structure of
20:41 published papers no where could we find
20:44 any evidence that anybody ever made one
20:46 of these secondly some attempts were
20:50 made to try to reproduce this material
20:53 but they couldn't get the bismuth and
20:55 magnesium layers to bond thirdly when we
20:59 talked to people who in the materials
21:02 field who should know they said we don't
21:04 know why anybody would want to make
21:06 anything like this it's not obvious that
21:08 it has any function well years later
21:15 decades later actually finally our own
21:18 science moves along we move into an area
21:21 called metamaterials and it turns out
21:24 that exactly this combination of
21:26 materials at exactly those dimensions
21:30 turn out to be an excellent microscopic
21:34 waveguide for very high frequency
21:37 electromagnetic radiation terahertz
21:38 frequencies so the wavelength is 60 21:47 microns which is pretty small size but
21:50 it turns out that because of the
21:52 metamaterial aspect of this
21:55 material those bismuth layers that act
21:59 as waveguides can be one twentieth the
22:02 size of the wavelength and usually when
22:04 you make a waveguide it's got to be
22:06 about the size of the wavelength so in
22:08 fact this turned out to be a material
22:11 that would propagate sub-wavelength
22:12 we've got effects why somebody wants to
22:16 do that we don't know the answer to that
22:18 but anyway it was amazing that we've
22:20 gone through this and this is the kind
22:22 of structure we go through a lot you get
22:25 a material sample than usual
22:26 characteristics to be evaluated the
22:29 method of manufacture difficult to
22:31 assess or reproduce the purpose of the
22:34 function is not readily apparent as with
22:38 our sample here and then as our own
22:40 technical knowledge moves forward we
22:43 finally see a possible purpose of
22:46 function comes to light that sequence is
22:49 repeated over and over in this
22:51 particular area I'll pick a second one
22:55 here for the engineers of physicists in
22:59 the crowd probably be more interesting
23:01 spacetime metric engineering this
23:03 happened to be the paper that I myself
23:05 provided one of the questions is can the
23:10 reported anomalous observables of these
23:13 advanced aerospace vehicles be accounted
23:15 for in the basis of known physics I mean
23:18 you hear people describing craft taking
23:21 right angle turns at high speeds and
23:24 other things with the hovering and rapid
23:29 acceleration and so on as if the craft
23:32 didn't have any inertial mass well it
23:35 turns out although general relativity
23:38 Einstein's general relativity is usually
23:39 used in Astrophysical applications and
23:42 gravity studies and so on you can look
23:45 at it from an engineering standpoint so
23:47 if you take an engineering approach to
23:49 general relativity what I just showed
23:52 can be can be understood if you could
23:56 change the space-time metric the way
23:57 general relativity I'm talking about
23:59 text book not some fanciful physics you
24:02 could even get faster than light travel
24:04 Alcubierre warp drive warp drive
24:07 as in Star Trek again you might think
24:10 that's a fanciful kind of thing but that
24:12 paper was published in one of the top
24:14 general relativity journals classical
24:16 corner gravity the warp drive hyper fast
24:19 travel within general relativity so if
24:23 you engineer space-time metric you can
24:26 begin to line up observables with
24:29 physics that we know and love even if we
24:31 can't reproduce it what about the
24:35 velocity of light constraint people are
24:37 always saying that you know how could
24:40 you have a wormhole you let you go from
24:41 one side of the university of the other
24:43 aren't you beating the speed of light
24:45 well what does the physicist and
24:47 engineer mean by the speed of light he
24:49 means this little equation here with
24:54 speed of light it's given by 1 over the
24:57 square root of the permittivity times
24:58 the permeability of the vacuum so the
25:01 point is if you re-engineer those vacuum
25:04 parameters then you can make the
25:06 effective speed of light higher in the
25:08 engineered region and so those are the
25:11 solution and general relativity that are
25:13 called wormholes and again it's not
25:15 science fiction this is just right off
25:17 the shelf standard textbook general
25:22 relativity applications so what that
25:25 means is the reduced in time
25:27 interstellar travel it's not as skeptics
25:30 would say you can't get from there to
25:31 here advanced CT civilizations now
25:35 ourselves in the future and not
25:37 fundamentally constrained by physical
25:39 principles the exotic physics for such
25:42 can be addressed in engineering terms
25:44 sort of metric engineering as it were
25:47 does this have any help again by the way
25:50 this paper also was published as one of
25:53 the Defense Intelligence reference
25:55 documents and since we are permitted to
25:59 publish in the open literature I
26:02 published that paper in a British
26:06 interplanetary science journal
26:08 so if you're interested in looking at
26:10 the details you can get learn as much as
26:12 you want to know about metric
26:14 engineering and that helped us
26:21 understand some of the aspects I mean
26:23 you may have heard the phrase dense
26:25 stars you get redshift well it turns out
26:28 in this engineer technology you get
26:30 so-called blue shift that is frequencies
26:33 are up shifted to higher frequencies so
26:37 for example in this room so for example
26:41 in this room most of the radiation
26:43 coming off our bodies off the walls and
26:51 what we see things in the visible range
26:54 but what happens if you get into a
26:57 volume of space where the vacuum has
26:59 been engineered and the way I've been
27:01 discussing it turns out to get a blue
27:03 shift so in fact the infrared you don't
27:07 ordinarily see can get blue shifted up
27:09 into the visible so it's not surprising
27:11 that all these craft should be so
27:13 luminous now the downside from all of
27:16 this is the fact that visible light
27:18 which doesn't have any particularly
27:21 harmful effects gets blue shifted up
27:24 into the ultraviolet so we get too close
27:29 to Atlantic craft you might get a
27:31 sunburn or off into the soft x-ray
27:35 region so the chance of radiation
27:37 poisoning so if you run across one of
27:41 these sitting on the ground I would
27:42 recommend you don't and it's powered up
27:44 I'd recommend you don't rush up and well
27:48 that helped us to understand we as part
27:51 of this program we looked at some cases
27:53 that are really good from Brazil 77 78 27:58 it was like Close Encounters of the
28:00 Third Kind thousand pages of documents
28:04 all done by the Brazilian Air Force
28:05 investigative team 500 photographs 15 28:09 hours of motion film a lot of medical
28:11 injuries I know you probably can't read
28:16 that from here but it's just a list of
28:18 the different kinds of medical injuries
28:19 that
28:20 when people encounter these craft at
28:24 close range and it has some overlap with
28:27 cases that we've investigated during the
28:30 program of injuries occurring well
28:35 despite the progress in the ATF program
28:37 let's face it topic is inherently
28:39 anomalous right therefore despite the
28:46 reality of the observations and all the
28:49 people that we interact with in the
28:50 intelligence community and the Pentagon
28:53 agree the data is there it's it's real
28:56 nonetheless the topic doesn't fit
28:58 smoothly into known profiles of
29:01 government programs for sure and by
29:04 virtual natural security implications
29:06 it's high compartmentalization of topic
29:09 therefore a slow pace of cumulative
29:12 progress and integration we call them
29:14 stovepipes you have a lot of people with
29:16 lots of detailed information about some
29:19 particular aspect but they don't talk to
29:21 each other even it's sitting at the next
29:24 desk and let's face it advocacy of the
29:29 issue in government circles is not
29:31 viewed as a career enhancing in part
29:36 because despite the weirdness of the
29:39 subject if you don't make a lot of
29:42 progress you know it doesn't look good
29:44 on your resume that you're moving up the
29:46 line so because of that there's a
29:51 forward story many of us involved in the
29:55 program decided that there should be an
29:57 outreach program in the public sector so
30:01 this is the forward story the goal was
30:04 established a broad base high quality
30:06 scientific community of interest in the
30:09 public sector concerning these
30:11 unidentified aerial phenomena and other
30:14 related leading-edge topics and so we
30:19 got together and formed a company called
30:21 to the stars Academy of Arts and Science
30:25 it was co-founded by entrepreneur Tom
30:28 DeLonge I'll talk about him in a minute
30:31 senior intelligence officers from
30:33 Department defense and CIA and
30:35 distinguished research scientists we all
30:38 banded together to form this Academy it
30:43 was set up as a public benefit
30:45 corporation so the public can invest and
30:48 therefore it's owned by the public so
30:52 this is something new
30:53 whatever comes out of any of the
30:55 research or any of the release of
30:57 information is actually going to be
30:59 owned by the public it's not going to
31:00 disappear into a black hole
31:03 very transparent structure if you go to
31:05 the website you can see everything from
31:08 the financial structure to the
31:11 activities and we do have a web-based
31:14 community of interest where things get
31:16 posted for example those this f-18 flare
31:22 tape I show we now have three of them up
31:24 there probably more to come all right
31:30 well who was the principles of this
31:31 organization Tom DeLonge blink-182 rock
31:36 star
31:37 frankly I'd never heard of buddy 182 31:40 what my son told me oh yeah we know
31:43 about blink 182 but anyway in addition
31:47 to being the rock star that he is he's
31:50 also director and producer puts out
31:52 books of music and film and so on and
31:55 he's had a lifelong interest in the UFO
31:57 area and so he started talking with
32:01 various people and he was kind of the I
32:06 guess you say the action-oriented person
32:10 who said why don't we set up something
32:11 why don't we make this more available to
32:13 the public and he got to a number of us
32:15 and so we all began to band together lou
32:19 Elizondo who was in fact that department
32:23 of defense's the Pentagon's eighth tip
32:25 program director resigned from the
32:28 Pentagon and joined us Chris Mellon
32:33 20-year career deputy assistant
32:35 secretary of defense for intelligence
32:37 minority staff director of the Senate
32:39 committee intelligence he joined us we
32:44 got Jim simav an 25 year career
32:47 and CIA director of operation he was the
32:50 real James Bond kind of guy Steve
32:56 justice just retired as program director
32:59 for the billion-dollar programs at
33:01 Lockheed Martin skunk works he joins us
33:06 and then I agreed to be on the board so
33:10 I joined them in addition to my science
33:13 and engineering background I've had a
33:15 lot of activity and in classified areas
33:18 so it was a natural fit for me
33:21 interacting with all these people we
33:26 also put together a policy and
33:28 scientific advisory panel of the best
33:30 people we could find Chris Mellon agreed
33:33 to be the chair dr. Cohn Kelleher he was
33:38 actually the deputy administrator at
33:40 Bigler aerospace to run the a tip
33:43 program out of the pentagon dr. Gary
33:48 Nolan top genese genetics professor at
33:53 Stanford University dr. Cohn 30-year
33:58 career with CIA counter biological
34:00 weapons program dr. Rapp professor
34:04 military and emergency medicine
34:05 uniformed services University dr. Gilpin
34:09 consultant and academic biomedical
34:11 research and research law so we put
34:13 together a team as panelists to keep us
34:16 on the straight and narrow of really top
34:19 people who have wonderful backgrounds
34:22 and really want to see scientific work
34:27 be done in this area so the goals for
34:31 the to the stars Academy are promote the
34:33 concept at such forefront topics as UFO
34:36 SETI consciousness studies even
34:39 telepathy and psychokinesis should not
34:42 be considered taboo for serious
34:43 scientific consideration so I mean it's
34:46 a perfect match to the SSE because
34:48 that's our goal in the SSE as well and
34:52 of course Big Ideas that generate
34:55 funding to underwrite significant
34:56 research in these areas
34:58 develop user friendly databases so
35:00 information that is generated can be
35:03 accessed by anyone provide positive
35:07 support for collaborative government
35:10 aerospace industry and academic efforts
35:13 to accomplish all of the above so we
35:18 want to act as the glue in the public
35:21 sector and create entertainment
35:23 properties books and documentaries and
35:25 so on so that whatever is learned and
35:27 can be generated that can be delivered
35:31 out to the public if the structure of
35:36 the organization's has a science
35:38 structure aerospace structure and an
35:44 entertainment division what are the
35:50 activities of this organization to date
35:54 actually we were responsible for
35:56 legitimizing the topic in the mainstream
35:58 press that story that came out in the
36:02 New York Times and so on which then got
36:05 picked up by Washington Post CNN Fox
36:07 News was based on agreed upon interviews
36:11 with those of us that I've just gone
36:14 through a list of and given the quality
36:19 the source is coming out from the
36:21 shadows for example X Senate Majority
36:24 Leader Harry Reid top f-18 pilots a
36:28 significant department defense and
36:31 intelligence committee officials the bar
36:33 has been raised on legitimization of
36:34 this topic in the public arena we think
36:38 that's an accomplished goal to date and
36:42 via the community of interest postings
36:45 on the website we now have three high
36:49 quality of f-18 videotapes of
36:51 unidentified aerial phenomena encounters
36:53 they've been previously languishing in
36:56 the Pentagon servers nobody doing that
36:58 much with them these are still being
37:02 generated one of the tapes is from 2016 37:05 off the east coast of the United States
37:07 I mean there are a lot more tapes
37:11 hopefully we'll get a lot more of them
37:13 posted we only we don't just produce
37:19 positive results of what people would
37:21 think would be supportive results one of
37:24 our scientists science advisors as Gary
37:29 Nolan from from Stanford University
37:33 whose agenda genex expert and there had
37:37 been claims that some small humanoid
37:41 skeleton found in Chile so-called
37:44 Atacama humanoid you know might be et
37:50 Cie why somebody might might think that
37:53 if you see the structure but anyway
37:56 Nolan and people from other universities
37:58 put together a complete genetics thing
38:00 and did the entire genome and found that
38:04 in fact no unfortunately this is not
38:07 evidence of UT it's deformed human and
38:11 so that's up on the website if you wanna
38:13 read the paper it was published in one
38:16 of the top genetics journals very well
38:18 peer-reviewed and meetings are being set
38:24 up with people from other countries
38:25 because other countries who also have
38:28 materials don't necessarily want to give
38:31 them to the US government because they
38:32 disappear in a black hole and they never
38:34 learn anything but given our commitment
38:37 as a public benefit corporation that
38:40 that's not going to happen with us
38:41 they're now talking to us and we're
38:44 collaborating on obtaining materials
38:46 from foreign countries and of course
38:54 we're negotiating with media outlets to
38:56 get all this out in the public in the
38:59 form of documentaries or TV shows or
39:01 whatever so basically that's the back
39:04 story and a foreword story and I'm glad
39:08 to answer any questions I'll answer any
39:11 that I can thank you
39:24 thank or terrific presentation so your
39:28 good friend John Alexander published a
39:30 book I won't have a chance to ask him
39:32 this to define the research who was
39:40 holding the files it was somebody else
39:55 doing it and if if materials are being
40:00 held in special access programs casual
40:05 conversation even with high-level people
40:07 and who know your interest and they're
40:10 interested too won't necessarily reveal
40:12 the facts
40:50 [Music]
40:52 our character tell us they're not
41:00 different from this and some of them are
41:02 classified because of where they were
41:03 taken but as far as the content of what
41:08 we're interested in from a technical
41:10 standpoint they're they're not that
41:11 different and provided you strike out
41:16 the same location and so on then there's
41:20 a chance of getting them Declassified
41:22 and well you have to pick and choose
41:49 among the data I'm familiar with the
41:51 citizens hearing and so on and certainly
41:54 the depositions by the individuals who
42:00 were in the launch towers for missiles
42:04 that Bob Salas for example that's all
42:08 really good data and so and the FAA
42:11 Administrator came forward all good
42:18 thanks very much I want to bring him
42:22 something up in regards to the nature of
42:25 the release and I guess with the figure
42:28 was 22 million as well as a program that
42:31 was stated to be closed I guess I guess
42:35 maybe a week but I think it's basically
42:38 common knowledge among psycho
42:40 researchers that spending in actuality
42:43 isn't so some people in the research
42:50 community you know raise the question of
42:53 you know is this a wooden duck on the
42:55 pond to stay to figures so that was 22 42:58 million in that state with the program
43:01 no longer exists
43:03 I was something that you might make some
43:04 comments that's a fair concern this 22 43:15 million dollar program was one
43:17 particular program that doesn't say
43:21 there weren't other programs with other
43:22 funding levels and so it isn't like
43:27 suddenly there was this one program it
43:29 didn't last long didn't have that much
43:31 money and it shut down I mean interest
43:34 is continuing negotiations are
43:36 continuing other programs are being
43:39 looked at so a lot is going on I and my
43:44 colleagues spend a lot of time in
43:45 Washington talking to committees that
43:49 are looking at this from many different
43:51 angles so the general view that oh well
43:55 there's just one program came forward
43:57 didn't provide much of value and then it
44:00 got canceled that's not really the case
44:03 and also those figures are associated
44:06 with the figures that went out to
44:07 contractors but that doesn't mean that
44:09 people within the system aren't still
44:12 working on it
44:15 all of us maverick and mentors working
44:21 in our garages and mentoring and
44:23 engineering devices is there going to be
44:25 a clearinghouse for people to treat
44:28 discoveries like just the thing about
44:30 the frequency shift oh we love looking
44:33 for line shifts and lasers you see for
44:36 you generally my girl
44:38 Effects of just something like that is
44:41 incredibly valuable but things like that
44:45 we have a maverick inventor program at
44:47 earth tech international organization
44:50 and also the to the Stars Academy is
44:53 putting together a research organization
44:55 so if you're doing symmetric engineering
44:58 in your lab and you've got some lasers
44:59 shifting in frequency
45:01 bring them all well look at them okay
45:06 thank you
45:13 you 

==========pOxcUKzrY_U==========

00:00 this is an honor for me I just told how
00:03 that when mine reach came out he
00:05 seriously screwed up my life I read this
00:09 I said Oh give me a break
00:10 and so I set up a beautiful double-blind
00:13 study with a friend of mine cross
00:15 country didn't tell anybody about it and
00:17 damn it's his fault this certificate
00:25 says Tim Dinsdale Memorial Award
00:28 recognizing significant contributions to
00:30 the expansion of human understanding
00:32 through the study of unexplained
00:34 phenomena and more specifically to how
00:37 put off it says Harold for the
00:40 application of sound scientific
00:42 principles and methodologies to the
00:44 study of remote perception quantum zero
00:46 point fluctuations and unidentified
00:49 aerial objects and for realizing the
00:52 potential usefulness of these often
00:54 shunned phenomena in the real world to
00:58 hell
01:13 I'm very honored to receive this award
01:16 I've known many of the previous
01:18 recipients of the dennis dale award over
01:20 the years and they were all really truly
01:23 excellent researchers pushing the
01:27 boundaries into the frontier areas of
01:29 science so to join their ranks i
01:31 consider really quite a privilege the
01:35 three areas that he named and giving me
01:37 the award quantum vacuum fluctuations i
01:40 actually i still published in that area
01:43 in physics journals
01:44 the second area remote viewing in fact
01:48 it's very serendipitous that i should
01:51 receive this award for this particular
01:53 meeting since we have this co-sponsored
01:55 event with society for scientific
01:58 scientific exploration on one hand and
02:01 irva international reviewers association
02:04 on the other i was a founding member of
02:07 a bus
02:07 i'm really excited to see how people
02:10 have picked up the ball and run with it
02:12 in that area the third area unidentified
02:16 aerial phenomena i have not published
02:19 anything in why because the program i
02:23 was involved in in the pentagon and in
02:26 the intelligence community has been
02:28 top-secret behind the scenes and only
02:32 recently has there been release of
02:36 information about the program and so
02:39 this is the first chance that i've had a
02:41 chance to actually appear before the
02:44 public and speak about details of the
02:47 program and not go to jail so i'm gonna
02:50 go along at a rapid clip i've got a lot
02:52 of information here so here we go the
02:58 SSE is no stranger to the subject of
03:00 UFOs
03:02 unidentified aerial phenomena just a new
03:04 acronym for ufos back a couple of
03:08 decades ago peter Sturrock one of our
03:10 founding members of sse arranged with
03:15 [Music]
03:17 Rockefeller to hold a week-long workshop
03:23 at the Rockefeller residence we brought
03:28 in the best of the UFO researchers and
03:31 then a panel of independent experts and
03:34 had a week-long discussion of physical
03:38 evidence related to UFO objects of which
03:41 there there's a significant amount of
03:43 data and Laurance Rockefeller has hosted
03:47 the whole thing it was a wonderful
03:48 meeting eventually after publishing in
03:53 the SSE journal Peter Sturrock put
03:57 together a book the UFO enigma and it is
04:00 still one of the best books you can find
04:02 out there to take a look at what are the
04:05 physical aspects of UFOs that
04:09 researchers have uncovered however of
04:14 course the government also is no
04:15 stranger to the UFO phenomena anyone who
04:19 follows the field would be familiar with
04:21 project sine grudge and Blue Book but in
04:24 1969 the Condon committee shut it all
04:28 down and said really we don't need to be
04:31 involved in this area anymore we're not
04:34 learning anything we're not getting
04:35 anywhere it's not clear that this is a
04:38 significant area and so for the average
04:41 person on the street that's when it all
04:44 kind of ended at least serious
04:46 government interest in fact that's not
04:48 true
04:50 the very memo that shut down blue book
04:54 written by general bolander had as part
04:58 of its language reports of UFOs which
05:01 could affect national security would
05:03 continue to be handled through the
05:05 standard Air Force procedures designed
05:07 for this purpose nonetheless as far as
05:11 the public was concerned that was it
05:13 I mean the Air Force Public Affairs
05:16 Office put out circulars all the time in
05:20 response to questions saying no while we
05:22 gave this up in 1969 what in fact did
05:27 occur was that there were programs going
05:29 on behind the scenes
05:30 anyway as required by the Belinda
05:33 mineral now most people didn't know
05:35 about these programs they weren't
05:37 advertised they weren't responded to fo
05:40 a requests usually went dry but that all
05:44 changed last December when the New York
05:48 Times published a front-page story on
05:51 how there was this program investigating
05:56 this area advanced aerospace threat
05:59 identification program it was deeply
06:02 buried but New York Times had good
06:05 sources and they came up with
06:07 information about the program and so
06:09 there's been a lot of publicity about it
06:12 since the New York Times broke the story
06:16 Washington Post CNN Fox News it's been
06:19 picked up all over the place and one of
06:24 the reasons why it's attracted attention
06:25 at this point are the quality of the
06:28 sources going public X Senate Majority
06:32 Leader Harry Reid is the one who
06:34 initiated the program top rate at f-18 06:38 pilots who encountered advanced
06:39 aerospace vehicles at close range
06:41 were permitted to come forward and tell
06:44 their stories which up till now they
06:47 hadn't because they didn't want to lose
06:48 their flight status by reporting what
06:51 they had found at least publicly a
06:54 number of significant Department of
06:56 Defense and intelligence community
06:57 officials have come forward to talk
07:00 about the reality of this phenomenon and
07:03 the fact that there were programs going
07:04 on the program was nicknamed advanced
07:09 aerospace threat identification program
07:12 a tip people who have trouble trying to
07:17 get documents out of the Pentagon by
07:19 saying they want all documents and a tip
07:21 and they have a hard time because that
07:23 wasn't actually the name of the program
07:24 that top name there is the actual name
07:27 of the program but a tip was with the
07:29 nicknames and it went by
07:32 it began in June of 2007 defense
07:38 intelligence agency was concerned about
07:40 the fact that obvious observation had
07:43 shown
07:43 Advanced aerospace vehicles crafts of
07:46 drones of unknown origin we're flying
07:49 all over the United States over waters
07:52 in fact globally is a case and so a
07:57 congressional budget was approved to
07:58 address the issue behind the scenes
08:01 senator Majority Senate Majority Leader
08:04 Harry Reid from Nevada was the one who
08:06 was the initiator of the program joined
08:10 by Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens
08:13 these are the people who generally
08:15 approved programs that were in the black
08:18 under high security behind the scenes
08:21 and so they set up this program Senator
08:28 Reid has not walked this back since all
08:30 the news came out he's been very
08:32 forthright and given a number of
08:33 interviews this particular statement
08:35 sort of captures it all we don't know
08:38 the answers but we have plenty of
08:40 evidence to support the questions this
08:43 is about science and national security
08:45 if America doesn't take a lead answering
08:47 these questions others will well there's
08:52 a two-fold nature of the threat first of
08:55 all you've got these advanced aerospace
08:57 vehicles flying around that we don't
08:59 know where they come from
09:00 who's driving them what the intent is
09:05 possibly offworld even but the future
09:09 threat was actually as far as a
09:11 department fence went and the
09:13 intelligence community one of the
09:15 greater concerns what happens in
09:18 potential adversaries achieve
09:22 significant breakthroughs by getting
09:23 hold of advanced technology either based
09:28 on their study of the phenomena or from
09:31 sensor data or crash retrieve materials
09:33 then that could provide a problem for
09:35 the United States and the sense of
09:38 threat and there's reason to be
09:42 concerned about that this is a document
09:44 in the program we dug up out of the
09:46 Soviet Union it's a very thick document
09:48 it shows that the Soviet Union had a
09:51 massive program also trying to get to
09:54 the root of all of this
09:56 and in this document a number of
09:58 research institutes and military
09:59 institutes are listed and of course they
10:03 had the same concerns we did is there
10:05 threat from the phenomena or might the
10:09 Americans make headway before us and
10:12 that be a threat just to give you an
10:17 idea of what's being observed which many
10:20 a people seen because it's been in the
10:22 news a lot lately back in November of
10:25 2004 a Nimitz carrier group was out on
10:30 patrol off of San Diego and in several
10:34 occasions an advanced aerospace vehicle
10:37 would descend rapidly from 60,000 feet
10:40 to 50 feet in seconds and then hover and
10:44 then take off like a boy when it first
10:51 happened and happened over a number of
10:53 weeks actually two f-18 I'll talk about
10:56 two f-18 pilots were vectored unto the
11:00 site where this they were being observed
11:03 by the radars to investigate and what
11:08 they saw was what they call the tic-tac
11:10 craft solid white smooth no edges about
11:17 forty six feet in length uniformly
11:21 colored known as cells pylons and wings
11:25 the f-18s could not obtain lock with
11:28 their radars because they were stealthy
11:31 but forward-looking infrared radar could
11:35 pick them up to some degree based on
11:38 their heat signatures and the advanced
11:42 service phase vehicle appeared to
11:43 demonstrate advanced acceleration
11:45 aerodynamic and propulsion capability
11:47 beyond anything that that we knew
11:50 existed on the planet I'm going to play
11:54 Fleur video that many of you may have
11:57 seen
12:03 got sound with the video do you have
12:10 [Music]
12:30 that's not us though is it for something
12:36 it's rotated gonna play one more time
12:54 there's a hole clean up what the man
12:57 said but all going against the window
13:03 into high school playing oh oh
13:25 you might ask yourself well like what
13:27 can you prove from from a videotape I
13:29 mean you can see videotapes all over the
13:31 internet and so on but this was data
13:33 fusion their gun camera tapes they're
13:36 these videotapes from the pilots voice
13:38 recordings data link recordings from
13:41 ages and many other military platforms
13:44 expert witnesses so in fact the data
13:48 density and this is what's changed the
13:51 field a lot our detection capability has
13:54 gotten so advanced that we're losing our
13:57 inability to see exactly what's going on
14:02 the FLIR displays were recorded their
14:06 detailed debriefs of the pilots in that
14:09 original New York Times article you can
14:10 see a page long debrief of de flavor
14:14 oops
14:17 key assessments the advanced aerospace
14:21 vehicle the vehicle has no known air
14:24 vehicle in the inventory of the US or
14:26 foreign nation as far as we can tell
14:29 low observable characteristics are
14:31 stealthy the exhibit advanced
14:35 aerodynamic performance that we can't
14:38 imagine how they do it
14:39 and recognize that these are infrared
14:41 tapes from the pilots so if there was
14:44 some kind of hot propulsion gases coming
14:46 out the back you would have seen it yeah
14:52 the advanced capability to remain
14:54 stationary and then take off like a shot
14:56 Dave favore says was like somebody
14:59 suddenly shot a bullet so how do we
15:05 respond to this the Defense Intelligence
15:06 Agency put out a broad area announcement
15:08 in fact it was unclassified they wanted
15:11 to evaluate twelve potential threat
15:13 areas with regard to these advanced
15:15 aerospace vehicles there's a list of
15:17 them exactly what you would think you'd
15:20 want to know
15:21 live propulsion signature reduction in
15:24 human effects and so on
15:28 you know it turned out that anyone any
15:31 Aerospace Corporation could could apply
15:33 could send in a proposal DIA chose Big O
15:36 of aerospace as a contractor to address
15:38 the threat now there's been buzz on the
15:41 internet about okay well Senator Reid
15:43 came from Nevada and Bigelow Aerospace
15:45 is in Nevada so wasn't is just some
15:48 sweetheart deal in fact that's not the
15:50 case it was a broad area announcement
15:53 anybody could go for it
15:54 Bigelow was actually a good choice he'd
15:57 spent a lot of his own money because
15:58 he's interested in this area up to this
16:00 point investigating the the phenomena
16:03 and he had the best proposal and so he
16:08 was tasked and so he set up a special
16:10 organization called Bigelow Aerospace
16:11 advanced Space Studies so we we call it
16:14 bass to do all the things you'd expect
16:17 the program like this to do well bass
16:21 connected contacted me at Arctic
16:24 international to collaborate as a
16:26 subcontractor and I agreed to do that
16:31 okay what did I address as a
16:33 subcontractor well one of the critical
16:35 issues is that there's so much
16:37 high-level security and
16:39 compartmentalization in this subject
16:40 area and there's a lot of it is
16:43 difficult for contractors to obtain
16:46 expert opinions on advanced technologies
16:49 because they would expose why they were
16:52 interested so I acted as a surrogate I
16:56 was contracted to Commission mostly
17:00 unclassified white papers from experts
17:02 around the globe where their particular
17:05 aerospace related subject areas would be
17:07 in 2050 as like a general survey of
17:10 aerospace futures I decide this would be
17:13 the best way to get the best knowledge
17:15 we had across many technologies without
17:18 actually exposing why we wanted to know
17:21 so I let out 38 contracts over a
17:25 two-year period I'll show you what the
17:29 studies were on you can read them
17:32 they're positron and aerospace
17:35 propulsion IEC fusion as a compact
17:38 energy source work drive
17:40 work energy extra dimensions metallic
17:43 glasses for aerospace use really
17:45 cutting-edge kinds of things here's some
17:49 more of the papers that I commissioned
17:51 negative mass propulsion antigravity for
17:54 aerospace applications and so on
17:59 programmable matter invisibility cloak
18:03 II these are just the kind of things
18:06 that we needed to have maximum technical
18:09 input from the best people around the
18:11 globe that's what we did that's what I
18:13 did
18:14 now we could--we we told these people
18:16 they could publish their reports and
18:19 physics journals and engineering
18:21 journals but of course the contractor
18:23 didn't want to wait for that so the
18:25 Defense Intelligence Agency bundled up
18:27 these 38 papers and put them out as
18:30 Defense Intelligence reference documents
18:32 posted on a jwilks
18:35 server that anyone in the government or
18:39 contractors could get access to by and
18:42 large they have not been released and to
18:45 the public yet a couple of leaked at so
18:50 let me give you an example of well how
18:53 does this stuff help people who are
18:55 chasing these really difficult problems
18:58 I'm choosing one here many materials for
19:01 aerospace use I'd love to talk about
19:03 really fancy materials but they're
19:07 classified however there's a lot of
19:10 materials that have been picked up or
19:13 provided even in the public domain I'm
19:16 gonna give an example because it shows
19:18 exactly what this structure is for how
19:20 to deal with this this is an open source
19:23 sample it was sent anonymously to
19:28 talk-show host art Bell the fellow
19:31 claimed to be in the military he said
19:34 that this sample was picked up in a
19:36 crash retrieval and so he sent it by
19:38 email so what does that mean
19:40 chain-of-custody non-existent provenance
19:44 questionable could be a hoax it could be
19:49 some slag off of some foundry floor or
19:51 whatever however
19:54 it was an unusual sample so we decided
19:57 to take a look at it it was a
20:01 multi-layered bismuth and magnesium
20:04 sample bismuth layers less than a human
20:07 hair
20:07 magnesium samples about ten times the
20:10 size of a human hair supposedly picked
20:13 up in the crash retrieval of an advanced
20:16 aerospace vehicle looks like it's been
20:20 in a crash the white lines are the
20:23 bismuth the darker areas are the
20:26 magnesium separations so the question
20:31 was what about this material so
20:33 naturally we looked in all of the
20:35 National Labs we talked to metallurgist
20:38 we combed the entire structure of
20:41 published papers no where could we find
20:44 any evidence that anybody ever made one
20:46 of these secondly some attempts were
20:50 made to try to reproduce this material
20:53 but they couldn't get the bismuth and
20:55 magnesium layers to bond thirdly when we
20:59 talked to people who in the materials
21:02 field who should know they said we don't
21:04 know why anybody would want to make
21:06 anything like this it's not obvious that
21:08 it has any function well years later
21:15 decades later actually finally our own
21:18 science moves along we move into an area
21:21 called metamaterials and it turns out
21:24 that exactly this combination of
21:26 materials at exactly those dimensions
21:30 turn out to be an excellent microscopic
21:34 waveguide for very high frequency
21:37 electromagnetic radiation terahertz
21:38 frequencies so the wavelength is 60 21:47 microns which is pretty small size but
21:50 it turns out that because of the
21:52 metamaterial aspect of this
21:55 material those bismuth layers that act
21:59 as waveguides can be one twentieth the
22:02 size of the wavelength and usually when
22:04 you make a waveguide it's got to be
22:06 about the size of the wavelength so in
22:08 fact this turned out to be a material
22:11 that would propagate sub-wavelength
22:12 we've got effects why somebody wants to
22:16 do that we don't know the answer to that
22:18 but anyway it was amazing that we've
22:20 gone through this and this is the kind
22:22 of structure we go through a lot you get
22:25 a material sample than usual
22:26 characteristics to be evaluated the
22:29 method of manufacture difficult to
22:31 assess or reproduce the purpose of the
22:34 function is not readily apparent as with
22:38 our sample here and then as our own
22:40 technical knowledge moves forward we
22:43 finally see a possible purpose of
22:46 function comes to light that sequence is
22:49 repeated over and over in this
22:51 particular area I'll pick a second one
22:55 here for the engineers of physicists in
22:59 the crowd probably be more interesting
23:01 spacetime metric engineering this
23:03 happened to be the paper that I myself
23:05 provided one of the questions is can the
23:10 reported anomalous observables of these
23:13 advanced aerospace vehicles be accounted
23:15 for in the basis of known physics I mean
23:18 you hear people describing craft taking
23:21 right angle turns at high speeds and
23:24 other things with the hovering and rapid
23:29 acceleration and so on as if the craft
23:32 didn't have any inertial mass well it
23:35 turns out although general relativity
23:38 Einstein's general relativity is usually
23:39 used in Astrophysical applications and
23:42 gravity studies and so on you can look
23:45 at it from an engineering standpoint so
23:47 if you take an engineering approach to
23:49 general relativity what I just showed
23:52 can be can be understood if you could
23:56 change the space-time metric the way
23:57 general relativity I'm talking about
23:59 text book not some fanciful physics you
24:02 could even get faster than light travel
24:04 Alcubierre warp drive warp drive
24:07 as in Star Trek again you might think
24:10 that's a fanciful kind of thing but that
24:12 paper was published in one of the top
24:14 general relativity journals classical
24:16 corner gravity the warp drive hyper fast
24:19 travel within general relativity so if
24:23 you engineer space-time metric you can
24:26 begin to line up observables with
24:29 physics that we know and love even if we
24:31 can't reproduce it what about the
24:35 velocity of light constraint people are
24:37 always saying that you know how could
24:40 you have a wormhole you let you go from
24:41 one side of the university of the other
24:43 aren't you beating the speed of light
24:45 well what does the physicist and
24:47 engineer mean by the speed of light he
24:49 means this little equation here with
24:54 speed of light it's given by 1 over the
24:57 square root of the permittivity times
24:58 the permeability of the vacuum so the
25:01 point is if you re-engineer those vacuum
25:04 parameters then you can make the
25:06 effective speed of light higher in the
25:08 engineered region and so those are the
25:11 solution and general relativity that are
25:13 called wormholes and again it's not
25:15 science fiction this is just right off
25:17 the shelf standard textbook general
25:22 relativity applications so what that
25:25 means is the reduced in time
25:27 interstellar travel it's not as skeptics
25:30 would say you can't get from there to
25:31 here advanced CT civilizations now
25:35 ourselves in the future and not
25:37 fundamentally constrained by physical
25:39 principles the exotic physics for such
25:42 can be addressed in engineering terms
25:44 sort of metric engineering as it were
25:47 does this have any help again by the way
25:50 this paper also was published as one of
25:53 the Defense Intelligence reference
25:55 documents and since we are permitted to
25:59 publish in the open literature I
26:02 published that paper in a British
26:06 interplanetary science journal
26:08 so if you're interested in looking at
26:10 the details you can get learn as much as
26:12 you want to know about metric
26:14 engineering and that helped us
26:21 understand some of the aspects I mean
26:23 you may have heard the phrase dense
26:25 stars you get redshift well it turns out
26:28 in this engineer technology you get
26:30 so-called blue shift that is frequencies
26:33 are up shifted to higher frequencies so
26:37 for example in this room so for example
26:41 in this room most of the radiation
26:43 coming off our bodies off the walls and
26:51 what we see things in the visible range
26:54 but what happens if you get into a
26:57 volume of space where the vacuum has
26:59 been engineered and the way I've been
27:01 discussing it turns out to get a blue
27:03 shift so in fact the infrared you don't
27:07 ordinarily see can get blue shifted up
27:09 into the visible so it's not surprising
27:11 that all these craft should be so
27:13 luminous now the downside from all of
27:16 this is the fact that visible light
27:18 which doesn't have any particularly
27:21 harmful effects gets blue shifted up
27:24 into the ultraviolet so we get too close
27:29 to Atlantic craft you might get a
27:31 sunburn or off into the soft x-ray
27:35 region so the chance of radiation
27:37 poisoning so if you run across one of
27:41 these sitting on the ground I would
27:42 recommend you don't and it's powered up
27:44 I'd recommend you don't rush up and well
27:48 that helped us to understand we as part
27:51 of this program we looked at some cases
27:53 that are really good from Brazil 77 78 27:58 it was like Close Encounters of the
28:00 Third Kind thousand pages of documents
28:04 all done by the Brazilian Air Force
28:05 investigative team 500 photographs 15 28:09 hours of motion film a lot of medical
28:11 injuries I know you probably can't read
28:16 that from here but it's just a list of
28:18 the different kinds of medical injuries
28:19 that
28:20 when people encounter these craft at
28:24 close range and it has some overlap with
28:27 cases that we've investigated during the
28:30 program of injuries occurring well
28:35 despite the progress in the ATF program
28:37 let's face it topic is inherently
28:39 anomalous right therefore despite the
28:46 reality of the observations and all the
28:49 people that we interact with in the
28:50 intelligence community and the Pentagon
28:53 agree the data is there it's it's real
28:56 nonetheless the topic doesn't fit
28:58 smoothly into known profiles of
29:01 government programs for sure and by
29:04 virtual natural security implications
29:06 it's high compartmentalization of topic
29:09 therefore a slow pace of cumulative
29:12 progress and integration we call them
29:14 stovepipes you have a lot of people with
29:16 lots of detailed information about some
29:19 particular aspect but they don't talk to
29:21 each other even it's sitting at the next
29:24 desk and let's face it advocacy of the
29:29 issue in government circles is not
29:31 viewed as a career enhancing in part
29:36 because despite the weirdness of the
29:39 subject if you don't make a lot of
29:42 progress you know it doesn't look good
29:44 on your resume that you're moving up the
29:46 line so because of that there's a
29:51 forward story many of us involved in the
29:55 program decided that there should be an
29:57 outreach program in the public sector so
30:01 this is the forward story the goal was
30:04 established a broad base high quality
30:06 scientific community of interest in the
30:09 public sector concerning these
30:11 unidentified aerial phenomena and other
30:14 related leading-edge topics and so we
30:19 got together and formed a company called
30:21 to the stars Academy of Arts and Science
30:25 it was co-founded by entrepreneur Tom
30:28 DeLonge I'll talk about him in a minute
30:31 senior intelligence officers from
30:33 Department defense and CIA and
30:35 distinguished research scientists we all
30:38 banded together to form this Academy it
30:43 was set up as a public benefit
30:45 corporation so the public can invest and
30:48 therefore it's owned by the public so
30:52 this is something new
30:53 whatever comes out of any of the
30:55 research or any of the release of
30:57 information is actually going to be
30:59 owned by the public it's not going to
31:00 disappear into a black hole
31:03 very transparent structure if you go to
31:05 the website you can see everything from
31:08 the financial structure to the
31:11 activities and we do have a web-based
31:14 community of interest where things get
31:16 posted for example those this f-18 flare
31:22 tape I show we now have three of them up
31:24 there probably more to come all right
31:30 well who was the principles of this
31:31 organization Tom DeLonge blink-182 rock
31:36 star
31:37 frankly I'd never heard of buddy 182 31:40 what my son told me oh yeah we know
31:43 about blink 182 but anyway in addition
31:47 to being the rock star that he is he's
31:50 also director and producer puts out
31:52 books of music and film and so on and
31:55 he's had a lifelong interest in the UFO
31:57 area and so he started talking with
32:01 various people and he was kind of the I
32:06 guess you say the action-oriented person
32:10 who said why don't we set up something
32:11 why don't we make this more available to
32:13 the public and he got to a number of us
32:15 and so we all began to band together lou
32:19 Elizondo who was in fact that department
32:23 of defense's the Pentagon's eighth tip
32:25 program director resigned from the
32:28 Pentagon and joined us Chris Mellon
32:33 20-year career deputy assistant
32:35 secretary of defense for intelligence
32:37 minority staff director of the Senate
32:39 committee intelligence he joined us we
32:44 got Jim simav an 25 year career
32:47 and CIA director of operation he was the
32:50 real James Bond kind of guy Steve
32:56 justice just retired as program director
32:59 for the billion-dollar programs at
33:01 Lockheed Martin skunk works he joins us
33:06 and then I agreed to be on the board so
33:10 I joined them in addition to my science
33:13 and engineering background I've had a
33:15 lot of activity and in classified areas
33:18 so it was a natural fit for me
33:21 interacting with all these people we
33:26 also put together a policy and
33:28 scientific advisory panel of the best
33:30 people we could find Chris Mellon agreed
33:33 to be the chair dr. Cohn Kelleher he was
33:38 actually the deputy administrator at
33:40 Bigler aerospace to run the a tip
33:43 program out of the pentagon dr. Gary
33:48 Nolan top genese genetics professor at
33:53 Stanford University dr. Cohn 30-year
33:58 career with CIA counter biological
34:00 weapons program dr. Rapp professor
34:04 military and emergency medicine
34:05 uniformed services University dr. Gilpin
34:09 consultant and academic biomedical
34:11 research and research law so we put
34:13 together a team as panelists to keep us
34:16 on the straight and narrow of really top
34:19 people who have wonderful backgrounds
34:22 and really want to see scientific work
34:27 be done in this area so the goals for
34:31 the to the stars Academy are promote the
34:33 concept at such forefront topics as UFO
34:36 SETI consciousness studies even
34:39 telepathy and psychokinesis should not
34:42 be considered taboo for serious
34:43 scientific consideration so I mean it's
34:46 a perfect match to the SSE because
34:48 that's our goal in the SSE as well and
34:52 of course Big Ideas that generate
34:55 funding to underwrite significant
34:56 research in these areas
34:58 develop user friendly databases so
35:00 information that is generated can be
35:03 accessed by anyone provide positive
35:07 support for collaborative government
35:10 aerospace industry and academic efforts
35:13 to accomplish all of the above so we
35:18 want to act as the glue in the public
35:21 sector and create entertainment
35:23 properties books and documentaries and
35:25 so on so that whatever is learned and
35:27 can be generated that can be delivered
35:31 out to the public if the structure of
35:36 the organization's has a science
35:38 structure aerospace structure and an
35:44 entertainment division what are the
35:50 activities of this organization to date
35:54 actually we were responsible for
35:56 legitimizing the topic in the mainstream
35:58 press that story that came out in the
36:02 New York Times and so on which then got
36:05 picked up by Washington Post CNN Fox
36:07 News was based on agreed upon interviews
36:11 with those of us that I've just gone
36:14 through a list of and given the quality
36:19 the source is coming out from the
36:21 shadows for example X Senate Majority
36:24 Leader Harry Reid top f-18 pilots a
36:28 significant department defense and
36:31 intelligence committee officials the bar
36:33 has been raised on legitimization of
36:34 this topic in the public arena we think
36:38 that's an accomplished goal to date and
36:42 via the community of interest postings
36:45 on the website we now have three high
36:49 quality of f-18 videotapes of
36:51 unidentified aerial phenomena encounters
36:53 they've been previously languishing in
36:56 the Pentagon servers nobody doing that
36:58 much with them these are still being
37:02 generated one of the tapes is from 2016 37:05 off the east coast of the United States
37:07 I mean there are a lot more tapes
37:11 hopefully we'll get a lot more of them
37:13 posted we only we don't just produce
37:19 positive results of what people would
37:21 think would be supportive results one of
37:24 our scientists science advisors as Gary
37:29 Nolan from from Stanford University
37:33 whose agenda genex expert and there had
37:37 been claims that some small humanoid
37:41 skeleton found in Chile so-called
37:44 Atacama humanoid you know might be et
37:50 Cie why somebody might might think that
37:53 if you see the structure but anyway
37:56 Nolan and people from other universities
37:58 put together a complete genetics thing
38:00 and did the entire genome and found that
38:04 in fact no unfortunately this is not
38:07 evidence of UT it's deformed human and
38:11 so that's up on the website if you wanna
38:13 read the paper it was published in one
38:16 of the top genetics journals very well
38:18 peer-reviewed and meetings are being set
38:24 up with people from other countries
38:25 because other countries who also have
38:28 materials don't necessarily want to give
38:31 them to the US government because they
38:32 disappear in a black hole and they never
38:34 learn anything but given our commitment
38:37 as a public benefit corporation that
38:40 that's not going to happen with us
38:41 they're now talking to us and we're
38:44 collaborating on obtaining materials
38:46 from foreign countries and of course
38:54 we're negotiating with media outlets to
38:56 get all this out in the public in the
38:59 form of documentaries or TV shows or
39:01 whatever so basically that's the back
39:04 story and a foreword story and I'm glad
39:08 to answer any questions I'll answer any
39:11 that I can thank you
39:24 thank or terrific presentation so your
39:28 good friend John Alexander published a
39:30 book I won't have a chance to ask him
39:32 this to define the research who was
39:40 holding the files it was somebody else
39:55 doing it and if if materials are being
40:00 held in special access programs casual
40:05 conversation even with high-level people
40:07 and who know your interest and they're
40:10 interested too won't necessarily reveal
40:12 the facts
40:50 [Music]
40:52 our character tell us they're not
41:00 different from this and some of them are
41:02 classified because of where they were
41:03 taken but as far as the content of what
41:08 we're interested in from a technical
41:10 standpoint they're they're not that
41:11 different and provided you strike out
41:16 the same location and so on then there's
41:20 a chance of getting them Declassified
41:22 and well you have to pick and choose
41:49 among the data I'm familiar with the
41:51 citizens hearing and so on and certainly
41:54 the depositions by the individuals who
42:00 were in the launch towers for missiles
42:04 that Bob Salas for example that's all
42:08 really good data and so and the FAA
42:11 Administrator came forward all good
42:18 thanks very much I want to bring him
42:22 something up in regards to the nature of
42:25 the release and I guess with the figure
42:28 was 22 million as well as a program that
42:31 was stated to be closed I guess I guess
42:35 maybe a week but I think it's basically
42:38 common knowledge among psycho
42:40 researchers that spending in actuality
42:43 isn't so some people in the research
42:50 community you know raise the question of
42:53 you know is this a wooden duck on the
42:55 pond to stay to figures so that was 22 42:58 million in that state with the program
43:01 no longer exists
43:03 I was something that you might make some
43:04 comments that's a fair concern this 22 43:15 million dollar program was one
43:17 particular program that doesn't say
43:21 there weren't other programs with other
43:22 funding levels and so it isn't like
43:27 suddenly there was this one program it
43:29 didn't last long didn't have that much
43:31 money and it shut down I mean interest
43:34 is continuing negotiations are
43:36 continuing other programs are being
43:39 looked at so a lot is going on I and my
43:44 colleagues spend a lot of time in
43:45 Washington talking to committees that
43:49 are looking at this from many different
43:51 angles so the general view that oh well
43:55 there's just one program came forward
43:57 didn't provide much of value and then it
44:00 got canceled that's not really the case
44:03 and also those figures are associated
44:06 with the figures that went out to
44:07 contractors but that doesn't mean that
44:09 people within the system aren't still
44:12 working on it
44:15 all of us maverick and mentors working
44:21 in our garages and mentoring and
44:23 engineering devices is there going to be
44:25 a clearinghouse for people to treat
44:28 discoveries like just the thing about
44:30 the frequency shift oh we love looking
44:33 for line shifts and lasers you see for
44:36 you generally my girl
44:38 Effects of just something like that is
44:41 incredibly valuable but things like that
44:45 we have a maverick inventor program at
44:47 earth tech international organization
44:50 and also the to the Stars Academy is
44:53 putting together a research organization
44:55 so if you're doing symmetric engineering
44:58 in your lab and you've got some lasers
44:59 shifting in frequency
45:01 bring them all well look at them okay
45:06 thank you
45:13 you 

==========WjhSt_XoPRk==========

00:04 talk about this 2009 unclassified letter
00:07 uh in which it you've got to read
00:09 between the lines a little bit but it is
00:11 pregnant with possibilities i mean the
00:13 implications of what what you see in
00:15 those is that this is real
00:18 that assessment runs very contrary to
00:20 the statements that the pentagon has
00:22 made pentagon spokespeople have since
00:25 you came forward
00:27 you know yeah yeah
00:29 i think there's a lot of pockets within
00:30 department of defense that may not
00:32 necessarily know exactly what
00:34 you know
00:35 another pocket is doing right the right
00:37 hand doesn't always know what the left
00:38 hand is doing they try
00:40 i don't think it's deliberate or on
00:41 purpose i don't think it's a
00:42 misinformation campaign
00:45 i think
00:46 [Music]
00:48 if there was a question as to what the
00:50 government knows or doesn't know you'd
00:52 probably have to bring that up to the
00:53 government to answer
00:56 i certainly don't want to
00:59 guess why the government
01:01 said what they did
01:02 um i can only
01:05 imagine for two reasons a national
01:06 security and if it's not national
01:08 security uh they just
01:10 didn't know yeah atip is uh the program
01:12 was killed right and it was killed
01:14 because it didn't find anything right
01:16 this this letter we're talking about
01:17 says they did find stuff well and i've
01:20 made that very clear before um without
01:23 necessarily referring to the to the memo
01:25 that atip did find a lot of stuff
01:28 this wasn't just a one-off looking at
01:30 the nimitz incident there were many many
01:31 incidents we looked at and we looked at
01:33 them on a continuing basis and we
01:35 thought we saw
01:36 some congruences throughout these
01:38 incidents time and time and time again
01:40 some repeated patterns of behavior and
01:42 as an intelligence officer when you see
01:44 those repeated patterns of behavior
01:46 that is key that something's going on
01:48 that there is something there of
01:49 predictability that you can use then
01:52 later on to figure out how these things
01:54 work and what these things really are
01:56 though the arguments that were made in
01:57 that letter are still valid today
01:59 absolutely in my opinion absolutely
02:01 they're more valid now than they ever
02:03 have been before
02:05 um
02:06 it feels like something's going on and i
02:08 i don't
02:09 it's there's some sensitivities involved
02:11 but i mean is that feeling correct
02:13 there's a well you'll have to excuse my
02:16 uh
02:17 my response on this but but george um
02:20 in the end i've always said it doesn't
02:21 matter what my feelings are right i may
02:23 feel something
02:25 but um i also may be wrong so um
02:29 i sense
02:30 that
02:31 the conversation is occurring now
02:37 among the american people and among some
02:39 of our senior levels of government
02:40 that has never happened before
02:42 and i'm very optimistic about that
02:45 how i feel about it is probably
02:47 irrelevant but i will tell you if you're
02:49 asking i feel good about it i feel that
02:51 finally people can have a rational
02:53 conversation
02:55 and and and people much smarter than me
02:57 can figure out what the healthy things
02:59 are well the reason you left is because
03:00 it wasn't getting the attention it
03:02 deserved and absolutely absolutely same
03:04 argument that this right i actually left
03:06 out of loyalty not disloyalty because i
03:09 love the department and the leadership
03:11 so much particularly
03:12 secretary mattis
03:14 that there was no other way for me to
03:16 communicate
03:17 that these things that we were seeing
03:20 and experiencing were real and that they
03:22 were being collected by
03:24 not just grandma in the backyard
03:26 shooting a camera and seeing some lights
03:27 back there this is by trained observers
03:30 flying multi-million dollar weapon
03:31 platform systems sometimes over u.s
03:33 cities that we we trust to fight and win
03:35 wars on our behalf and they're telling
03:37 you they're seeing something
03:38 they're seeing something that they they
03:40 don't know what it is and we have to pay
03:42 attention which is backed up by
03:43 electrical electro optical data which is
03:45 backed up by the radar data which is
03:46 backed up by you know
03:48 more and more and more layers at some
03:49 point you have to look and say you know
03:52 there's an old saying we have if you see
03:53 it once it's an anomaly if you see it
03:55 twice it could be a coincidence if you
03:57 see it three times
03:58 you're probably looking at a trend right
04:01 and so that's what we're seeing and when
04:03 you're building this mosaic you're
04:04 building this this
04:07 for lack of better terms this jigsaw
04:08 puzzle
04:10 you know people will say well
04:11 how do you even know where to begin well
04:14 you begin with the first piece right you
04:16 take a a a 1 000 piece jigsaw puzzle and
04:19 i'm not very smart so i'm not very good
04:21 at building anything so what i usually
04:22 do is take the four corners first and i
04:24 set those pieces aside because you can
04:26 tell what are the four corners then i
04:28 take all the pieces that have the
04:29 straight edge because i know they're
04:30 going to be the border and i set those
04:31 aside right so that's in another little
04:33 bin and then what i do is i take all the
04:35 pieces that are kind of the similar
04:36 colors and i'll take those and probably
04:38 figure they're probably part of the same
04:40 scene and i'll set those aside and
04:41 before long
04:42 my daughter and i went from having a
04:44 thousand piece jumbled mess so now we
04:47 have five or six bins that we can say
04:49 okay these are common pieces that are
04:51 going to help us now put together the
04:53 picture and so
04:56 very much i know it's a very poor
04:57 analogy but very much that that
05:00 same methodology we did that with an
05:01 a-tip we tried to find those
05:03 commonalities and bend those in what we
05:06 now know as a five observables of
05:07 combatives of five observables and that
05:09 has helped us really
05:12 focus in on
05:14 on collecting the data pieces that are
05:15 that are that
05:16 are very important or the pieces of data
05:18 that we don't have yet
05:20 can you describe
05:22 there is confusion about atip asap bass
05:25 different acronyms how that all
05:28 you describe your network of guys sure
05:30 and and how that interacted with the
05:32 others so uh george
05:34 i understand when we first came out i
05:36 was only
05:37 in charge of atip at the time so it
05:39 really wasn't up to me to have a a a big
05:42 lengthy discussion about ossat before
05:44 that advanced weapons uh special
05:47 application program
05:50 but
05:51 in the end um i i knew that information
05:53 would eventually come out enough people
05:55 are asking the right questions that it
05:57 would come out and and i want it it
05:59 needs to come out but it can't kill him
06:00 from me right because that really wasn't
06:02 that started before i came on board and
06:05 therefore my knowledge of it is is a bit
06:08 limited so in essence in 2007 06:11 the initial program was called a wsap
06:14 program
06:16 and it was that name for about nine
06:18 months
06:19 and that program was later refined it
06:22 was a
06:23 bit of a
06:24 shotgun approach to the to the phenomena
06:26 so included a lot of stuff in this
06:28 program uh on trying to figure out how
06:31 these things fly and where they coming
06:33 out of where they're going and things
06:35 like that
06:36 when i came into the program the name
06:39 had just been changed to aatip advanced
06:42 aerospace threat identification program
06:43 atip
06:45 not advanced aviation advanced aerospace
06:48 i know people keep saying it's advanced
06:50 aviation it's not and eventually that'll
06:52 come out too and people will realize
06:53 that was that's not the name it's
06:55 advanced aerospace
06:56 threat identification program and so
06:58 when i came in the name had atip had
07:00 already been been issued and that's what
07:02 it was being referred to as now whether
07:04 it was not a nickname or a formal name
07:06 it was a formal name for us it was
07:07 briefed as atip but if people want to
07:09 you know argue about semantics and they
07:11 want to say it was a nickname that's
07:12 fine but it wasn't really a nickname at
07:15 least not for me and the guys that and
07:16 the gals that were working with me
07:18 so um
07:19 it was a tip and that's how we briefed
07:21 it but anyways that focus was really on
07:23 the more of the nuts and bolts uh
07:25 looking at what it is and and how does
07:27 it work right and as i've said before
07:30 many times that was our focus and that
07:32 was atip's focus so we went from a broad
07:34 kind of spotlight approach to more of a
07:36 narrowly focused laser approach trying
07:38 to figure out pieces of this because it
07:40 was just too much too much of the
07:42 elephant to eat in one bite frankly in
07:44 my opinion anyways it could be wrong but
07:47 looking at now hindsight being 2020 the
07:49 awsap program
07:52 given the resources 22 million dollars
07:54 would never be enough to really
07:57 follow each and every
07:59 down each and every rabbit hole to to do
08:01 this uh conclusively in my opinion
08:03 anyways so it was refocused to atip i
08:05 took over in 2010 the programs continued
08:08 to go as a tip 2012 that initial
08:11 five-year funding dried up so we were
08:14 issued more funding in 2013-2014 08:17 unfortunately the the verbiage in the
08:20 way it was written
08:22 in the bill that when it finally came
08:24 out another office in the pentagon
08:27 took our money that was intended for our
08:29 office unfortunately
08:31 and i won't go into detail what office
08:33 that was but the office took it
08:35 and we were unable because nobody was
08:37 right into the program to step up and
08:39 say hey that money was intended for us
08:41 so um the program was indeed intended to
08:44 be funded well beyond 2012.
08:46 uh interaction between
08:48 you and your group and the asap bigelow
08:52 bass
08:53 conversations back and forth you've got
08:55 to get no idea what they're doing
08:56 brutally of course yeah we didn't we
08:58 didn't do anything without talking to
09:00 each other what about skinwalker ranch
09:01 did you get reports on that or can you
09:03 say uh
09:05 i would prefer to defend for that
09:07 question if that's okay
09:09 um
09:10 let's let's do a hypothetical the kinds
09:11 of phenomena that have been described
09:13 there that were investigated by bigelow
09:15 both as bass and as nids
09:19 are confounding in the sense they never
09:21 repeat and that same thing doesn't
09:23 happen again it almost seems to be like
09:25 the approach would be to study it as an
09:28 intelligence issue than a scientific
09:29 issue or as an intelligence well i think
09:31 there's always an intelligence aspect to
09:34 any big question right
09:36 you have to ask questions you know let's
09:38 let's let's take the the nature of
09:40 skinwalker out of the equation and just
09:42 look at it from an intelligence problem
09:44 you have to ask yourself a is this
09:46 something that is
09:47 naturally occurring is this something
09:49 that is being deliberately done is this
09:52 something that another nation could be
09:53 behind trying to influence us or is this
09:56 something that is occurring um
09:59 that is just a uh a natural part of
10:03 being a human being on this planet right
10:05 and and
10:06 a bunch of other possibilities as well
10:08 so we're looking at things
10:10 with
10:11 through this through the
10:13 optic of
10:14 trying to determine exactly
10:17 what are these things that are being
10:20 detected
10:21 that are being observed that are being
10:23 reported
10:24 and is it something that is naturally
10:26 occurring or not and when i say
10:28 naturally occurring doesn't necessarily
10:29 mean
10:30 naturally occurring as part of a weather
10:32 pattern
10:34 this is an awfully big universe we live
10:36 in and we now realize
10:38 uh
10:39 through theories such as string theory
10:42 and m theory
10:43 that the universe in which we live in
10:45 may be part of a much
10:47 bigger neighborhood of universe as part
10:49 of a multiverse which resides within one
10:51 great big superverse
10:54 and
10:54 this is not
10:56 just mere speculation there is
10:58 scientific evidence right now that even
11:00 some very serious scientists are looking
11:02 at
11:03 uh give you a case in point
11:05 the lopsided supposed lopsided nature of
11:07 our universe when a hand grenade blows
11:09 up it tends to blow up in a somewhat
11:11 symmetrical pattern and yet
11:13 here is our universe supposedly
11:15 originating from a big bang and it seems
11:18 lopsided and so some scientists now have
11:20 speculated it could be that way because
11:23 of the gravitational force from a
11:25 neighboring universe those gravity
11:27 effects are actually affecting our
11:30 universe over here right
11:32 is it proven no but it is a theory and
11:35 so i think whenever it comes to things
11:37 like skin walker ranch or anywhere else
11:41 i think we have to keep an open mind
11:43 again
11:44 20 years ago
11:46 my cell phone my ipad maybe 30 years ago
11:49 was was paranormal right it was
11:51 supernatural witchcraft voodoo
11:54 and now it's routine
11:56 i think when you get into quantum
11:58 mechanics and you realize
12:01 things such as duality principle and
12:03 tangled particles you realize this
12:05 universe is far more complex than we had
12:07 ever even imagined and we have to take
12:10 that into account that that there are
12:11 things that that may
12:14 go bump in the night
12:16 and we just need to figure out what
12:17 those things are

00:00 one of the most intriguing sentences in
00:02 the New York Times report mentioned an
00:04 exotic material of unknown origin that
00:07 was at Bigelow Aerospace for a while is
00:11 that from a crash do you think crashes
00:13 have happened detailed proof the crashes
00:23 have happened would be still highly
00:25 classified piece of data well that's an
00:33 answer of sorts yeah there there have
00:35 been there there has been one leaked
00:38 document how it got leaked oh I'll never
00:41 know which is out there that talks about
00:44 some crashes that we were able to verify
00:49 what was was a real document so my
00:52 opinion is that there probably is the
00:56 Ark probably at least materials now
00:59 would necessarily have to be crash of an
01:01 entire craft but it could be you know a
01:04 piece blown off and whatever by a
01:07 lightning strike or a missile or
01:10 whatever so so I'm not surprised to find
01:13 out that there's discussion of material
01:17 being available we've had an opportunity
01:23 to look at some unusual material and so
01:26 I think that's a that's a big area that
01:30 will become more significant as time
01:34 goes on I like you're killing me how you
01:37 had a chance to look at some material I
01:41 did and the interesting thing about it
01:46 was that couldn't figure out a very
01:49 complex material when you talk to people
01:53 that are doing this kind of research you
01:55 find out you know it isn't that you know
01:57 all the elements the periodic table we
01:59 know about so you're not finding some
02:02 new element that you didn't realize was
02:04 in the periodic table no it's more like
02:07 putting together
02:09 layered layers of various kinds of
02:15 material you would expect to be able to
02:17 be layered and that the result at the
02:21 end of the day is that it has certain
02:23 unusual characteristics that you
02:26 wouldn't have predicted in advance so
02:31 that's not the kind of thing that to
02:34 physicist is the most interesting

00:00 or Lincoln US 95 and an Road let's go
00:03 you're watching eight news now at six a
00:07 secret Pentagon program to study unknown
00:09 aerial objects otherwise known as UFOs
00:12 may not be finished after all the
00:14 civilian contractor for the program was
00:15 Bigelow Aerospace which was based here
00:17 in Las Vegas their contract though ended
00:19 in 2012 but the man who managed the
00:21 program inside the Pentagon he thinks
00:24 it's still operating George Knapp of the
00:25 i-team is here with more on his
00:27 exclusive story tonight his name is Luis
00:29 Elizondo and most of us first heard his
00:31 name last October when he stood on a
00:33 stage with rock star Tom DeLonge and
00:35 other Berman insiders Elizondo spent 10 00:38 years as head of a secret study of
00:40 unidentified aerial objects he was also
00:43 instrumental in the release of official
00:45 UFO videos recorded by military pilots
00:48 we sat down with him earlier this week
00:50 to ask among other things why the
00:52 Pentagon considers UFOs to be a
00:54 potential threat is it a threat if it's
00:58 a threat is of Russian is it Chinese and
00:59 yet these were all normal questions you
01:02 would ask whether you're dealing with
01:03 terrorism or weapons of mass destruction
01:05 or any issued to shore right nationals
01:06 creation to shore and yet here we are
01:09 with something that doesn't fit doesn't
01:12 fit doesn't fit Lewis Elizondo has spent
01:16 most of his adult life protecting his
01:18 country on active duty in combat
01:20 hotspots handling terrorists at
01:23 Guantanamo and at the Pentagon where he
01:25 was the point man for a tip the advanced
01:28 aerial threat identification program the
01:31 program collected and analyzed
01:32 information about encounters between the
01:35 US military and spectacular but unknown
01:38 technology what some would call UFOs my
01:42 job in the government at the time really
01:44 with guarding a tip was to twofold to
01:47 determine what it was and how it worked
01:50 not really focusing on as I said before
01:53 who's behind the steering wheel are
01:55 their intent I figured if we can answer
01:57 at least those two first things
01:58 everything else we'll be able to explain
02:00 later
02:00 Elizondo says even his immediate
02:02 supervisor in the Pentagon was unaware
02:05 of the program
02:07 the word threat is built into the name a
02:11 tip and even though the unidentified
02:13 craft being reported didn't launch an
02:16 Independence Day type attack on humanity
02:18 or zap major cities with death rays the
02:21 Defense Department had to consider the
02:23 possibilities the so called ticked at
02:26 UFO for instance was detected over
02:28 several days in 2004 by personnel with
02:32 the USS Nimitz battle group off the
02:34 coast of San Diego
02:36 it didn't attack but it demonstrated
02:38 vast superiority over America's most
02:41 advanced defense systems I think if you
02:44 were to take this issue that we've seen
02:46 you have something coming into our
02:49 airspace or the airspace we control that
02:52 has maybe a a Russian star on the tail
02:56 or has North Korean tail numbers I think
02:59 people would have a much different
03:01 reaction and response because there's
03:04 something we can identify and say that
03:05 is in our airspace and shouldn't be here
03:07 you DoD you CIA you DHS have the
03:12 responsibility of protecting us how did
03:15 this happen and yet here we have that
03:17 same scenario but there are no flags and
03:21 tail numbers on the tail in fact there
03:22 may not even be a tail on some of these
03:24 things and yet it's crickets nobody
03:26 wants to have the conversation in 2007 a
03:29 small group of senators led by Devadas
03:32 Harry Reid initiated a program to change
03:35 the culture surrounding UFO reports Reid
03:38 was motivated in part because of
03:40 classified reports he'd read about UFO
03:43 encounters over US nuclear bases in
03:45 which atomic weapons were somehow
03:47 disabled communications in the missile
03:51 defense and so was shut down didn't
03:54 happen to once more than once we have
03:58 things and ships at sea these things in
04:01 the water what is that the programs set
04:04 up by the Pentagon to assist a tip was
04:06 housed at Bigelow Aerospace in Southern
04:09 Nevada the contract ended in 2012 but
04:13 Elizondo believes some version of the
04:15 study is still ongoing he thinks it
04:17 makes sense to study tic-tacs and other
04:20 UFOs
04:21 compares it to how you might react if
04:23 someone pierced your home security
04:25 system the first thing you do is you
04:27 come down your stairs as you look in
04:29 your living room you see muddy boot
04:31 prints in your living room on the carpet
04:33 that weren't there the night before now
04:35 nothing's been taken out of your house
04:37 nothing's been disturbed no one's been
04:39 harmed and yet every night despite you
04:42 locking the front doors and the windows
04:43 and turning the alarm on there are muddy
04:45 boot prints I keep showing up on your
04:47 carpet now is that a threat one other
04:51 reason it's seen as a potential national
04:52 security issue is that loo Elizondo and
04:55 Senator Reid say they've seen
04:56 indications at both Russia and China are
04:59 studying this as well and if our
05:01 adversaries figure out the technology
05:03 before we do it could be trouble tonight
05:05 at 11 what about those UFO videos are
05:08 they legit much more to come oh it's
05:10 always so fascinating yeah yeah 

==========zhvClGiBB2c==========

00:00 when you have the testimony of many
00:03 pilots flying together and witnessing an
00:06 event and these are individuals who have
00:08 top-secret clearances by the way these
00:10 are trained observers we spent millions
00:12 of dollars in training them to be keen
00:14 observers when they tell you this
00:16 doesn't fit a normal profile we need to
00:19 listen people will tell you it's IR
00:25 glare and they have these weird ideas
00:27 that is some sort of 747 from far away
00:30 the bottom line is they don't know there
00:36 would be a national uproar here that we
00:38 could have an aircraft that we did not
00:41 control in our air spaces people would
00:42 have been fired there'd be congressional
00:44 testimony and here we have the same
00:46 situation but because there's no Russian
00:48 tail number or there's no North Korean
00:50 flag on the aircraft its cricket nobody
00:53 wants to have the conversation on
00:58 December 17 2017 important and historic
01:03 article has been published on the front
01:05 page of New York Times it was written by
01:09 journalists Helen Cooper
01:11 Ralph Blumenthal and Leslie Kane the
01:13 article was titled
01:15 real UFOs question mark Pentagon unit
01:19 tried to know one day earlier the same
01:22 article was published in digital form on
01:25 New York Times website this important
01:29 article described US Department of
01:32 Defense program titled advanced
01:35 aerospace threat indentification program
01:38 which was formed back in 2007 and the
01:42 mandate was to investigate and evaluate
01:45 UFOs in the context of potential
01:48 aerospace threats exposed existence of
01:52 this program opens a lot of new
01:55 implications about the long debated
01:58 question on reality of UFOs so I decided
02:02 to get into contact with the main
02:04 protagonist who was a member of that DoD
02:06 program which is mr. Lewis Alexander the
02:09 former director of the advanced
02:10 aerospace threatened notification
02:13 and as far as I know by the date of this
02:16 release this will be the longest
02:18 interview with mr. Elizondo that will be
02:21 available in public domain we had more
02:24 time to go into deeper questions this
02:27 interview was conducted on January 15 02:31 2018 vile
02:33 I was on my journalistic assignments in
02:36 Croatia and the segments from this
02:38 interview will be aired on creation and
02:41 national television in the near future
02:43 however since I am considering this
02:46 interview to be of extreme importance I
02:49 have decided to release it in the uncut
02:52 the full form so it could be a part of
02:55 public record and the public service and
02:58 I would like to thank a very good and
03:01 kind colleague who turned this planned
03:04 interview of mine into reality I was
03:07 also honored to speak with mr. Elizondo
03:10 and he was such a gentleman and
03:12 professional who granted me one hour of
03:14 his time so once again this is a full
03:17 one hour interview with mr. Louis
03:19 Alexander and I'm your host Giuliano man
03:23 in college
03:24 Thank You mr. Elizondo for granted me
03:27 this interview I was thinking that first
03:29 we could start with your career and
03:31 after that I have created several
03:34 questions where we will go deeper into a
03:36 DoD program absolutely no problem they
03:39 feel free to ask me any question you
03:41 want if there is something I cannot
03:44 answer because it remained classified or
03:47 sensitive I will of course let you know
03:49 but if it's unclassified I will
03:52 absolutely answer it for you
03:53 yeah yeah I completely understand that
03:56 part too whenever you change there are
03:58 any sensitivities inside any question
04:01 just let me know and I will back off so
04:04 no worries because I was signal
04:06 intelligence specialists myself so I
04:09 completely understand your position so I
04:12 guess for the beginning can you tell us
04:14 something about your bio and your career
04:17 so the listeners and viewers could get
04:19 better insights about you as a person
04:22 I'm sure after college
04:27 I joined the army the army like for for
04:32 many people offers opportunities both
04:34 experienced and financially that that
04:37 help pay for college I had a large
04:40 college bill and I always had this
04:42 desire to serve so for me it was a
04:45 natural decision to join the army
04:47 because I could serve my country and at
04:49 the same time minimize some of the
04:52 financial burden that I had incurred
04:54 while going to college and and studying
04:57 microbiology and immunology and the
05:00 scientists that I did so I joined the
05:02 army and when I went into the Army I was
05:05 a counterintelligence special agent so I
05:09 was I did investigations espionage and
05:12 terrorism investigations and I was in
05:16 the Army for a fairly short period of
05:17 time once my obligation was up I was
05:22 then brought into a Special Operations
05:25 program special program on the civilian
05:28 side and so I worked with the
05:31 intelligence community and the
05:33 Department of Defense the rest of my
05:35 career as a civilian and living abroad
05:40 in places like Latin America the Middle
05:44 East Afghanistan and and whatnot so
05:48 prior to September 11 most of my career
05:51 emphasis was on Latin America so Central
05:54 America South America the Caribbean but
05:58 immediately following the the events of
06:00 September 11th my career shifted and I
06:03 focused primarily on the Middle East so
06:06 I spent a good deal of time there and I
06:10 was able to serve with some fantastic
06:12 human beings like mattis so James
06:16 Madison's the Secretary of Defense I had
06:19 the honor and privilege to to serve with
06:22 him in combat and it is there that I I
06:26 was able to observe myself
06:28 the type of person the truly incredible
06:31 person that he he really is if you were
06:36 to ask me
06:37 and others have served with him we would
06:39 all tell you he is truly an American
06:41 Hero
06:42 and he is the very best of the best that
06:44 we have not so jokingly I think if he
06:51 were to run for president this next
06:53 election he'd probably have a lot of
06:55 supporters like us and then from there I
07:00 owned up running investigation so I was
07:04 early in my career as a civilian I was
07:07 the special agent in charge of several
07:09 offices and then from there I moved to
07:12 DC my wife I think was getting tired of
07:15 me deploying all the time and my family
07:19 my young daughters wanted to spend more
07:21 time with me so I took a promotion I
07:23 came to Washington DC and I spent the
07:25 rest of my career here working at places
07:28 such as a National counterintelligence
07:30 executive the Office of the Director of
07:33 National Intelligence and of course back
07:36 here at the Department of Defense yeah
07:39 and I think also what I was able to find
07:42 you are of course well it's a rich
07:45 career and you're also a technical
07:47 tinkerer - because you hold several
07:50 patents and I was able to find one
07:54 titled never ship empty right so maybe
07:57 you could talk a little bit about that -
07:59 it looks like a fascinating concept you
08:06 know I think everybody has a hobby
08:10 some people like to watch rugby some
08:12 people like to go to bars some people
08:16 like to ride motorcycles and shoot guns
08:20 for me I've always been a little bit of
08:23 an introvert I prefer to to stay quiet
08:28 and I am an inventor I look at things
08:36 how we can make processes better how we
08:39 can make things better whether they be
08:42 in actually mechanical instruments or
08:47 they are business processes I believe
08:51 we can always improve I'm almost
08:53 everything that we do as mankind and it
08:56 is in the pursuit of those improvements
08:58 that I find myself being an inventor
09:03 I think it for me it is an outlet that
09:06 allows me to to not only be creative but
09:10 also to help if I can mankind in just a
09:14 very minor way you know become more
09:19 efficient yet better at doing things
09:22 faster at doing things improving
09:24 productivity and input and throughput
09:26 and output I think I think we as mankind
09:30 it's in our DNA and I think it's in our
09:32 genetics to to improve on things and to
09:35 explore and so ironically I found the
09:38 last 10 years of my life both privately
09:41 and and officially in those two rules
09:44 roles that is improving and exploring oh
09:48 yeah and I think this specific patent
09:52 never ship empty was dealing with ship
09:55 cargoes so the idea was for the main
09:58 base of the ship to be easily detached
10:01 so the time would not be spent on
10:03 sorting the cargo itself right yes sir
10:06 that that was one of them I wanted to
10:09 help try to improve throughput I I spent
10:14 a good deal of the time on the water and
10:16 there's a lot of inefficiencies right
10:18 now 90% of the world's cargo moves by
10:20 boat and these container boats are are
10:25 very efficient because of economy of
10:27 scale but the the one if you will change
10:31 in the armor is when they come to port
10:34 and when they try to offload and load
10:35 it's still very very archaic it's still
10:38 very very labor-intensive and it is not
10:42 an efficient process at all so that was
10:45 the bottleneck that we were trying to
10:47 address and now we will speak about of
10:51 course the main news and main role of
10:54 yours during recent media wave and that
10:58 is the advanced aerospace threat
11:02 identification
11:03 Oh Graham that DoD program was described
11:07 in historical New York Times article
11:10 from December 16 2017 I guess the name
11:15 itself describes the mandate in general
11:18 terms but maybe you can expand on that
11:21 what was the meaning of that program and
11:23 what was the mandate in actual sense
11:26 sure so I think your summation is
11:31 absolutely correct
11:32 Advanced aerospace threat identification
11:35 program was established to do just that
11:38 identify any threats I think there's
11:41 been some confusion recently some folks
11:43 had said advanced airborne it was never
11:45 airborne it was advanced aerospace so
11:48 these are potentially objects that are
11:52 both in our atmosphere and maybe not in
11:55 our atmosphere that are maneuvering in
11:58 such a way that they don't fit a common
12:02 profile of what we know to be typical
12:06 type of aircraft whether they be drones
12:09 whether they be missiles whether there
12:11 be whether maybe airplanes these are
12:15 objects that are defying the traditional
12:19 profile of something we would normally
12:22 consider to be a an aircraft of some
12:27 sort and so as a result the Department
12:31 of Defense takes seriously anything that
12:34 it cannot identify positively we have to
12:38 presume it can be a threat until it is
12:42 proven it is not a threat and so that
12:45 was the the purpose of the program was
12:48 to identify these anomalies these
12:50 phenomena that did not fit easily into a
12:54 category of or a profile that we we know
12:59 there are some media reports that I
13:02 could see about the timeline of the
13:04 project I mean for me the timeline is
13:07 clear because I watched all the media
13:09 pieces that I was able to collect still
13:13 it would be good to clear that up for
13:15 the listeners be
13:16 cause there were some contradicting
13:18 articles on that note maybe you can tell
13:21 us when the program was formed initially
13:25 when you became the formal director sure
13:28 how the program's budget was affected
13:32 through the years and especially what
13:34 was happening after 2012 with the
13:37 program
13:38 sure sure so Juliano I the program
13:41 started in 2007 the tooth then in 2007 13:46 it was a bipartisan effort which is
13:49 something the media I think has missed
13:51 here this was in this country we have
13:54 the two major parties the the Democrats
13:57 and the Republicans in this particular
13:59 case it was Senator Harry Reid along
14:02 with Senator Stevens who is Republican
14:05 and Senator anyway all three of them are
14:07 veterans along with the support of
14:09 Senator John Glenn who is an astronaut
14:11 and and all of them have served their
14:15 country very honorably and so through
14:18 various reporting that they they had in
14:21 fact Stephens in as a pilot reported
14:24 being chased by by something by a
14:26 phenomena so these are these are
14:29 individuals who are who are absolutely
14:32 heroes for for our country and they are
14:36 reporting that they believe there is
14:37 something out there that we need to look
14:39 at so the program was established as a
14:41 bipartisan effort
14:42 it was then sent to to one of the
14:46 defense agencies within the Department
14:48 of Defense there was an open bid anybody
14:51 could bid for the contract and it turned
14:53 out that that Bigelow Aerospace won the
14:57 contract keep in mind this wasn't
15:00 selected by read this was an independent
15:02 internal process by the Defense
15:05 Intelligence Agency for this contract it
15:08 was dia who chose who has a contract not
15:12 Senator Reid so I think that's an
15:14 important detail that gets lost and then
15:17 in 2008 I was asked to come on board by
15:20 the former program manager to provide
15:22 counterintelligence support within this
15:25 this this portfolio I did not have any
15:28 idea what this program was about
15:30 I had several meetings with people until
15:33 I realized more or less what this was
15:36 about
15:37 and then in 2010 when the last program
15:40 manager was was going into a new
15:43 assignment I was asked to take over the
15:46 program and I subsequently accepted it
15:49 and from 2010 to roughly three and a
15:52 half months ago I ran the 8a program now
15:55 the funding the initial tranche of
15:57 funding ended in 2012 then in 2013 there
16:01 was additional funding that came through
16:03 the Department
16:04 unfortunately the wording in the the
16:06 language for the funds was a little bit
16:09 nebulous a little bit general so another
16:11 office within the department wound up
16:13 taking that money and using it for their
16:15 purposes but it wasn't it was indeed
16:17 intended for us and and then we
16:21 continued to run the program obviously
16:23 with a lot a lot less support until
16:26 about three and a half months ago and I
16:30 cannot tell you now if the program is up
16:32 and running because I am no longer a
16:35 employee of the US government and I am
16:38 NOT allowed to speak on behalf of the
16:40 government but what I can tell you is up
16:42 until the day I left the program was
16:44 alive and well it was fairly robust we
16:48 had some incredible men and women who
16:49 were part of this effort and I had
16:52 support from my senior very senior
16:55 levels of leadership that the program
16:58 was in fact to be turned over to one of
17:01 my successors and that was effectively
17:03 done yeah and that is a very important
17:06 part that you just cleared up some
17:09 people were confused and they were
17:10 thinking that after 2012 and after 22 17:14 million dollar budget was spent that the
17:17 program ended and some people were
17:19 commenting like why you waited so long
17:22 to step out after 2012 but obviously the
17:26 program had continuation all the way and
17:28 it was present after 2012 so thank you
17:32 so much for clearing that up
17:35 thank you also for explaining dia and
17:38 Robert Bigelow contracting process at
17:41 that point was definitely lost by the
17:43 media
17:44 again like you said some media outlets
17:47 for example we're attacking greed
17:49 thinking that there was some moderation
17:51 with money so that was a very important
17:55 point that you just explained I would
17:58 like now to move the conversation to the
18:00 technical side detection of ufp
18:03 phenomena probably involves very
18:07 sophisticated sensors and data that was
18:10 extracted from to DoD platforms so I
18:14 would also think that such a fact alone
18:16 should be the first step to evaluate is
18:19 this phenomena just folklore or is it a
18:22 technically detectable manifestation as
18:25 something physical
18:26 so can you expand on that as I think
18:30 that is a key point in researching this
18:33 phenomena sure so I think it's important
18:37 first for for your readers or your
18:39 listeners to understand that the two
18:42 videos that came out were just very
18:44 small samples of additional data that is
18:48 that the program collected and by the
18:50 way certainly after 2012 in some cases
18:54 but I can't go much beyond that but what
18:57 I can say is that in each case the
19:00 videos provide specific detailed
19:04 information that would allow an expert
19:07 whether you are and radar operator or
19:09 your electro-optical specialist to look
19:12 at the videos and determine is this
19:15 something that we have seen before
19:16 keeping in mind our effort was a very
19:19 comprehensive effort we didn't just rely
19:21 on videos we didn't just rely on radar
19:24 we didn't just rely on eyewitness
19:26 testimony it was an amalgamation of all
19:29 that data put ever that allowed us to to
19:32 build a profile of what we were seeing
19:34 and in some cases we would receive
19:36 information that we could figure out
19:38 fairly quickly what it was but
19:40 unfortunately there were many many
19:44 instances that because of the flight
19:47 performance characteristics and what we
19:50 were seeing and what we were being told
19:51 of what we were were able to track on
19:53 radar defied any such no
19:57 profile of any aircraft in any worlds
20:00 inventory so from that perspective when
20:03 you have the testimony of pilots not a
20:07 pilot but many pilots flying together
20:10 and witnessing an event and these are
20:12 individuals who have top-secret
20:13 clearances they are in charge of
20:16 multi-million dollar weapon platforms
20:18 some cases they are trusted to fly over
20:21 US cities with live munition and so when
20:24 they are telling you they're seeing
20:25 something by the way these are trained
20:27 observers we spent millions of dollars
20:29 in training them to be keen observers
20:32 when they tell you this doesn't fit a
20:34 normal profile we need to listen we and
20:38 I think there's a stigma about this that
20:40 nobody wants to talk about but these
20:42 folks are trained to fight wars on our
20:44 behalf we trust them to fight and win
20:47 wars and yet we don't trust them to tell
20:49 us they're seeing something they can't
20:50 identify and on top of that we have the
20:53 video and then you also have the the
20:56 radar returns I also think it's
20:58 important to note I think there's been
21:00 some discussion by the media that I
21:01 purposely leaked these videos that is
21:04 not the case these videos went through
21:07 an official review process through the
21:10 Pentagon per the directive per DOD
21:12 directive and then furthermore an
21:14 additional step foreign disclosure team
21:17 the senior-most foreign disclosure team
21:19 also reviewed these these videos and
21:22 agreed that they were unclassified the
21:24 intent for the videos was to establish
21:27 an unclassified community of interest or
21:30 if you will a virtual environment that
21:32 would allow everybody to look at this
21:34 and help us determine what signatures we
21:37 were seeing and by the way did anybody
21:39 else out there see anything similar that
21:42 can help us figure out what these things
21:44 are and and to this day no one has has a
21:49 conversation but no one has been able to
21:51 figure out what these are so as as as
21:54 much negative press people are putting
21:58 on these videos I haven't had anyone
22:00 come up to me and tell me definitively
22:02 what it is and I think that's very
22:05 frustrating because I people will tell
22:07 you it's you know IR glare or
22:10 I are fuzz and they have these weird
22:13 ideas that it's some sort of 747 from
22:16 far away but bottom line is they don't
22:18 know and I think we need to have a
22:21 conversation collectively and and we
22:24 need to not just look at the video we
22:26 need to look at the radar returns we
22:28 need to talk to the pilots because when
22:31 we look at one piece of information it's
22:33 very easy for us to make presumptions
22:35 and assumptions of what we think it
22:38 might be but in the end you have to have
22:41 all the information in front of you
22:43 before you can make that conclusion and
22:45 I believe that there are people now that
22:47 are jumping to conclusions without
22:50 having all the facts and I think that's
22:52 very dangerous because what it does it
22:54 puts in the minds of people that what we
22:57 are looking at is simply a an
22:59 atmospheric anomaly and and look radar
23:05 returns don't track it
23:06 atmospheric anomalies and pilots don't
23:08 see atmospheric anomalies moving at
23:10 hypersonic speeds above the water and
23:13 atmospheric anomalies isn't going to
23:15 affect the turb the water the way these
23:17 things are doing and there's a lot of
23:19 commonality here that unfortunately we
23:21 have not been able to talk about because
23:23 I'm not sure I'm allowed to talk about
23:24 that paint a very compelling picture
23:27 that these are not this is not IR glare
23:30 we're looking at this is a real tangible
23:32 object maneuvering in a way that is
23:35 remains unexplained to this day they are
23:38 by definition they are an object they
23:41 are unidentified and they are flying so
23:44 you know I now truth be told I think the
23:48 word UFO is all in the eye of the
23:49 beholder I think if you were to talk to
23:52 a remote village in the South Pacific in
23:57 World War two and they have seen a b-17 24:00 fly over the island they may call that a
24:05 UFO they would say we've never seen that
24:06 before that is a UFO and in fact we
24:08 still have now these these cargo
24:11 religions right now in the South Pacific
24:13 dedicated to aircraft now we know them
24:16 to be simply technological vehicles but
24:19 to somebody who's never seen one they
24:21 are technically an unidentified flying
24:23 object
24:24 so the question remains Giuliano what as
24:26 a people do we want to do is this
24:29 important enough for us to collectively
24:31 look at and determine is this a problem
24:34 keeping in mind these things maybe over
24:36 our airspace
24:37 our controlled airspace and these are
24:39 things that we have no idea what they
24:41 are we have no idea how they work and
24:43 there's nothing we can do about it
24:45 so from a national security perspective
24:47 one has to ask the question is it a
24:50 threat maybe it's not a threat and let
24:52 me if I may digress for just a moment
24:54 and give you another example sure if I
24:57 may ask you Giuliano do you lock your
24:59 front door at night when you go to bed
25:01 no are you you mean the outside door
25:05 right yeah the outside door absolutely
25:07 yeah
25:08 absolutely right and we do that to be to
25:10 be cautious we don't expect anything to
25:13 come in but just in case well let me ask
25:15 you this let's say every night you went
25:18 to lock your front door every night you
25:20 locked your windows and every night you
25:22 set your alarm and every morning you
25:25 wake up there are muddy footprints in
25:28 your living room carpet with and and
25:32 there are these muddy footprints that
25:34 lead to nowhere nothing has been taken
25:37 from your home nothing has been
25:39 disturbed but there are a muddy
25:40 footprints each morning in your front
25:43 living room now I would ask you is that
25:46 a threat the answer is we don't know but
25:49 the fact that you are locking your doors
25:51 you're locking your windows and you're
25:52 turning on your alarm system and somehow
25:55 someway something is getting into your
25:57 house you have to be you have to presume
26:00 it could be a threat until we're sure
26:02 it's not yeah and it's a definitely an
26:05 intrusion that should be investigated
26:08 100% and that's a great analogy and I
26:11 also wanted to raise the issue that some
26:13 people were trying to interpret the
26:16 videos and give their interpretation as
26:19 an airplane in the distance like you
26:21 said but I think this is the key point
26:24 now right the correlation of multiple
26:26 data they are just watching at a very
26:28 small sample out of context sort of if
26:32 they are only looking at a video without
26:34 taking into consideration the overall
26:36 situation
26:38 and on top of that the AAT program was
26:42 filtering out prosaic cases already on
26:45 the source right right and if I may go
26:51 one step further
26:52 maybe these are adversarial aircraft
26:56 it's possible but if these are
26:58 adversarial aircraft that are displaying
27:00 such futuristic technologies and
27:04 technically advanced technologies and we
27:06 are obligated to figure out who they
27:08 belong to more importantly this has been
27:11 going on for decades so whoever has this
27:13 technology has had this technology for a
27:16 very long time which is even more
27:18 alarming so no matter where these things
27:21 are from I believe we have a a patriotic
27:25 and a moral obligation to figure out
27:28 what these things are and how these
27:30 things work absolutely should be the
27:33 mandate of DoD or any other military
27:37 institution and I think that leads us to
27:40 another question and that is the fact
27:42 that your program was able to identify
27:44 five basic and also fascinating
27:48 categories about performance of these
27:51 objects so maybe you can expand on those
27:54 I think we are speaking about low
27:57 observability positive lift and so on
28:01 yeah so I think it is when you look at
28:04 these there's there's five common
28:06 observations we continue to see or
28:08 observables we continue to see with
28:10 these things that would would require us
28:15 to have a very good understanding of
28:18 advanced physics and those observables
28:20 can be can be categorized as follows so
28:24 the first observable is sudden and
28:26 instantaneous acceleration these are
28:29 objects that are moving in a manner that
28:31 if there was a biological system inside
28:34 it it would should not be able to
28:37 withstand those type of sudden g-forces
28:39 any any biological system that we are
28:43 aware of to include wearing G suits and
28:46 whatnot would not be able to withstand
28:48 these g-forces at all
28:49 the second thing
28:51 is hypersonic velocities and not just
28:54 supersonic but hypersonic an object
28:56 moving well above the limitations of
28:59 supersonic speed and objects that are
29:02 moving in a way that don't have any any
29:04 apparent signature related to that so
29:06 there's no heat trail coming off the
29:08 object that's moving very fast through
29:10 the atmosphere
29:11 there's no sonic boom of these objects
29:13 so things that would traditionally be
29:15 associated with objects moving at very
29:17 fast speeds even though we can see them
29:20 moving that fast we don't see a
29:22 signature the third observable would be
29:25 it's a bit of an oxymoron but it's low
29:27 observability so whether you're looking
29:31 at these things electro optically
29:33 through let's say a gun camera or you're
29:35 looking at these things with a naked eye
29:37 or you're looking at the radar in the
29:39 end we are using the electromagnetic
29:41 spectrum to try to figure out what these
29:44 things look like and unfortunately what
29:47 we're getting as a recurrent seems to be
29:49 a bit nonsensical it's it's we are
29:52 looking at objects that people will
29:54 describe well the semi metallic is I
29:56 didn't really get a good view of it I
29:58 could see it but it didn't look it
30:00 didn't look like anything I've ever seen
30:01 it was a bit fuzzy in other cases you
30:04 look at the gun camera and you see an
30:06 object there but it's just it you cannot
30:08 see it's almost impossible to actually
30:11 see the object instead of seeing what is
30:13 around the object and in other cases
30:14 radar returns coming back nonsensical
30:17 despite having the best of the best
30:20 radar we might take up glimpse and
30:23 pieces of it here and there and then all
30:24 of us and our radars get you know either
30:27 turned off or a radar can't pick
30:29 something up so the low observable would
30:31 be the third the fourth observable is
30:33 basically an object that has the ability
30:36 to move in atoms the various layers of
30:38 the Earth's atmosphere possibly even in
30:42 outer space and possibly even through
30:44 water seemingly without any type of
30:47 normal resistance associated friction
30:51 associated with objects moving in that
30:54 manner through through through through a
30:56 medium and then the last but not least
30:58 is and probably the most important is
31:00 positive lift the last observable is an
31:04 object
31:05 apparently resisting the natural effects
31:08 of Earth's gravity yet without the
31:11 normally associated aerodynamic
31:14 structures that would require an object
31:17 either have lift or thrust so no visible
31:21 engines no visible engine exhaust plumes
31:25 no no wings no rudders no ailerons no
31:31 fins and yet able to maneuver in a very
31:34 precise manner in in our atmosphere
31:37 despite not having any of these
31:40 characteristics so I think those five
31:42 observables when you see them all
31:44 together then we are forced to scratch
31:48 our head and and and figure out now
31:53 maybe we don't maybe we don't know what
31:56 these things are
31:57 absolutely and all these are very
31:59 important clues that leads me to
32:02 absolutely fascinating case that was a
32:05 part of one of two released videos and
32:08 that is a USS Nimitz case from November
32:12 2004 which summarized most of these
32:16 animalistic and exotic performances can
32:20 you give us a short summary about that
32:22 case I read it myself so many times and
32:26 I'm always fascinated with it whenever I
32:28 read it again sure so a little bit about
32:33 the Nimitz case this is a case that
32:34 until recently nobody admitted ever
32:36 happened
32:38 this was the Nimitz were doing there
32:40 were cops off the coast of California in
32:42 2004 despite what people say I was 2005 32:46 we actually have a logbook so again this
32:48 is misinformation by I think well minded
32:51 people who don't have all the facts but
32:52 the bottom line it was in November 2004 32:55 that the event happened and I we learned
32:58 this I talked to for the pilots and we
33:00 actually have the written written
33:01 verification so we we know exactly when
33:04 the event occurred so it was a clear
33:08 morning off the coast of San Diego two
33:11 f-18 Super Hornets
33:12 commanded now that everybody knows by
33:16 commander flavor who is a commander
33:18 by the way the most elite of the elite
33:20 called the Black Aces if you ever had
33:24 the privilege and honor to meet this guy
33:25 he is truly an American Hero just just
33:28 like just like mattis he has paid his
33:32 dues and then some and he was leading
33:36 leading the pack if you will of f-18s
33:38 the two f-18s Jim slate was a backseater
33:42 and he was the Wiz oh and then you had
33:44 another f-18 which I don't know if the
33:47 identities as those pilots have come out
33:48 yet so I can't I can't release those
33:50 identities but again all trained
33:52 observers and in charge of multi-million
33:54 dollar weapon systems and as they were
33:56 doing the train ups with the Marine
33:58 Corps which were playing the the red
34:00 force they received a call from the
34:03 Princeton and they were Reeve entered to
34:04 a new location and they and as they were
34:06 being Ravech turd the two f-18s were
34:09 talking back and forth wondering if
34:11 maybe this was a drug interdiction or
34:13 something like that because apparently
34:15 it was it was it was it was live it
34:17 wasn't an exercise and at one point the
34:19 Princeton asked the f-18 to ask both of
34:22 them what were their loadouts what were
34:24 their weapon loadouts now keep in mind
34:25 their training so they shouldn't have
34:27 any weapon loadouts so they were
34:29 surprised by that unless this was a
34:31 real-world scenario you wouldn't need
34:33 weapons especially over the continental
34:37 United States and our territorial water
34:39 so that was strange and one of the
34:41 pilots had indicated to me they thought
34:43 maybe this was another September 11th
34:44 style attack and they were going to go
34:47 interdict something so as they finally
34:50 got to the place one of the one of the
34:54 radar operators on the net and the
34:56 Princeton hadn't formed flavor and the
34:59 other individuals that they were in
35:02 tracking these things over the last week
35:04 many many of these things sometimes up
35:07 to 20 of these things coming in out of
35:08 80,000 feet dropping down to 20,000 feet
35:11 in some cases just 50 feet over the
35:13 water and then popping right back up and
35:16 it's not that they were going to 80,000 35:19 feet and flying away we didn't track him
35:21 any more after that and so they were
35:23 maneuvering in a very odd way and so as
35:26 commander flavor and his folks got over
35:29 the target area they noticed the water
35:31 was perturbed and
35:32 oiling and an otherwise very calm steady
35:34 CC state very blue skies actual weather
35:39 conditions and the water was roiling and
35:42 as I looked down they saw this very fast
35:44 what looked like a white tic-tac flying
35:47 very fast over the water and so as
35:50 commander flavor tried to engage the
35:53 target the target began to outmaneuver
35:55 commander favored by the lane one of our
35:57 most sophisticated aircraft we had at
35:59 the time this thing was actually towing
36:02 with him to the point when commander
36:04 flavor finally tried to engage this
36:06 thing directly it took off and within he
36:10 said he expresses it as a couple seconds
36:12 and this is backed up by the radar it
36:14 was completely gone so taking off in a
36:18 position so it had initially orientated
36:21 it orientated itself towards commander
36:24 flavor as if as if guarding itself and
36:27 then as commander flavor came in to get
36:29 a closer look it shot off and more
36:32 importantly here not only did it fly off
36:34 at several thousands upon thousands of
36:36 miles an hour without a sonic boom or
36:38 anything like that no associated
36:40 signature within a minute or two of them
36:44 collecting their thoughts and heading
36:46 off to their next location
36:48 they were commander flavor was informed
36:51 that the object was now waiting for them
36:53 at their next at their next plot
36:57 location so somehow the object not only
37:00 outmaneuvered both aircraft very easily
37:03 but also managed to know where the next
37:07 occasion their next point on the map
37:10 that they were supposed to go to somehow
37:13 it knew that it was Emeralds maybe it
37:16 exploited the the electronic systems on
37:19 the aircraft or who knows but somehow
37:21 the object was waiting for them at their
37:23 next merge plot and that's a problem
37:25 so they cancelled their flight they went
37:28 back to the Nimitz and at that point
37:32 some folks were were were teasing them
37:36 obviously commander flavor and company
37:38 were not happy about it they were
37:41 concerned that this was a danger to them
37:43 and their aircraft in the mission
37:45 and so two more f-18s were launched
37:47 immediately after flavors folks had
37:50 returned and recovered on the ship and
37:51 it was those two f-18s that actually
37:55 took the footage of the one of the
37:57 videos that you see that is an
37:59 absolutely fascinating case I mean so
38:02 many layers and technical details your
38:05 program actually interviewed the pilots
38:08 right and you evaluated the case do know
38:12 was there any initial investigation that
38:15 happened back in 2004 or you actually
38:19 took the case originally as a first
38:21 party I can't answer precisely when an
38:25 investigation was actually launched a
38:27 very comprehensive investigation but
38:30 unfortunately I'm not at liberty to give
38:31 the precise time or by who did it
38:34 I believe that information may still
38:36 belong to the government so I have to be
38:38 I have to be cautious of that but an
38:40 investigation was in fact executed that
38:43 is that is correct thanks so much for
38:46 that there is another very interesting
38:48 section in The New York Times article I
38:51 know it's sensitive but I will mention
38:54 it it is related to alleged storage of
38:58 exotic material by Robert Bigelow
39:00 company which was a contractor of a ATP
39:05 program I know that you can go into it
39:08 but can you maybe give us some comments
39:10 at least in general terms sure so I
39:14 think it's important let me first clear
39:16 things up too so when the media was very
39:21 accurate in its in its reporting but one
39:24 part of was a little bit off and let me
39:26 explain what happened so when the
39:30 contract was let to to have a storage
39:32 facility the intent of that storage
39:35 facility was to be able to store any
39:38 type of sensitive information data or
39:41 material that might or could be
39:43 recovered in the future so whether or
39:46 not material has been actually recovered
39:48 and is stored in that facility I am
39:51 unable to comment but what I can tell
39:53 you is that the intent of that facility
39:55 was to be able should we needed to
39:58 store material information and data in a
40:01 secure manner now what type of material
40:03 are we talking about we're not talking
40:05 about
40:05 unidentified alloys that people continue
40:09 to to hit on what we are talking about
40:12 are actually we're talking about meta
40:14 materials whose whose isotopic ratios
40:17 are so unique that they are not found
40:21 here naturally on this planet and those
40:25 isotopes are isotopic ratios are in such
40:30 a way that technologically we it would
40:34 be exceptionally exceptionally expensive
40:37 for us to try to replicate and so that
40:42 is that is really when they say unknown
40:44 metal alloys it was an actually unknown
40:46 metal alloys it was meta materials to
40:49 have a radio isotopic ratio that is not
40:53 found here on this planet and therefore
40:55 the origins of those meta materials are
40:58 unknown and that is that is really how
41:02 it unfortunately should be portrayed but
41:05 understanding that everybody understands
41:07 this as a material scientist so I think
41:11 the the lay description although a
41:13 little bit misleading and not
41:16 intentionally someone had said metal
41:18 alloys when really were we're talking
41:19 about meta materials but I think
41:23 somewhere it got lost in translation and
41:24 someone said unknown alloys when it's
41:26 really metal meta materials with unknown
41:29 origins because of the isotopic ratio
41:32 now with that said everything that that
41:35 moves in our environment leaves some
41:38 sort of signature and sometimes that
41:40 signatures in the form of light and heat
41:42 sometimes it's in the form of sound
41:44 sometimes it's in the form of metal if
41:47 you look at a at an aircraft sitting on
41:50 the tarmac
41:50 sometimes bits and pieces which tire
41:53 might fall off sometimes fuel might leak
41:55 sometimes you know in rare instances a
41:58 piece of aircraft might actually fall
42:00 off of an aircraft if it's if it's
42:03 performing some extreme maneuvers so
42:05 from our perspective anything that
42:07 potentially could be left behind would
42:10 be enormous food
42:11 to to to better understand its
42:15 performance characteristics and perhaps
42:17 even its origins so from that
42:19 perspective yes any and everything that
42:22 could potentially be associated with one
42:24 of these phenomena is something that we
42:25 would want to get a whole get our hands
42:27 on and analyze yeah any type of residue
42:31 that could be used for later analysis
42:33 thanks so much for that and I think that
42:36 this whole discovery of this program is
42:39 actually historic from the sense that it
42:42 changes some so-called established
42:45 conclusions about the UFO phenomena
42:48 itself for example United States Air
42:51 Force had a program blue book from 40s
42:54 to 1969 that was concluded by Condon
42:58 committee from the University of
43:00 Colorado and whenever somebody asks or
43:05 inquires about the UFO phenomena
43:08 government is always presenting these
43:10 three conclusions by Condon committee
43:12 which are no UFO reported investigated
43:17 and evaluated by the Air Force was ever
43:21 an indication of threat to our national
43:24 security than they say there was no
43:27 evidence submitted to or discovered by
43:30 the Air Force that sightings categorized
43:33 as unidentified represented
43:36 technological developments or principles
43:39 beyond the range of modern scientific
43:41 knowledge and they also say on top of
43:45 that that there was no evidence
43:47 indicating that sightings categorized as
43:51 unidentified where extraterrestrial
43:54 vehicles and of quote but obviously some
43:58 of these points are now directly opposed
44:00 by your findings and by the facts that
44:03 your program discovered so do you have
44:06 any comment regarding that historic
44:09 evaluation by the Air Force and by the
44:11 Condon committee well I think the
44:13 department is a very big organization
44:15 and I think secretary Madison heritage
44:19 and organization have had a lot of
44:20 stovepipes and a lot of silos and in
44:23 addition to that there's been a great
44:24 deal of
44:25 booooo against anybody reporting this
44:30 information so I'm not surprised that
44:33 senior levels of the air force have
44:36 reported there has been no additional
44:38 sightings but not everybody in the
44:40 department necessarily knows what other
44:42 people are doing and in my role I was at
44:45 the OSD level so I said as part of the
44:49 office of secretary defense staff I
44:51 wasn't in the Air Force I wasn't with
44:54 the services I was more part of the
44:56 overhead if you will for the department
44:59 and I ran I ran several sensitive
45:02 programs so it's not uncommon that one
45:05 organization in the department doesn't
45:07 know about another organization's
45:09 efforts or activities
45:11 unfortunately that is that is that is
45:13 sometimes the case but keeping in mind
45:16 there's a lot of stigma and taboo here
45:18 and so there are a lot of people who may
45:21 officially not want to report this kind
45:23 of information because they are worried
45:25 about their security clearance they are
45:27 worried about they want to be kept on
45:28 flight status and they don't want to be
45:31 perceived as being crazy or fringe or
45:33 anything like that these are these are
45:35 patriots these are fantastic Americans
45:38 that are trying to do their job they do
45:40 it silently they do it diligently and
45:42 they do it professionally
45:43 and whenever any time you see something
45:46 like this you have an obligation to
45:49 report it but at the same time you you
45:52 don't want to lose your career and your
45:55 livelihood over something like this
45:57 so I it is perfectly understandable why
46:01 there was some resistance and hesitation
46:03 by many to have this conversation Jim
46:06 Don oh I'll tell you I I risked
46:08 everything to do this I'm not sure
46:10 people understand I I gave up a
46:12 fantastic career I was at the top of my
46:15 game I had tremendous respect in the
46:17 building and you know I gave up a
46:21 retirement a pension and everything to
46:24 do this I I you know a lot of people are
46:27 willing to do this as a hobby a lot of
46:29 people are willing to do this as as kind
46:32 of if you will as a side effort but this
46:36 was my job and and
46:39 coming out like this was very very
46:41 uncomfortable it was not easy I can
46:43 assure you I gave up from almost
46:46 everything to do this because I believed
46:48 in what I was doing and I believe that
46:50 the that the department must take this
46:53 seriously and there must be a way that
46:55 allows our people our folks our Patriots
46:59 our heroes to report this information up
47:01 through the chain without being worried
47:03 about any type of stigma or retribution
47:05 and I understood going out I was going
47:09 to get a tremendous amount of ridicule
47:11 and I'm still getting that ridicule
47:13 because people don't know my intentions
47:16 they they don't know what we did in the
47:19 last ten years and understandably some
47:21 people are mad I since I've left I've
47:24 received two threats from people inside
47:26 that building which to me is is is
47:29 almost unfathomable I've had my security
47:33 clearance threatened and then I had
47:36 someone call me and actually tell me
47:39 maybe I should be threatened for my
47:40 personal safety now that's kind of seems
47:43 crazy a little bit ridiculous I
47:44 understand but it nonetheless happened
47:47 and that's that's a problem for me
47:51 that's it's a problem because I'm I'm
47:53 trying to allow our country to have a
47:56 conversation and in the end this is not
47:59 under the fact that there are things we
48:01 can't explain is not the Providence of
48:03 any government or any institution it's
48:06 just like Galileo making the point that
48:08 the earth was not the center of the
48:10 solar system that is not a classifiable
48:13 fact so my point being is if this is
48:16 something that the American people think
48:19 is important enough to make a national
48:21 security priority then they need to have
48:23 a conversation and let them decide in
48:25 the end I really don't care what the
48:27 American people decide as long as they
48:29 have the ability to make that decision
48:31 themselves but to keep that information
48:34 from the American people and not even
48:35 have a conversation that is a problem
48:38 because if any of these things let me
48:40 give you an example if any of these
48:42 things were to come over the United
48:44 States territory or territorial waters
48:47 or controlled areas and they had let's
48:49 say a Russian tail number
48:52 or North Korean flag on them there would
48:56 be a national uproar here that that
48:58 could happen that they we could have an
49:00 aircraft that we did not control in our
49:02 air spaces people would have been fired
49:04 there'd be congressional testimony and
49:06 here we have the same situation but
49:08 because there's no no Russian tail
49:10 number or there's no North Korean flag
49:13 on the aircraft it's crickets nobody
49:16 wants to have the conversation and I
49:19 think that's inherently wrong I think
49:20 that's dangerous mindset to have we have
49:23 to be able to have that conversation as
49:25 a nation and then whatever the American
49:27 people decide then I will march out and
49:30 support that decision and and I will
49:33 support it diligently and to the very
49:35 best of my abilities but to ridicule
49:38 people and to not even have a
49:40 conversation in fact suppress
49:42 conversation and stifle it that is not
49:44 in the bed in fact that's more of a
49:46 national security threat in my opinion
49:48 than any phenomena coming into our to
49:50 our airspace Lou I think that is
49:53 beautifully said and I think it shows
49:55 your integrity let me just mention that
49:58 journalist George Knapp interviewed
50:00 Harry Reid where Reid said that there
50:03 are different fractions in Department of
50:05 Defense there were even some religious
50:08 disputes so it was really hard to do
50:11 this work at the time in your program is
50:14 that correct yes and there are and
50:17 there's religious fundamentalism
50:19 unfortunately that that continues to
50:22 suppress a conversation and I respect
50:25 them I do because I believe in their
50:26 hearts day they are doing the right
50:28 thing I think they feel they are
50:29 protecting the American people maybe by
50:33 not having the conversation I disagree
50:36 with them but I can respect their
50:38 position but then there's also people in
50:40 in society you would not believe the
50:43 backlash that exists even people who you
50:46 think would support this what we are
50:49 doing have come out against it and it's
50:51 because this information wasn't released
50:53 on their terms or may be exactly how
50:56 they anticipated the information should
50:57 be released or in some cases maybe
51:00 they've made a cottage industry
51:01 themselves trying to tell people what
51:04 this is really all about
51:06 and now that the cats out of the bag the
51:08 narrative hasn't followed exactly the
51:11 way they thought it would should go and
51:13 so now we are a threat to them as well
51:15 and it's it's amazing it's it is I never
51:19 expected to see so much
51:24 I understand it's an emotional moment
51:27 but hostility it seems that from
51:30 virtually every angle here people are
51:35 just they're not happy with this and and
51:37 I don't expect them to be happy because
51:39 sometimes the truth isn't there to make
51:41 you happy sometimes the truth actually
51:42 hurts and I get that but you know the
51:46 old saying says the truth shall set you
51:48 free I mean I would rather know the
51:50 truth and live my life with my head
51:52 buried in the sand and I think the
51:55 American people have a right to know
51:57 what we're spending their money on what
51:59 we're spending our time on what we're
52:01 spending our effort and and and the
52:03 incredible talent that we have back in
52:05 that building and around the world
52:07 that have helped with this endeavor
52:09 these are you know it's not me it's
52:12 about them these are amazing Americans
52:14 and human beings that have put their
52:16 credibility and their livelihoods on the
52:18 line because they feel strongly that
52:20 what we're seeing here is something that
52:21 needs to need to be elevated and you
52:26 know if not for their sake listen to
52:31 what what they have to say unless let's
52:33 figure it out you know what maybe if it
52:35 winds up being advanced aircraft from
52:38 another country then great super but it
52:41 but at least now we know and let's not
52:43 live our lives burying our heads in the
52:45 sand and ridiculing each other because
52:47 these things are real this is reality
52:50 and what we are seeing is unquestionable
52:53 and undeniable so what we decide to do
52:55 as a nation that's up to the American
52:57 people that's not up to me but I do
53:00 think we need to continue to gather as
53:03 much information as we can so we can
53:04 make an informed decision and that is it
53:07 that is my my position I don't think we
53:10 should live with our lives buried in the
53:11 sand I think you do that and you that
53:14 could have tremendously horrible
53:17 consequences as a nation
53:19 we can't afford to do that and your
53:20 resignation and even the letter for the
53:23 Secretary of Defense showed your message
53:26 right you want this to be better
53:28 resolved with better focus resources so
53:32 we could finally know once for all right
53:34 yes sir and I think it's another
53:36 important note I never provided my
53:38 resignation letter to anyone outside
53:40 that the the to the media it was always
53:43 to the department I it was it was a copy
53:46 of a letter that went in to my to my
53:49 leadership and what I've been told is
53:52 somebody either current or former DoD
53:56 provided a copy of my letter to the
53:58 media it was never me so the media came
54:01 to me and and the New York Times said
54:03 they were going to write a story one way
54:05 or the other about my resignation letter
54:09 so at that point I realized I had a
54:11 choice I could either give them my
54:13 perspective or they were going to write
54:14 my perspective for me but that letter
54:17 was intended to secretary mattis I think
54:21 he deserved to know the truth
54:22 my my my familiarity with him secretary
54:27 mattis has always been a man who wants
54:28 more information not less and if anybody
54:32 could break down those silos and
54:33 stovepipes he was a man who could do it
54:35 believe me I've seen that man in combat
54:37 if there is one man who can change the
54:39 system for the good it is him and you
54:43 know that's what happened and from my
54:45 understanding there were folks even
54:47 within the department that didn't even
54:48 want to share my resignation letter with
54:51 with the secretary which is again
54:53 indicative of the problem I have another
54:56 sensitive question I know that in Leslie
54:59 Cain's book there were arguments pro and
55:02 Contra is there may be a deeper
55:04 secretive program about this phenomena
55:08 that has a long continuation and maybe
55:10 they even have experts it artifacts and
55:14 so on there are arguments for it and
55:17 against it for example Colonel John
55:19 Alexander tells the story in his book
55:21 about advanced theoretical physics group
55:25 that existed around ten years before
55:28 your program and they tried to establish
55:30 is there a black
55:32 of that type but they were unable to
55:34 confirm it so Duke have any views on
55:37 these possibilities if you can say
55:40 limits of course well of course if
55:44 there's a classified program that I am
55:46 aware of I would not be able to discuss
55:48 it in any way but from general
55:51 perspective as I said there's a lot of
55:53 things that go on the department that
55:55 not necessarily everybody else is aware
55:58 of I would not be surprised if there
56:00 were other pockets in the US government
56:02 that we're doing what we were doing in
56:04 fact I would hope that would be the case
56:06 but I cannot comment either way whether
56:09 or not that is that is that is the case
56:13 I can tell you that I don't think I
56:16 think the approach would be different
56:18 our approach was very specific to what
56:20 we were trying to achieve and
56:24 unfortunately unfortunately no that's
56:27 about all I can say about that
56:28 absolutely completely understandable and
56:31 now you're a part of Tom DeLonge steam
56:34 to the stars
56:35 where you will apply further what you
56:38 learned and what you gathered during
56:40 your program in the Pentagon so maybe
56:43 you can talk a little bit about the
56:45 future plans of yours projects both to
56:48 the stars means to you
56:49 absolutely so to the Stars Academy
56:52 represents an area so let me let me
56:54 first say why I left the department
56:57 there are a few times in life you in
57:00 order to make an organization better you
57:02 actually have to leave it in this
57:03 particular case I did not ask for this
57:05 job that I was given I was asked to take
57:08 it so I took it as many other jobs I've
57:11 had in the past I was given a mission
57:14 that mission was to run a tip and figure
57:18 out what these things were and how they
57:19 works and unfortunately in order to
57:22 accomplish the very mission I was given
57:24 by the Department of Defense I actually
57:26 had to leave the department to do it it
57:28 was in fact my loyalty to the secretary
57:30 why I left that that not because of
57:34 disloyalty my loyalty to the American
57:37 people the Department of Defense and to
57:39 the secretary unwavering but I also
57:42 understood that in order for
57:45 the department and the American people
57:47 to take this to the next level I would
57:50 have to take I would have to take the
57:52 step of leaving the one department that
57:54 I love so much
57:56 and-and-and going to the private side to
57:59 finish the mission I think to the stars
58:02 is is an organization that can help us
58:05 achieve that if you look for just one
58:07 moment and who's who's there
58:09 you're talking about the Giants of the
58:12 aerospace industry and and and
58:14 theoretical physicists and in some cases
58:17 entertainers and and this is going to be
58:20 a collective effort in order for us to
58:22 take our observations and and and very
58:26 hopefully one day soon build the very
58:28 things that we're seeing and yes I know
58:30 to some people they kind of scratch our
58:32 head anything build
58:33 yes build because in the end what we're
58:36 seeing is is it's not voodoo science it
58:40 is actually it's advanced physics but
58:42 it's physics nonetheless and it's
58:44 physics that I think where we are closer
58:46 to understanding now that we ever had
58:47 before and so our hope is to get with
58:51 the best and brightest and actually
58:53 build a working prototype of exactly
58:55 what we're seeing and use that to the
58:58 benefit of mankind I think people look
59:01 at this to the Stars they say oh it's a
59:03 it's a money-making machine no it's not
59:06 it's a money raising machine in order to
59:08 do this right you need money to build
59:10 these things I think tom was was was
59:14 brilliant to set up an organization this
59:16 is a B corporation that's that's stated
59:19 to the public benefits if you know
59:22 anything about B corporations are very
59:23 rare and and they're very labor
59:25 intensive I mean it's really a lot of
59:27 work most folks don't want to do a B
59:30 corporation because there's a lot of
59:31 commitments and requirements to the
59:33 public use and public good and not only
59:36 that Tom did a decided with the with the
59:40 other folks in organization they were
59:42 going to make this a company really for
59:45 the people by the people and so by
59:47 offering a opportunity for the public to
59:50 invest the public can now own the very
59:53 thing we're trying to build and I think
59:55 that's that's very rare any time you do
59:58 so
59:59 like an IPO most people know very few
60:01 people have an opportunity to really buy
60:03 into something like that when you do a
60:05 dpo anybody with a hundred bucks or so
60:09 can can now be part owner of an
60:11 aerospace company so I thought it was
60:14 very bold and very brave and innovative
60:16 for for for Tom and others to to decide
60:19 to go this way Hal and Jim they are they
60:21 all they all agree this was a way to go
60:24 and and I agree this is again where the
60:27 media has gotten it wrong they think
60:29 this is some sort of money-making
60:30 endeavor and it's not it's a money
60:33 raising endeavor and it's to raise the
60:35 money jointly so we can actually build
60:37 these things for the betterment of
60:39 everybody so you know I think I think
60:43 that's that's an important detail that
60:45 gets lost with a lot of people I believe
60:48 me I'm not I would be doing much better
60:50 right now if I was working for the
60:52 government between all my benefits and
60:54 my retirement
60:55 this was not an economically sound
60:57 decision for me to join to the Stars
60:59 Academy so that leaves the other other
61:02 factor of why did it I did it because I
61:04 believe it was the right thing to do I
61:05 believe if any organization has the
61:08 ability now to actually build even even
61:12 a prototype at a small level of scalable
61:14 level this could revolutionize virtually
61:18 everything that we do as a species this
61:20 may be a paradigm shift for us and then
61:23 if other big companies want to come in
61:24 and and and you know take it to the next
61:26 level like I think that's great too but
61:29 Tom had a right and I think there's a
61:32 lot of criticism out there about Tom of
61:35 what may be his intentions are or were
61:38 what his thoughts are what his thoughts
61:40 were but in the end
61:41 Tom achieved something very few people
61:43 have he had he got the government at
61:46 very high levels to acknowledge the fact
61:48 that these things are real and that is a
61:51 game changer and I think we owe a lot to
61:53 Tom for that I think Tom I think people
61:56 confuse Tom as you know being a former
61:59 rock star and an artist well that is
62:02 true but I will tell you he's also a
62:05 pioneer I think he's a visionary and and
62:07 I think as Tom and and us collectively
62:10 we continue to move forward
62:12 think our observations and our and our
62:16 thoughts will continue to mature over
62:18 time there's a lot we still don't know
62:22 or understand now there's a lot we do
62:24 that bright side is we've come a long
62:26 way in the last year and a half in our
62:27 understanding but we still have a long
62:29 way to go and I think as time goes on
62:32 any any human being who's involved in
62:34 something like this will tell you our
62:35 opinions change over time and that's a
62:38 good thing that's not a bad thing that's
62:40 that's about that's a journey of
62:41 personal growth that's that's a journey
62:44 of honesty you know you you don't know
62:47 what you don't know until you know it
62:49 and in this particular case there's a
62:51 lot of unknowns so we are collectively
62:53 exploring this together and hopefully
62:55 with the help of well with anybody and
62:57 everybody who wants to take this journey
62:59 with us I am very optimistic for the
63:04 future I think I think we have a great
63:07 opportunity here to do something that
63:11 will impact people in a very positive
63:16 way now I also understand from personal
63:18 experience history does not treat kindly
63:21 those who try to rush it and believe me
63:23 I I have I have accepted many many
63:26 arrows and many many many much grief
63:28 over this and it's not comfortable if
63:32 anybody wants to be in my shoes I would
63:34 tell you right now run the other way
63:36 this is this is certainly not a way to
63:39 to make yourself rich or to make
63:42 yourself popular in fact it's probably
63:44 going to bankrupt me and make me make me
63:46 the most hated man on the planet but I
63:48 believe in what I'm doing and I have to
63:52 look in the mirror and I have to look at
63:53 my daughters in the face every day and
63:55 and tell them that I'm what I'm doing is
63:58 because I believe it's the right thing
64:00 well some of them maybe will hate you
64:03 but I can tell you one thing now after
64:05 this interview you definitely have a fan
64:08 in me at least something I appreciate
64:13 that very very much and if you will not
64:15 try you will never know so I definitely
64:17 think you have to proceed with your
64:19 dream and your pets you have the
64:21 experience background and data it will
64:25 be a
64:25 and the interesting to see I think Lou
64:29 thank you so much for this conversation
64:31 that's we had it was my sincere honor
64:34 and pleasures for you two to spend some
64:37 of your time with me and you've been so
64:39 gracious with it and I hope I hope I
64:41 didn't bore you too much or cause you to
64:45 lose any any fan base do that but
64:48 certainly not my intention
64:49 absolutely not thank you so much Lou
64:51 once again Chiana thank you again so
64:53 very much and have a wonderful have a
64:55 wonderful evening
64:56 you too take care Lou yes sir

00:00 while I've been waiting for this for a
00:01 long time dr. help would of welcome
00:03 welcome to coast-to-coast
00:05 George it's a pleasure to be here you
00:09 know I read off just a little synopsis
00:11 of your background you are you know you
00:13 have such solid scientific credentials
00:15 you're considered a brilliant guy by
00:18 colleagues all over the world you
00:19 published all these papers I think
00:21 you've been nominated for a Nobel Prize
00:23 at least twice and yet you you sort of
00:25 risk it all in the pursuit of what some
00:28 would call fringe topics crazy subjects
00:30 give me some kind of an idea about how
00:33 you got to this point that you would be
00:36 associated with folks chasing UFOs well
00:40 it certainly was kind of a squirrely
00:44 path to get from there to here but
00:47 anyway as part of my work at Stanford I
00:52 worked on lasers and quantum electronics
00:56 and so on even co-authored a textbook
01:00 that was published in English Russian
01:03 French and Chinese so I here I had
01:06 launched my really terrific career in
01:09 lasers and quantum electronics but it
01:11 turned out that as part of my graduate
01:14 school I had a stint as a naval security
01:17 as a naval intelligence officer with the
01:20 National Security Agency and so it turns
01:24 out that plays a key key key role later
01:27 and so eventually when I left Stanford
01:30 University and with the SRR
01:31 international to do laser research and
01:37 so on it turned out that just on a lock
01:40 I ended up doing a little ESP or PK
01:44 experiment with England Swan is a very
01:46 talented kind of guy and I distribute
01:51 that around and pretty soon the CIA
01:53 landed on my doorstep and turned out
01:56 that they were concerned that the
01:58 Russians were putting millions of
02:00 dollars for over a decade into the area
02:03 of ESP research the scientists in
02:06 America even thought there was such a
02:08 thing and they looked into my background
02:11 so I had all these two
02:13 clearances at NSA I was at SR I that had
02:17 lots of black programs anyway and I was
02:20 a hard scientist physicist and that's
02:22 what they thought they needed would I
02:24 mind taking a look to see if there's
02:26 anything to this stuff
02:27 and actually the truth of matter is they
02:30 were hoping that I would basically find
02:31 out it's all nonsense so they didn't
02:33 have to worry about it make sure close
02:35 the books well as your listeners would
02:39 know that eventually turned into a
02:41 twenty year twenty million dollar
02:43 project program known popularly toured
02:48 the endless projects could Stargate and
02:50 so it was in that process of doing those
02:55 experiments that I began to realize
02:58 there's a lot more to our scientific or
03:02 worldview than we usually usually give
03:04 it credit for and I have to admit that
03:06 even throughout that program every time
03:09 I would go in to do an experiment of the
03:11 remote viewing type as we called it I
03:13 would ask myself what am I doing here
03:15 I'm a physicist
03:17 this can't possibly work and then we get
03:19 another terrific result so based on that
03:24 I just got gleamed I guess you'd say by
03:28 by by the situation and so even when I
03:31 left the SSRI to take up being president
03:36 CEO of Earth Tech International this
03:39 academic arm is to transplant at Austin
03:42 I was basically greens to these kinds of
03:46 things and so when John Alexander for
03:49 example came along and asked me to join
03:50 us you have a working group I did do
03:53 that and through the connection with
03:55 John I ended up being on the Science
03:57 Advisory Board of Robert Bigelow's knids
04:02 National Institute for discovery science
04:04 that you covered pretty thoroughly in
04:06 the first hour and so of course as part
04:10 of that I saw many things and the truth
04:15 matter is most of them we never did get
04:18 to a point that we could explain and so
04:21 it was along this period
04:24 that as it turns out people at DIA
04:27 analyst dia decided that they wanted to
04:31 investigate the kind of stuff that was
04:34 happening in the ranch but primarily
04:36 really the the UFO aspect and so they
04:41 approached that Senator Reid and he
04:46 thought it was a good idea and collected
04:48 his other two senator colleagues
04:51 Stephens from Alaska and Dan anyway from
04:57 Hawaii and they're there they're all
05:01 part of the special access program black
05:04 money kinds of research and so I was
05:09 asked because I was already known to Bob
05:12 Bigelow if I would help respond to the
05:17 request now a lot of a lot of people say
05:20 okay well this is just some kind of
05:21 sweetheart deal between read and Bigelow
05:24 of both things from Nevadans and so on
05:26 truth matter is there was a broad area
05:30 announcement out of DIA any Aerospace
05:33 Corporation could apply for the bid for
05:36 the grant but it turned out that Bigelow
05:39 got it and so that's how I suddenly
05:42 ended up being immersed in what we now
05:46 call the HF program they have 22 million
05:50 dollars over the period of time some
05:52 people say it went from 2007 to 2012 05:55 some say it's 2008 to 2011 still in
05:59 Pentagon terms it's not a lot of money
06:01 is it it's not a lot of money and
06:05 usually programs that do require a lot
06:08 of money are programs that have a lot of
06:11 build-out of equipment or a lot of
06:14 personnel and so on basically this is an
06:16 analytical group to evaluate data to
06:20 collect data and evaluate it so is
06:23 primarily a personnel cost that went
06:27 into it although it's also true that
06:30 Bigelow was asked to put some special
06:34 buildings together with high security
06:37 to begin to store materials that would
06:40 be coming along as part of the program
06:41 so but it's it's not it's not a lot of
06:44 money I have to admit you have so you
06:47 work for the NSA for a while your
06:49 consultant to CIA you're with Bob
06:51 Bigelow and knids and they always
06:53 whenever I read Bob Bigelow's name and
06:55 some UFO publication they had touched
06:56 the word shadowy to it the shadowy Bob
06:59 Bigelow then you write an RFP that goes
07:01 to the DIA and then back in October
07:03 you're standing on a stage with Tom
07:05 DeLonge and other principles of to the
07:07 stars Tom of course has taken a lot of
07:09 heat and lumps and I'm just wondering
07:12 that makes you part of the Cabal doesn't
07:14 it it don't sound like I'm part of the
07:16 cabal doesn't it and certainly I can
07:20 actually understand how it is that your
07:24 average onlooker out there in the UFO
07:26 field would come to that conclusion
07:27 because after all they see suddenly this
07:31 collaboration emerging for a new startup
07:34 the to the stars Academy of Arts and
07:38 Science and involves Louella zonda who
07:40 just left as being the program director
07:43 of the a tip program and Pentagon and
07:46 then you've got chris mellon former
07:49 deputy assistant secretary of defense
07:50 for intelligence jim simav an who's a
07:53 high-level fellow out of the d do you
07:59 got steve justice long time program
08:03 director at the skunk works and myself
08:05 with decades involvement CIA a dia and
08:09 as a contract and so on and so i can
08:12 imagine that people look at that set up
08:15 and say okay this has got to be some
08:17 kind of massive conspiracy this must
08:21 been in the plans for forever and it's
08:26 trying to pull the American public along
08:29 and some direction concerning belief and
08:32 so on to the matter is the people on
08:37 this list
08:40 all have had high access of course and
08:43 the point is that having that high
08:45 access put us in a position one by one
08:49 to recognize that the subject area was
08:52 not being handled as effectively and
08:54 efficiently as it could that it's all
08:57 locked up in various kinds of stovepipe
09:01 situations I mean just to give you a
09:04 perfect example these videos that have
09:07 come out where everyone is looking at
09:09 them and analyzing them and so on I mean
09:12 those videos were there in the Pentagon
09:13 and what could they do to get additional
09:16 help to evaluate them
09:20 it really wasn't wasn't a way to do that
09:22 and so the idea that we would come
09:25 together and form a public benefit
09:28 corporation as we call it in order to
09:31 begin to get this put some sunshine on
09:35 this area and get it out to where it's
09:38 no longer subject to ridicule hopefully
09:40 but rather something that people can
09:44 take part in and see results being made
09:47 and so it's a Cabala in the best sense I
09:52 would say and that is we're taking the
09:56 knowledge and information and results we
09:58 know and to the degree that any of it
10:01 can be made public because it's not
10:04 classified and further work that can be
10:06 done that's not classified this can
10:09 become part of the societal public
10:13 discussion so it's just the opposite
10:16 really of the people who would say you
10:19 know there's some giant cabal that they
10:21 worked on poor Lou Elizondo and finally
10:24 pushed him out the door to be a
10:26 lightning rod for all kinds of
10:29 conspiracy theories now it was just the
10:32 opposite these are all hard-working
10:34 people all people who one way or another
10:37 ran across this subject area and knew
10:39 there was a lot to it actually and has
10:42 been over the years and there's been
10:44 difficulty in figuring out how how to do
10:47 with it why is that well in this subject
10:51 area even inside the government
10:54 what do you have to deal with you've got
10:56 fear you've got career ISM you got
11:00 incompetence
11:02 you've even got fundamental religious
11:06 views saying this is not an area that
11:09 American taxpayer of money should be
11:10 should be spent on the set of comments
11:15 came from comb Kelleher who was Bob
11:19 Bigelow's basically deputy manager for
11:23 the HF program and he's right those are
11:25 the kind of things would always ran into
11:27 so despite the fact that there was
11:29 funding and work was getting done and
11:32 was getting done professionally
11:35 nonetheless we had to brief other groups
11:39 we had to try to set up programs in
11:42 other areas and we ran into all kinds of
11:45 problems so I think this giant step that
11:49 we took to come out from behind the
11:54 curtain so to speak and set up something
11:56 that public can have access to and
11:59 participate in that was really a step in
12:03 the right direction you know I don't
12:05 have a security clearance so I'm just
12:06 basing this on what I've picked up over
12:09 the years but my sense of it is the
12:11 military would have these encounters
12:13 with unknown aerial objects from some
12:16 place else that could perform these
12:18 incredible maneuvers a report is made it
12:21 goes somewhere it gets stuck in a drawer
12:24 that there's no central body that
12:26 analyzes this stuff it does no one any
12:28 good to make too much of a big fuss over
12:30 it so for example like with the USS
12:33 Nimitz incident that happened in 2004 12:35 those videos were recorded they went
12:37 somewhere and no one did anything with
12:39 it until bass and a tip and you guys
12:42 came along that's exactly that's exactly
12:45 the case and one of the nice things that
12:48 we've arranged to do on the to the Stars
12:52 website we have a link to something
12:56 called COI community of interest and
13:00 tapping on that link you can get to the
13:03 videos as you've already seen them and
13:06 saving you
13:06 times or whatever but in addition we
13:09 have all the documentation it was
13:12 arranged in advance before those videos
13:14 left Pentagon that they went through
13:18 massive review typical of releasing
13:22 previously classified information and
13:26 all the chain of custody taking place as
13:32 the videos were transferred out all that
13:36 information is there so it's possible to
13:38 get a complete rundown so rather than
13:41 just being a video that what the heck
13:43 you know it might have just shown up on
13:45 the internet someplace in this case you
13:46 have a complete chain of custody and a
13:48 lot of detail you know describing even
13:52 the Raytheon clear systems for the
13:57 looking infrared radar systems used to
13:59 gather the data and so I think that's
14:04 that's that's a step in the right
14:05 direction
14:06 so is this an initial release I mean
14:08 someone had the green light that yes it
14:11 could be released that's right I mean it
14:13 was released out of the elements that
14:18 Lisa was on da was in charge of and he
14:22 was the authority there for how to deal
14:26 with that information and of course as
14:28 part of the long ranging agent program
14:31 he archived all this material and so on
14:34 but but there it was I mean there was
14:37 some analysis going on in house I mean
14:39 in addition to the DoD in the Pentagon
14:43 had Navy and CIA people were involved in
14:48 analyses but nonetheless not as much as
14:52 what really needs to be done and so that
14:55 was the idea in setting up this start up
14:59 to the Stars Academy of Arts and Science
15:01 to set up a situation and assuming we
15:05 can get the funding to be able to carry
15:09 out these kind of analyses in in great
15:11 detail let's talk about we'll go to a
15:14 break in about three minutes I think
15:16 that might be enough time to talk about
15:17 the tick-tock video the USS Nimitz
15:20 video what can you tell us about that
15:22 you know we've seen amateur experts
15:25 online saying it's a bug on it's a bug
15:28 on a windshield or it's a lens flare or
15:30 it's the sound of a vacuum cleaner or a
15:32 lawn mower what can you tell us about
15:35 why you were impressed by that video
15:39 well primarily because it isn't just the
15:43 video I mean that's what most people
15:45 have had access to and are attempting to
15:48 analyze and come up with alternatives
15:51 like well it's just a jet in the
15:52 distance because that also makes
15:54 infrared spots that can be detected and
16:00 so on but the full data on the Nimitz
16:04 involves radar tracking these this
16:09 object coming in from 60,000 feet
16:12 dropping down to 50 feet in a matter of
16:14 seconds there the radar records of that
16:17 and then you've got the pilots a de
16:21 flavor has given interviews on this you
16:24 can find it all over the internet and
16:26 also on the to the Stars Academy website
16:31 where he actually got into you which you
16:35 might almost call a dogfight with it and
16:37 that is he circled around it and it
16:39 circled around him and they got very
16:41 close I mean it was nose to nose and so
16:44 in that situation you could tell exactly
16:48 the size of it about forty six feet
16:51 across and so he could see the
16:57 acceleration that it could could
16:59 accomplish I mean in that very incident
17:02 for example although they were supposed
17:05 to be doing an exercise at some point
17:08 they had been reroute 'add to check this
17:11 thing out and then after the thing took
17:14 off the radar operator said well this
17:18 thing whatever it is has gone to the
17:20 place where you're supposed to have your
17:22 training thing well I mean it was miles
17:24 and miles away and it got there in a few
17:27 seconds and no sonic boom I mean so
17:30 there's so much data well beyond just
17:33 tapes all integrated together and that's
17:36 what makes this kind of observation
17:38 absolutely spectacular kind of thing
17:41 well there's also the gimbal video which
17:44 we're gonna ask you to analyze and then
17:46 there are promises of other videos and I
17:49 want to know if you've seen those as
17:50 well we were talking with dr. Hal put
17:52 off about the tic-tac video the gimbal
17:55 video ufos studies by bass and the
17:59 pentagon and a much more to come here on
18:01 coast to coast am dr. hal put off from
18:04 the Institute for Advanced Studies in
18:06 Austin we're talking about the
18:07 Pentagon's UFOs study conducted through
18:11 the auspices of a private company bass
18:14 founded by Robert Bigelow and as you've
18:17 if you've been listening you know we're
18:19 talking about the tic-tac video big
18:21 question is how does this work did we
18:23 figure out how these this these objects
18:26 can make these kind of leaps and fly
18:28 circles around our most advanced weapon
18:31 systems and platforms and what about
18:33 that gimbal video that was also released
18:35 by the Pentagon and will we eventually
18:38 see other videos that have been released
18:40 much more to come here on coast to coast
18:42 am i'll put off we all saw the tic tac
18:46 video the USS nimitz battle group how do
18:50 we know it's not the Russians or the
18:51 Chinese or us some other classified
18:54 program that not everyone has been told
18:56 about well we don't absolutely rule that
19:00 out the basically the twofold nature of
19:08 the threat as far as a tip program goes
19:11 is specified very specifically one is is
19:16 there a current threat from this
19:19 phenomena could be a foreign derivation
19:22 could be offworld
19:24 nonetheless it's obviously being
19:26 deployed and tested including in our
19:29 country and then there's the future
19:31 threat which is really concerning and
19:34 that is potential terrestrial
19:36 adversaries achieving significant
19:39 breakthroughs and development of
19:40 game-changing disruptive technologies
19:42 based on a valuation of the UAP
19:46 phenomena
19:47 from sensor data or crash retrieved
19:49 materials so our best analysts and based
19:56 on the intelligence information we have
19:57 so far we've not been able to track it
20:00 back to Russian or Chinese I mean is
20:06 there some other terrestrial society off
20:09 the grid I mean everything is on the
20:12 table because we're strictly only going
20:16 to pay attention to what we can observe
20:18 and what we can prove and so basically
20:23 looking at the characteristics and
20:25 matching them up against what we know of
20:28 our special systems and other foreign
20:32 adversary systems it just doesn't seem
20:35 to match anything that we know about now
20:39 that's not to say that we can't make
20:41 progress in trying to figure out how
20:42 this works
20:43 in fact the large part of my own
20:45 activity in this program was to go
20:49 through the physics as Eric described I
20:53 commissioned 38 papers to give us the
20:56 best physics in all kinds of new areas
20:58 like metallic glasses or plasma
21:02 propulsion or whatever and there was a
21:07 model that came to the floor that I
21:09 explored in some detail which I think
21:11 has some merit and that is what we call
21:15 space time metric engineering and that
21:17 is when you look at the effects that are
21:21 associated rapid accelerations the
21:25 changes of direction instantly the
21:29 ability to hover all these things as
21:33 wild as they are the truth of matter is
21:36 if you take general relativity equations
21:40 writing down one side of a piece of
21:41 paper and then you write down all of the
21:45 oddball observations on the other side
21:47 of the piece of paper you can get a
21:49 reasonable match between them so that
21:53 sounds good
21:54 the problem is though what it would take
21:57 in the general relativistic physics we
21:59 at the present time is we just don't
22:02 have the energy densities that can
22:04 possibly create those effects so that
22:08 makes me from a physicist standpoint
22:10 extremely skeptical that this is
22:13 something that we have in the back room
22:15 or the Russians or the Chinese hair you
22:18 know the word threat in the a tip title
22:21 has a lot of people upset these are our
22:24 friendly space brothers there are no
22:26 threat to us they haven't attacked us
22:28 they haven't wiped out cities the threat
22:30 though that you see though is that the
22:32 Russians and Chinese could be studying
22:34 this and figure this out and get this
22:35 technology at us when I talked to
22:38 Senator Reid like late last year he had
22:41 said that he thought and I'm not sure
22:43 what his sources are that he thought the
22:44 Russians and Chinese were studying this
22:46 stuff and now we're studying up for a
22:49 while and in stop you know there's
22:50 absolutely no doubt that they're
22:52 studying them I've read detailed
22:55 classified documents on the Russian work
22:59 the military equivalents around the
23:04 world are all concerned about this for
23:07 the very same reasons the Russians would
23:09 be worried that we could reverse
23:11 engineer if we get some technology under
23:15 our fingertips so so that's that's
23:17 definitely a major issue so there's
23:24 there's no there's no getting around it
23:25 this is this is taken seriously it has
23:28 to be considered a threat now are there
23:31 any indications well it was true that we
23:33 haven't had any obvious hostile attack
23:39 on the other hand it's also the case as
23:44 Harry mentioned in an interview with you
23:47 that these crafts have infiltrated our
23:54 missile silos on nuclear missile silos
23:56 and have an occasion taking them offline
24:01 once or twice could be some kind of
24:04 coincidence but there's a whole northern
24:07 tier where
24:08 this happened at base after base after
24:10 base and it turns out the same thing has
24:12 happened in Russia as well and so you
24:15 have two ways of interpreting it one is
24:17 that they're just checking out that they
24:21 know how to stop it if we get too frisky
24:23 here and therefore that'd be a nice
24:25 benign interpretation on the other hand
24:29 if there's some thought that eventually
24:31 there will be some hostile interaction
24:36 between us and they might be wanting to
24:37 check that they can be sure to take out
24:39 our nuclear missile silo so so from the
24:44 standpoint of Pentagon whereas all the
24:48 other people out there some kinds of
24:50 speculates that it might be this might
24:51 be that and they hope this and I hope
24:53 it's math in the Pentagon and in the
24:57 intelligence communities you can only
24:59 work to determine what actually is the
25:02 facts and in the absence of data to the
25:06 contrary or proof to the contrary you
25:08 have to assume that there could be a
25:11 threat aspect whether from the phenomena
25:13 itself or as we've already discussed
25:15 from a potential adversary making
25:20 game-changing disruptive technology
25:22 based on their evaluations I had heard
25:24 and I'm not sure if it's public or if
25:26 it's true but I had heard that there
25:28 were multiple incidents and encounters
25:30 with tic-tac type technology that the
25:33 increasing frequency is sort of one of
25:36 the things that convinced Louie's
25:37 Elizondo to leave the Pentagon to go
25:39 join to the Stars Academy and to work on
25:41 this this problem that's exactly alright
25:46 though you hear that the program may
25:50 have shut down in 2012 or whatever the
25:54 truth of matter is tic-tac incidents off
25:57 the east coast the United States that
25:59 interfered with our our air flight plans
26:06 and activities I mean it's it's it's
26:11 it's absolutely an unbelievable rush of
26:16 that kind of slamming happening and so
26:19 even in the gimbal video
26:22 even though in the video you only
26:23 see a given craft when you dig down into
26:28 the details that you can do if you go to
26:30 the community of interest link on the to
26:34 the stars Academy of Arts and Science it
26:38 turns out that in the verbal transcripts
26:43 that are presented they see on their
26:46 larger radar sites while they get a nice
26:49 red picture of the gimbal that they're
26:51 watching that there's a whole fleet of
26:54 them I mean quite a number of them all
26:57 flying around so it's not just kind of
27:00 one-off phenomena and it seems to be
27:05 happening as massively these days as
27:09 ever the gimbal video is not the same as
27:13 the tic-tac 2004 incident it shows a
27:16 project that seems to have a field
27:18 around it you know what that field is
27:21 don't know basically on the FLIR what
27:25 you're seeing is basically the
27:26 temperature distribution and so it could
27:30 simply be that it's a heat or it's cold
27:35 compared to the heat of the object so we
27:40 don't have any idea but basically what
27:42 that FLIR device picks up is basically
27:46 the temperature distribution so we know
27:49 it has something to do with the
27:50 temperature but beyond that there's no
27:55 way to interpret it as say some kind of
27:56 electromagnetic or or whatever Tom
28:00 DeLonge and Lewis Elizondo have made
28:02 public statements about other videos as
28:04 many as two dozen that have already come
28:08 out of the Pentagon have you seen them
28:09 and do you know what the plans are for
28:11 their eventual release I've seen one
28:15 additional one that we're planning on
28:18 getting out relatively soon it's sort of
28:24 need an interesting video you see
28:27 watching this thing and zeroed in just
28:30 like in these other two videos then some
28:32 point it just takes off like a shot I
28:34 mean
28:35 it's sort of unreal if you talk to the
28:39 pilots about it and there are other
28:43 videos that I'm told but I haven't
28:47 looked at any so what is the eventual
28:53 plan and the study is done the bass part
28:57 of the study is done people are still
28:59 collecting information according to you
29:00 and Eric Davis is there some more formal
29:03 program underway as it's some of this
29:05 going to be funneled to to the stars to
29:07 analyze and evaluate and figure out the
29:14 program in the Pentagon is certainly
29:16 continuing
29:19 I think there's a fair chance that it
29:22 will continue an accelerated pace and to
29:26 the degree that this sort of community
29:28 of interest thing can be set up to work
29:32 we anticipate seeing cooperation and
29:35 collaboration with possibly mcgann
29:39 directly or with other aerospace
29:41 corporations who get involved that we
29:45 would be subcontractors to so there's a
29:49 lot going on behind the scenes to set up
29:51 new funding organizations and so on
29:54 people have complained or why as to the
29:57 stars sort of not going anywhere very
30:00 fast well the truth of matter is for
30:02 what we want to do it needs funding and
30:05 so raising the money the sort of bad
30:11 funding approaches works to a certain
30:14 degree but to really to get a robust
30:17 technical organization going because the
30:21 reason I joined and the reason Steve
30:23 justice joined from the skunkworks
30:25 is that we don't want to see this just
30:28 as they start kind of thing getting
30:31 information out to the public although
30:32 that's a major piece of it we also want
30:36 to see and get started
30:38 various technical projects and programs
30:40 that take advantage of some of the
30:43 information that that's been learned a
30:45 lot of the data within the bass program
30:48 is it's archived in tremendous amount of
30:54 materials you can possibly believe Bob
30:58 Bigelow had something like 46 people
31:00 working there putting all this stuff
31:03 together I mean just to give you one
31:05 example we looked at Clara's Island
31:08 Brazil case 1977-1978 hundreds of UAVs
31:15 observed by civilians in the brazil
31:18 brazilian air force investigative team
31:20 called operation plate they got more
31:23 than a thousand pages of documents log
31:25 sketches and maps more than 500 31:28 photographs greater than 15 hours of
31:31 motion film measured a lot of
31:33 physiological effects and medical
31:36 injuries and so put together a whole
31:39 database at all of that eventually a lot
31:43 of that material this is part of the
31:46 copis to the stars moves forward is that
31:51 we will be able to arrange on a
31:54 case-by-case basis study by study basis
31:57 to possibly release this material its
32:01 present time it's a big little
32:04 proprietary as it should be and so there
32:07 will be negotiation over attempting to
32:11 put some of that data out so that well a
32:14 lot of people have filed requests
32:15 through FOIA I'm one of them I yeah you
32:19 know you mentioned the scenario where
32:21 maybe the Russians are Chinese learn
32:23 something based on a crash one of the
32:26 most intriguing sentences in the New
32:27 York Times report mentioned an exotic
32:29 material of unknown origin that was at
32:33 Bigelow Aerospace for a while is that
32:36 from a crash do you think crashes have
32:38 happened or can you say detailed proof
32:51 the crashes that happened would be still
32:53 highly classified piece of data well
33:01 that's an answer of sorts yeah there
33:03 have been there there has been one
33:06 leaked document how it got leaked oh
33:09 I'll never know which is out there that
33:11 talks about some crashes that we were
33:15 able to verify what was was a real
33:18 document so my opinion is that there
33:22 probably is the Ark probably at least
33:26 materials now would necessarily have to
33:29 be crash of an entire craft but it could
33:31 be you know a piece blown off and
33:34 whatever by a lightning strike or a
33:37 missile or whatever so so I'm not
33:40 surprised to find out that there's
33:43 discussion of material being available
33:49 we've had an opportunity to look at some
33:52 unusual material and so I think that's a
33:57 that's a big area that will become more
34:01 significant as time goes on I like
34:04 you're killing me how you had a chance
34:06 to look at some material I did and the
34:13 interesting thing about it was that I
34:15 couldn't figure out a very complex
34:18 material when you talk to people that
34:21 are doing this kind of research you find
34:23 out you know it isn't that you know all
34:26 the elements the periodic table we know
34:28 about so you're not finding some new
34:30 element that you didn't realize was in
34:32 the periodic table no it's more like
34:35 putting together layered layers of
34:43 various kinds of material that you would
34:44 expect to be able to be layered and that
34:47 the result at the end of the day is that
34:51 it has certain unusual characteristics
34:53 that you wouldn't have predicted in
34:55 advance so that's not the kind of thing
35:01 that to finish this is the most
35:05 you know the first time I met you we
35:08 were on a flight to go meet Philip Corso
35:10 it was before his book came out before
35:13 the world heard from him and he was
35:14 talking about something he had learned
35:16 at the Pentagon about how alien
35:18 technology was was engineered Adams at a
35:22 time I don't know if it's this material
35:25 you're talking about fits with that but
35:27 it's amazing that it's come full circle
35:30 sort of yeah that's that's that that's
35:32 the kind of thing so it will probably be
35:38 some time before we really learn a lot
35:42 about materials or even if we figure
35:44 them out how to make them and it can be
35:46 very you know I mean let's face it even
35:49 you know 10 years ago no one would have
35:51 thought of making graphene or whatever I
35:53 mean so our own science is coming up up
35:57 up to speed pretty rapidly and so that
36:03 means that if there are materials
36:05 available then as time goes on with our
36:08 increased acuity in examining materials
36:13 and evaluating them you know we'll
36:15 probably learn more as time goes on if
36:18 more materials become available dr. hal
36:21 put off can't thank you enough for being
36:22 with us I hope you'll come back there's
36:24 so much more to talk about and I
36:26 basically if we've learned one thing
36:28 it's that this deserves to be studied
36:29 and if we don't study it and figure it
36:31 out someone else will right
36:33 that's all right look forward to
36:36 whatever comes next from to the stars
36:39 Academy we'll be watching it thank you
36:41 how appreciate it for being here ok
36:44 thanks George for having me 

==========6uZqdlzb63I==========

00:00 I think it's terrifying I mean this
00:01 seems potentially like one of the
00:03 biggest stories of my lifetime and I
00:05 don't care if it's about UFOs or
00:07 whatever you call it something that we
00:09 don't understand is getting very close
00:11 to our military aircraft and the
00:12 government isn't responding adequately
00:14 and I hope you keep sounding the alarm
00:15 on this UFOs have captivated the public
00:19 interest for decades but they've always
00:20 been dismissed including by me as the
00:23 province of wackos but that is changing
00:26 thanks to some remarkable videotape and
00:28 first-hand accounts from very sober
00:30 people who are trained to identify
00:31 aircraft and that would include this
00:34 video it shows two Navy pilots
00:36 encountering something bizarre off the
00:38 east coast of the United States watch
00:39 this
01:00 okay these are guys who fly for a living
01:03 who know what other airplanes look like
01:05 including those maintained by foreign
01:06 governments and they're totally shocked
01:08 by this this is one among many incidents
01:10 like it including many that have
01:11 happened in the middle of the day to
01:13 sober people lots of independent
01:15 witnesses at the same event in
01:16 commercial pilots military pilots O'Hare
01:19 Airport in the afternoon none of them
01:21 have obvious explanations these are
01:23 aircrafts apparently that are moving in
01:25 ways that appear to violate physics that
01:27 are flying very differently from any
01:28 aircraft ever observed and way faster
01:31 than any plane that we know any foreign
01:33 country has what is this well we don't
01:36 know because for some reason the Defense
01:37 Department is not interested in finding
01:39 out Lu Elizondo is a former Pentagon
01:43 official he helped research UFOs he said
01:46 the DoD is not taking any of this
01:47 seriously for some reason mr. Elizondo
01:50 joins us tonight good to see you thank
01:51 you for having so did I overstate that
01:53 is there a growing corpus of evidence
01:55 not drunk people on a lonely rural road
01:58 at 3:00 in the morning but sober
01:59 military pilots saying something that we
02:02 can't explain is happening that is
02:03 correct you're talking about individuals
02:05 who have very high security clearances
02:07 they are trained observers we've
02:09 actually paid them and put them through
02:10 schools to be trained and very keen
02:13 observers to scrutinize what they're
02:14 seeing these are individuals who we
02:16 trust to fly weapons platform sometimes
02:19 with LiveView munitions over US cities
02:21 and to fight and win wars on our behalf
02:24 and they're reporting to us that they're
02:26 seeing something that they can't explain
02:29 and it's also being backed up by the
02:31 video evidence and the radar data and
02:33 other witnesses but these must just be
02:34 weather balloons right well weather
02:38 balloons that are expressing
02:40 technologies that are far beyond our
02:42 current understanding of aerodynamics
02:45 things that are maneuvering in ways that
02:48 no aircraft that we are currently aware
02:50 of has that capability to flight
02:52 performance characteristics that are
02:54 well beyond the threshold of what we
02:56 would consider I think normal or routine
02:59 for for aircraft so they have no flight
03:01 surfaces no wings or anything
03:03 approaching a wing and there's also no
03:06 obvious propulsion so infrared doesn't
03:08 pick up any jet trail or rocket exhaust
03:11 coming out of these things right
03:12 plume you know there's there's many ways
03:14 to tap propulsion you can do it with a
03:16 jet engine for example or polar or
03:19 rocket engine in this particular case
03:21 you have objects that are doing things
03:23 maneuvering in ways without any obvious
03:25 sign of propulsion and and defying the
03:28 natural effects of Earth's gravitational
03:30 at what speeds well some are very very
03:33 very fast faster than our aircraft and
03:36 absolutely hypersonic speeds and by the
03:39 way without any obvious signs or
03:41 signatures involved so when an object
03:43 moving through the atmosphere you would
03:44 expect it to have certain signatures
03:46 associated with that particular aircraft
03:48 whether it's a missile drone rocket so
03:51 for example you might see a heat
03:52 signature coming from you might see
03:54 ionization of the atmosphere
03:56 you might hear a sonic boom which you
03:58 normally would it's an acoustic
03:59 signature in this particular case these
04:02 objects don't have any of those
04:03 signatures so we know that they're not
04:05 US military because they wouldn't be
04:07 flying near US military aircraft as they
04:10 so often have and it seems like we would
04:13 know if foreign countries had that
04:15 acknowledged look I have no idea what it
04:16 is the bottom line is this is a
04:18 potential threat a grave one to our
04:19 country
04:20 what is DoD doing about it well I can't
04:23 speak on behalf of DoD right now because
04:25 I'm no longer employed as a Department
04:26 of Defense employee but I can speak to
04:29 what they were doing about it and what
04:30 they weren't doing about it when I was
04:31 part of the program
04:33 I think DoD is a very large complex
04:37 organization I think it's very good at
04:39 what it normally does but in this
04:41 particular case we had a very
04:42 ill-defined problem set and so when
04:45 you're going to the boss and you say
04:47 look boss we have we have something here
04:49 we don't know what it is we sure don't
04:52 know how it works and by the way there's
04:54 nothing we can do about it that is a
04:56 very difficult conversation to have in
04:58 an organization that is it's the sole
05:01 mission is national security it's just I
05:03 think it's just I think it's terrifying
05:04 I mean this seems potentially like one
05:06 of the biggest stories of my lifetime
05:08 and I don't care if it's about UFOs or
05:10 whatever you call it something that we
05:12 don't understand is getting very close
05:14 to our military aircraft and the
05:16 government isn't responding adequately
05:17 and I hope you keep sounding the alarm
05:18 on this yeah I think if I may just very
05:20 quickly we got ten seconds okay you go
05:23 to the metro you see a sign see
05:24 something say something and we get we
05:26 get
05:26 Attaway for reporting it in this
05:28 particular case these pilots who are
05:29 seeing something in this backed up by
05:31 other data it's nothing it's terrifying
05:33 that's that's the essence of dysfunction
05:35 lu thank you for that 

==========r2mQsEkQVHQ==========

00:00 i'm going to go along in a rapid clip
00:01 i've got a lot of information here
00:03 so here we go
00:07 the sse is no stranger to the subject of
00:11 ufos unidentified aerial phenomena is
00:14 just a new acronym for ufos
00:17 back a couple of decades ago peter
00:19 sturrock one of our founding members of
00:22 sse arranged with
00:27 rockefeller to hold a
00:31 week-long workshop at the rockefeller
00:36 residence where we brought in the best
00:39 of the ufo researchers
00:41 and then a panel of independent experts
00:44 and had a week-long
00:45 discussion of physical evidence related
00:48 to
00:49 ufo objects of which there's there's a
00:52 significant amount of data and lawrence
00:54 rockefeller
00:56 hosted the whole thing it was it was a
00:58 wonderful meeting
01:00 eventually uh after publishing in the
01:03 sse journal
01:06 peter sturrock put together a book the
01:08 ufo enigma
01:10 and it is still one of the best books
01:11 you can find out there
01:13 to take a look at what are the physical
01:16 aspects
01:17 of ufos that researchers have uncovered
01:23 however of course the government also is
01:25 no stranger to
01:26 the ufo phenomena anyone who follows a
01:29 field would be familiar with
01:31 project sign grudge and blue book
01:34 but in 1969 the content committee
01:37 shut it all down and said really we
01:40 don't need to be
01:41 involved in this area anymore we're
01:43 we're not learning anything we're not
01:45 getting anywhere
01:46 it's not clear that this is a
01:48 significant area
01:50 and so for the average person on the
01:52 street that's when it all kind of ended
01:54 at least serious government interest
01:57 in fact that's not true
02:01 the very memo that shut down blue book
02:04 written by general bolender had
02:08 as part of its language reports of ufos
02:11 which could affect national security
02:13 would continue to be handled through the
02:14 standard air force procedures
02:17 designed for this purpose nonetheless as
02:20 far as the public was concerned
02:22 that was it i mean even the air force
02:25 public affairs office
02:27 put out circulars all the time in
02:29 response to questions saying
02:31 no well we gave this up in 1969.
02:36 what in fact did occur was that there
02:38 were programs going on behind the scenes
02:40 anyway
02:41 as required by the belinder mineral
02:44 now most people didn't know about these
02:46 programs they weren't advertised they
02:47 weren't responded to
02:49 foa requests usually went dry
02:53 but that all changed last december
02:57 when the new york times published a
02:59 front page
03:00 story on how there was this
03:04 program investigating this area
03:07 advanced aerospace threat identification
03:09 program
03:11 it was deeply buried but new york times
03:14 had good sources
03:16 and they came up with information about
03:17 the program and so there's been a lot of
03:20 publicity about it since the
03:24 new york times broke the story
03:26 washington post cnn
03:28 fox news has been picked up all over the
03:30 place
03:32 and one of the reasons why it's
03:34 attracted attention at this point
03:37 are the quality of the sources going
03:39 public
03:40 ex-senate majority leader harry reid is
03:43 the one who
03:44 initiated the program top-rated f-18 03:47 pilots who encountered advanced
03:49 aerospace vehicles at close range
03:52 were permitted to come forward and tell
03:54 their stories
03:56 which up until now they hadn't because
03:57 they didn't want to lose their flight
03:59 status by reporting
04:00 what they had found at least publicly
04:04 and a number of significant department
04:06 of defense and intelligence community
04:07 officials have come forward
04:09 to talk about the reality of this
04:12 phenomena
04:12 and the fact that there were programs
04:14 going on
04:16 the program was nicknamed advanced
04:19 aerospace
04:20 threat identification program atip
04:24 people have trouble trying to get
04:27 documents out of the pentagon
04:28 by saying they want all documents in
04:30 atip and they have a hard time because
04:33 that wasn't actually the name of the
04:34 program that
04:35 top name there is the actual name of the
04:37 program but atip was
04:38 with the nickname that it went by
04:43 it began in june of 2007 04:47 defense intelligence agency was
04:49 concerned about the fact that
04:51 obvious observation had shown that
04:53 advanced aerospace vehicles crafts of
04:56 drones of unknown origin
04:58 were flying all over the united states
05:01 over waters
05:02 in fact globally is the case
05:06 and so a congressional budget was
05:08 approved to address the issue
05:09 behind the scenes center majority
05:13 senate majority leader harry reid from
05:15 nevada was the one who
05:17 was the initiator of the program joined
05:19 by
05:20 senator enuay and senator stevens
05:23 these are the people who generally
05:25 approved programs
05:26 that were in the black under high
05:29 security
05:30 behind the scenes and so they set up
05:33 this program
05:37 senator reid has not uh walked this back
05:40 since all the news came out he's been
05:41 very forthright and given a number of
05:43 interviews
05:44 this particular statement sort of
05:46 captures it all we don't know the
05:48 answers
05:49 but we have plenty of evidence to
05:51 support the questions
05:53 this is about science and national
05:54 security if america doesn't take a lead
05:56 answering these questions
05:58 others will
06:02 well there's a twofold nature of the
06:03 threat
06:05 first of all you've got these advanced
06:06 aerospace vehicles flying around
06:08 that we don't know where they come from
06:11 who's driving them
06:13 what the intent is possibly off world
06:17 even
06:18 but the future threat was actually as
06:20 far as a department defense went
06:22 and the intelligence community one of
06:24 the greater concerns
06:27 what happens if potential adversaries
06:31 achieve significant breakthroughs by
06:33 getting hold of
06:36 advanced technology either based on
06:38 their study of the phenomena
06:40 or from sensor data or crash retrieved
06:42 materials
06:43 then that could provide a problem for
06:45 the united states in the
06:47 sense of threat
06:51 and there's reason to be concerned about
06:52 that this is a document in the program
06:54 we dug up out of the
06:56 soviet union it's a very thick document
06:59 it shows that the soviet union had a
07:01 massive
07:02 program also trying to get to the root
07:04 of
07:05 all of this and in this document a
07:07 number of research institutes and
07:09 military institutes are
07:11 are listed and of course they had the
07:12 same concerns we did
07:14 is there threat from the phenomena
07:18 or might the americans make headway
07:20 before us
07:21 and that be a threat
07:26 just to give you an idea of what's being
07:29 observed which many of people
07:30 seen because it's been in the news a lot
07:33 lately
07:34 back in november of 2004 a nimitz
07:37 carrier group
07:38 was out on patrol off of san diego and
07:44 on several occasions an advanced
07:46 aerospace vehicle
07:47 would descend rapidly from sixty
07:49 thousand feet to fifty feet
07:51 in seconds and then hover and then take
07:54 off like a bullet
08:00 when it first happened and happened over
08:02 a number of weeks actually
08:04 uh 2f18 i'll talk about 2f18 08:08 pilots were vectored onto the site where
08:10 this
08:12 they were being observed by the radars
08:14 to investigate
08:17 and what they saw was what they called a
08:20 tic-tac-craft
08:22 solid white smooth no edges
08:26 about 46 feet in length
08:30 uniformly colored no nacelles pilings
08:32 and wings
08:36 the f-18s could not obtain lock with
08:38 their radars
08:40 because they were stealthy but
08:42 forward-looking infrared radar
08:44 could pick them up to some degree based
08:47 on their heat signatures
08:51 and the advanced aerospace vehicle
08:53 appeared to demonstrate advanced
08:54 acceleration
08:55 aerodynamic and propulsion capability
08:58 beyond anything that
08:59 that we knew existed on the planet
09:03 i'm going to play a flir video that
09:06 many of you may have seen
09:13 i've got sound with the video do you
09:15 have
09:17 a drawing bro there's a whole
09:20 fleet of overlook on the usa
09:23 oh my gosh
09:26 oh going against the wind the wind's 120 09:29 knots west
09:46 it's rotated
09:50 i'll play it one more time
10:08 my gosh they're all going against the
10:12 wind the wind's 120 knots
10:16 west
10:25 that's not an s though is it it's not i
10:28 don't understand
10:29 but if there's a little thing
10:35 now you might ask yourself well like
10:36 what can you prove from from a videotape
10:39 i mean you can see videotapes all over
10:40 the internet and so on
10:42 but this was data fusion their gun
10:45 camera tapes
10:46 they're these video tapes for the pilots
10:48 voice recordings
10:49 data link recordings from aegis and many
10:52 other
10:53 military platforms expert witnesses
10:57 so in fact the data density and this is
11:00 what's changed the field a lot
11:02 our detection capability has gotten so
11:05 advanced
11:06 that we're losing our inability to see
11:09 exactly what's going on
11:13 the flear displays were recorded uh
11:16 there are detailed debriefs of the
11:17 pilots
11:18 in that original new york times article
11:20 you can see a page long debrief of dave
11:22 fraver
11:26 oops
11:28 key assessments the advanced aerospace
11:31 vehicle
11:32 vehicle has no known air vehicle in the
11:34 inventory of
11:35 the us or foreign nation as far as we
11:37 can tell
11:39 low observable characteristics are
11:41 stealthy
11:44 they exhibit advanced aerodynamic
11:46 performance we
11:48 can't imagine how they do it and
11:50 recognize that these are infrared tapes
11:52 from the pilots
11:53 so if there was some kind of hot
11:54 propulsion gases coming out the back you
11:56 would have seen it
11:58 but we don't see that
12:02 they had the advanced capability to
12:03 remain stationary and then take off like
12:06 a shot
12:07 dave favor says it was like somebody
12:09 suddenly shot a bullet
12:13 so how to respond to this the defense
12:16 intelligence agency put out a broad area
12:17 announcement in fact it was unclassified
12:21 they wanted to evaluate 12 potential
12:23 threat areas with regard to these
12:25 advanced aerospace vehicles
12:26 there's a list of them exactly what you
12:30 would think you'd want to know lyft
12:31 propulsion
12:33 signature reduction human effects and so
12:36 on
12:38 now it turned out that anyone any
12:41 aerospace corporation could could apply
12:43 could send in a proposal dia chose
12:46 beagle aerospace as a contractor to
12:48 address the threat
12:49 now there's been buzz on the internet
12:51 about okay well
12:52 senator reid came from nevada and
12:55 bigelow aerospace is in nevada so wasn't
12:57 this just some sweetheart deal
12:59 in fact that's not the case it was a
13:01 broad area announcement anybody could go
13:03 for it
13:04 bigelow was actually a good choice he'd
13:07 spent a lot of his own money because he
13:08 was interested in this area up to this
13:10 point
13:11 investigating the phenomena and he had
13:14 the best proposal
13:17 and so he was tasked and so we set up a
13:19 special organization called bigelow
13:21 aerospace
13:22 advanced space studies so we we call it
13:24 bass
13:26 to do all the things you'd expect a
13:27 program like this to do
13:30 well bass connected contacted me at
13:33 earth tech international
13:35 to collaborate as a subcontractor and i
13:37 agreed to do that
13:41 okay what did i address as a
13:43 subcontractor
13:44 well one of the critical issues is that
13:46 there's so much high level
13:48 security and compartmentalization in
13:50 this subject area
13:51 and there's a lot of it it's difficult
13:54 for contractors
13:55 to obtain expert opinions on advanced
13:58 technologies
13:59 because they would expose why they were
14:02 interested
14:04 so i acted as a surrogate i was
14:07 contracted to commission
14:09 mostly unclassified white papers from
14:12 experts around the globe
14:14 where their particular aerospace related
14:16 subject areas would be in 2050 14:18 as like a general survey of aerospace
14:21 futures
14:22 i decided this would be the best way to
14:23 get the best knowledge we had
14:25 across many technologies without
14:28 actually exposing why we wanted to know
14:32 so i let out 38 contracts over a two
14:35 year period
14:38 i'll show you what the studies are on
14:41 you can read them there positron
14:44 aerospace repulsion
14:46 iec fusion is a compact energy source
14:49 warp drive dark energy extra dimensions
14:52 metallic glasses for aerospace use
14:54 really
14:55 cutting edge kinds of things here's some
14:59 more of the
15:00 papers that i commissioned negative mass
15:02 propulsion
15:03 anti-gravity for aerospace applications
15:06 and so on programmable matter
15:12 invisibility cloaking these are just the
15:15 kind of things that
15:16 we needed to have maximum technical
15:19 input
15:20 from the best people around the globe
15:21 and so that that's what we did that's
15:23 what i did
15:25 now we could wait we told these people
15:26 they could publish their uh
15:28 reports in physics journals and
15:30 engineering journals but of course the
15:32 contractors didn't want to wait for that
15:34 so the defense intelligence agency
15:36 bundled up these 38 papers
15:38 and put them out as defense intelligence
15:41 reference documents
15:42 posted on a jwix server
15:46 that anyone in the government or
15:49 contractors could get access to
15:52 by and large they have not been released
15:54 and to the public yet a couple of like
15:56 that
16:00 so let me give you an example of well
16:02 how does this stuff
16:03 help people who are chasing these really
16:07 difficult problems
16:08 i'm choosing one here metamaterials for
16:10 aerospace use
16:12 i love to talk about really fancy
16:14 materials
16:16 but they're classified however there's a
16:19 lot of materials that have been
16:21 picked up or provided
16:24 even in the public domain i'm going to
16:26 give an example because it shows
16:28 exactly what this structure is for how
16:30 to deal with this
16:32 this is an open source sample it was
16:35 sent anonymously to
16:38 talk show host art bell the fellow
16:41 claimed to be in the military
16:43 he said that this sample was picked up
16:45 in a crash retrieval
16:47 and so he sent it by email so what does
16:50 that mean chain of custody
16:52 non-existent providence questionable
16:56 could be a hoax it could be some slag
16:59 off of some
17:00 foundry floor or whatever however
17:04 it was an unusual sample so we decided
17:07 to
17:07 to take a look at it
17:11 it was a multi-layered bismuth and
17:13 magnesium sample
17:14 bismuth layers less than a human hair
17:17 magnesium sample is about 10 times the
17:20 size of human hair
17:22 supposedly picked up in the crash
17:24 retrieval
17:25 of an advanced aerospace vehicle
17:29 looks like it's been in a crash the
17:31 white lines
17:32 are the bismuth the darker areas are the
17:36 magnesium
17:37 separations
17:40 so the question was what about this
17:43 material so naturally we looked in all
17:44 of the national labs
17:46 we talked to metallurgists we combed the
17:49 entire
17:50 structure of published papers nowhere
17:53 could we find any evidence that anybody
17:55 ever made one of these
17:57 secondly some attempts were made to
18:01 try to reproduce this material but they
18:03 couldn't get the bismuth and magnesium
18:05 layers to bond
18:08 thirdly when we talked to people who
18:11 in the materials field who should know
18:13 they said we don't know why
18:15 anybody would want to make anything like
18:16 this it's not obvious that it has any
18:19 function
18:23 well years later decades later
18:26 actually finally our own science moves
18:29 along
18:30 we move into an area called
18:31 metamaterials and it turns out that
18:34 exactly this combination of materials at
18:37 exactly those
18:39 dimensions turn out to be an excellent
18:43 microscopic waveguide for very high
18:46 frequency electromagnetic radiation
18:48 terahertz frequencies
18:55 so the wavelength is 60 microns which is
18:58 you know pretty small size but it turns
19:01 out that because of the metamaterial
19:02 aspect of
19:04 this material those bismuth layers that
19:08 act as
19:09 wave guides can be 1 20th the size of
19:12 the wavelength and usually when you make
19:14 a waveguide it's got to be about the
19:16 size of the wavelength
19:17 so in fact this turned out to be a
19:20 material that would propagate
19:21 sub-wavelength waveguide effects
19:25 why somebody wants to do that we still
19:27 don't know the answer to that
19:28 but anyway it was amazing that we've
19:30 gone through this and this is the kind
19:32 of
19:32 structure we go through a lot you get a
19:35 material sample of unusual
19:36 characteristics to be evaluated
19:38 the method of manufacture is difficult
19:40 to assess or reproduce
19:42 [Music]
19:43 the purpose of the function is not
19:45 readily apparent
19:47 as with our sample here and then as our
19:50 own technical knowledge moves forward
19:52 we finally see a possible purpose or
19:55 function comes to light
19:57 that sequence is repeated over and over
20:00 in this particular area
20:04 i'll pick a second one here for the
20:08 engineers and physicists in the crowd
20:09 probably be more interesting
20:11 space-time metric engineering this
20:13 happened to be the paper that i myself
20:15 provided
20:17 one of the questions is can the reported
20:21 anomalous
20:22 observables of these advanced aerospace
20:24 vehicles be accounted for on the basis
20:26 of known physics
20:27 i mean you hear people describing craft
20:31 taking right angle turns at high speeds
20:33 and
20:34 other things with the hovering
20:38 and rapid acceleration and so on
20:41 as if the craft didn't have any inertial
20:44 mass
20:45 well it turns out although general
20:47 relativity einstein general relativity
20:49 is usually used in astrophysical
20:50 applications and
20:51 gravity studies and so on you can look
20:54 at it from an engineering standpoint
20:57 so if you take an engineering approach
20:58 to general relativity
21:00 what i just showed can be can be
21:04 understood
21:05 if you could change the space time
21:06 metric the way general relativity i'm
21:08 talking about textbook not
21:10 some fanciful physics you could even get
21:13 faster than light travel alcubierre warp
21:15 drive warp drive as in as in star trek
21:19 again you might think that's a fanciful
21:21 kind of thing but that paper was
21:22 published in
21:23 one of the top general relativity
21:25 journals classical corner gravity
21:27 the warp drive hyper fast travel within
21:30 general relativity
21:32 so if you engineer space time metric
21:35 you can begin to line up observables
21:38 with
21:39 physics that we know and love even if we
21:41 can't reproduce it
21:44 what about the velocity of light
21:45 constraint people are always saying that
21:48 uh you know how could you have a
21:50 wormhole you let you go from one side of
21:52 the universe to the other aren't you
21:53 beating the speed of light
21:55 well what does a physicist and engineer
21:57 mean by the speed of light
21:59 he means this little
22:02 equation here where the speed of light
22:05 is given by 1 over the square root of
22:07 the permittivity times the permeability
22:09 of the vacuum
22:10 so the point is if you re-engineer those
22:13 vacuum parameters
22:15 then you can make the effective speed of
22:16 light higher
22:18 in the engineered region and so those
22:21 are the solution in general relativity
22:22 that are called wormholes
22:24 and again it's not science fiction this
22:26 is just right off the shelf
22:28 uh standard uh textbook general
22:31 relativity applications
22:35 so what that means is a reduced time
22:37 interstellar travel
22:38 is not as skeptics would say you can't
22:40 get from there to here
22:43 advanced et civilizations now or
22:45 ourselves in the future
22:47 not fundamentally constrained by
22:48 physical principles
22:51 the exotic physics for such can be
22:52 addressed in engineering terms
22:54 metric engineering is aware
22:57 does this have any help again by the way
23:00 this paper also was
23:02 published as one of the defense
23:04 intelligence reference documents
23:07 and since we are permitted to uh publish
23:10 in the open literature uh i published
23:12 that paper
23:14 in a british interplanetary science
23:16 journal and engineering journal so
23:18 if you're interested in looking at the
23:20 details you can get
23:22 learn as much as you want to know about
23:24 metric engineering
23:30 and that helped us understand some of
23:32 the aspects i mean you may have heard
23:33 the phrase
23:35 dense stars you get redshift well it
23:38 turns out in this engineered technology
23:39 you get so-called
23:41 blue shift that is frequencies are
23:43 upshifted
23:44 to higher frequencies so for example
23:47 in this room so for example in this room
23:52 most of the radiation coming off our
23:53 bodies off the walls
23:55 and so on is in fact in the infrared
24:01 and but we see things in the visible
24:04 range
24:04 but what happens if you get into a
24:06 volume of space where the
24:08 vacuum has been engineered in the way
24:10 i've been discussing it turns out you
24:12 get a blue shift
24:14 so in fact the infrared that you don't
24:16 ordinarily see
24:18 can get blue shifted up into the visible
24:20 so it's not surprising that all these
24:22 crafts should be so luminous
24:24 now the downside from all of this is the
24:26 fact that visible light which
24:29 doesn't have any particularly harmful
24:31 effects
24:32 gets blue shifted up into
24:37 the ultraviolet so you get too close to
24:39 the landing craft you might get a
24:41 sunburn
24:42 or off into the soft x-ray region so the
24:46 chance of
24:47 radiation poisoning so
24:50 if you run across one of these sitting
24:51 on the ground i would recommend you
24:53 don't and it's powered up i'd recommend
24:54 you don't
24:55 brush up and
24:58 well that helped us to understand we as
25:00 part of this program we looked at some
25:02 cases
25:03 that were really good from brazil 77-78 25:09 it was like close encounters of the
25:10 third kind
25:12 thousand pages of documents all done by
25:14 the brazilian air force investigative
25:16 team
25:17 500 photographs 15 hours of motion film
25:20 a lot of medical injuries
25:24 i know you probably can't read that from
25:26 here but just a list of
25:28 the different kinds of medical injuries
25:29 that occurred when people encountered
25:31 these
25:33 craft at close range
25:36 and it has some overlap with cases that
25:38 we've investigated during the program
25:40 of injuries occurring
25:45 well despite the progress in the atip
25:47 program let's face it
25:48 topic is inherently anomalous right
25:55 therefore despite the reality of the
25:56 observations
25:58 and all the people that we interact with
26:00 in the intelligence community
26:02 and the pentagon agree the data is there
26:05 it's it's real nonetheless the topic
26:08 doesn't fit smoothly into
26:10 known profiles of government programs
26:12 for sure
26:14 and by virtue of natural security
26:15 implications it's
26:17 high compartmentalization of the topic
26:19 therefore slow
26:21 pace of cumulative progress and
26:22 integration we call them stove pipes
26:24 you have a lot of people with lots of
26:27 detailed
26:28 information about some particular aspect
26:30 but they don't talk to each other
26:32 even it's sitting at the next desk
26:37 and let's face it advocacy of the issue
26:39 in government circles is not viewed as
26:41 career enhancing
26:45 in part because despite the weirdness of
26:49 the subject
26:50 if you don't make a lot of progress you
26:52 know it doesn't look good on your resume
26:55 that you're
26:56 moving up the line so because of that
26:59 [Music]
27:00 there's a forward story many of us
27:04 involved in the program
27:06 decided that there should be an outreach
27:08 program in the public sector
27:11 so this is the forward story the goal
27:14 was to establish a broad-based
27:15 high-quality scientific community of
27:17 interest
27:18 in the public sector concerning these
27:22 unidentified aerial phenomena and other
27:25 related
27:25 leading-edge topics and so we got
27:29 together and formed a company called to
27:31 the stars academy of arts and science
27:35 it was co-founded by entrepreneur tom
27:38 delong
27:39 i'll talk about him in a minute senior
27:41 intelligence officers from the
27:43 department of defense and cia
27:45 and distinguished research scientists we
27:48 all banded together
27:50 to form this academy
27:53 it was set up as a public benefit
27:54 corporation
27:56 so the public can invest and therefore
27:58 it's owned by the public
28:01 so this is something new whatever comes
28:03 out of any of the research
28:06 or any of the released of information is
28:08 actually going to be owned by the public
28:09 it's not going to disappear into a black
28:11 hole
28:13 very transparent structure if you go to
28:15 the website you can see
28:17 everything from the financial structure
28:20 to
28:20 the activities and we do have a
28:23 web-based
28:24 community of interest where things get
28:26 posted
28:27 for example those this f-18 28:32 flear tape i show we now have three of
28:34 them up there
28:35 probably more to come
28:39 all right well who are the principals of
28:40 this organization
28:42 tom delonge blink 182 rock star
28:47 frankly i'd never heard of 182.
28:51 but my son told me oh yeah we know about
28:53 blink 182.
28:55 but anyway in addition to being the rock
28:58 star that he is
29:00 he's also a director and producer puts
29:02 out books and music and film and so on
29:04 and he's had a lifelong interest in the
29:07 ufo area
29:08 and so he started talking with various
29:11 people
29:12 and he was kind of the
29:16 i could you say the action-oriented
29:19 person who said why don't we set up
29:21 something why don't we
29:22 make this more available to the public
29:24 and he got to a number of us
29:26 and so we all began to band together lou
29:29 elizondo
29:30 who was in fact the department of
29:33 defense's the pentagon's 8-tip
29:35 program director resigned from the
29:37 pentagon
29:39 and joined us chris mellon
29:43 20-year career deputy assistant
29:45 secretary of defense for intelligence
29:47 minority staff director of the senate
29:48 select committee intelligence
29:50 he joined us we got
29:54 jim simavan 25-year career in cia's
29:57 director of operation
29:59 he was the real james bond kind of guy
30:05 steve justice just retired as program
30:08 director for the billion dollar programs
30:11 at lockheed martin skunk works he joined
30:14 us
30:17 and then i agreed to be on the board so
30:20 i joined them
30:21 in addition to my science and
30:23 engineering background i've had a lot of
30:25 activity and in classified areas so
30:29 i was it was a natural fit for me
30:31 interacting with all these people
30:36 we also put together a policy and
30:37 scientific advisory panel of the best
30:40 people we could find
30:41 chris mellon agreed to be the chair
30:46 dr come kelleher he was actually the
30:48 deputy administrator
30:50 at bigelow aerospace to run the atip
30:53 program out of the pentagon
30:58 dr gary nolan top genetics genetics
31:02 professor at stanford university
31:06 dr khan 30-year career with cia counter
31:09 biological weapons program
31:12 dr rapp professor of military and
31:14 emergency medicine
31:15 uniform services university dr gilpin
31:19 consultant on academic biomedical
31:21 research and research law
31:22 so we put together a team as panelists
31:26 to keep us on the straight and narrow of
31:28 really top people
31:29 who have wonderful backgrounds and
31:34 really want to see scientific work be
31:37 done in this area
31:40 so the goals for the to the stars
31:42 academy are promote the concept that
31:44 such forefront topics as ufos
31:46 seti consciousness studies even
31:50 telepathy and psychokinesis should not
31:51 be considered taboo for serious
31:53 scientific
31:54 consideration so i mean it's a perfect
31:56 match to the ssc
31:58 because that's our goal in the ssc as
32:00 well
32:02 and of course a big idea is to generate
32:05 funding to underwrite significant
32:06 research in these areas
32:08 develop user-friendly databases so
32:11 information that
32:12 is generated can be accessed by anyone
32:16 provide positive support for
32:18 collaborative government
32:20 aerospace industry and academic efforts
32:23 to accomplish all of the above so we
32:28 want to act as the glue
32:30 in the public sector and create
32:33 entertainment properties books and
32:34 documentaries and so on so that
32:36 whatever is learned can be generated
32:40 can be delivered out to the public
32:45 uh the structure of the organizations
32:47 has a science structure
32:50 an aerospace structure
32:53 and an entertainment division
33:00 what are the activities of this
33:02 organization to date
33:04 actually we were responsible for
33:06 legitimizing
33:07 the topic in the mainstream press
33:10 that story that came out in the new york
33:12 times and so on
33:14 which then got picked up by washington
33:16 post cnn
33:17 fox news was based on agreed upon
33:20 interviews with those of us that i've
33:23 just gone
33:24 through a list of
33:28 and given the quality of the sources
33:30 coming out from the shadows for example
33:33 ex-senate majority leader harry reid top
33:36 f-18 pilots
33:38 significant department of defense and
33:40 intelligence community officials
33:42 the bar has been raised on
33:43 legitimization of this topic
33:46 in the public arena we think that's an
33:48 accomplished
33:49 goal to date
33:52 and via the community of interest
33:54 postings on the website
33:57 we now have three high quality f-18 34:00 video tapes of unidentified error
34:02 phenomena encounters
34:04 they've been previously languishing in
34:05 the pentagon servers
34:07 nobody doing that much with them
34:11 these are still being generated one of
34:13 the tapes is from 2016 off the east
34:16 coast
34:16 of the united states i mean there are
34:20 a lot more tapes hopefully we'll we'll
34:22 get a lot more of them posted
34:27 uh we only we don't just produce
34:29 positive results what
34:31 people would think would be supportive
34:32 results one of our
34:35 scientists science advisors is gary
34:38 nolan
34:39 from from stanford
34:43 university who's a genetics expert
34:46 and there had been claims that some
34:50 small humanoid skeleton found in chile
34:53 so-called atacama humanoid you know
34:56 might be
34:58 e.t you can see why somebody might
35:02 might think that if you see the
35:04 structure but anyway nolan
35:06 and people from other universities put
35:08 together a complete genetics thing
35:11 and uh did the entire genome and found
35:14 that in fact no
35:15 unfortunately this is not evidence of et
35:19 it's a deformed human and so that's up
35:22 on the website if you want to
35:23 read the paper it was published in one
35:25 of the top genetics journals
35:27 very well peer-reviewed
35:32 and meetings are being set up with
35:34 people from other countries because
35:36 other countries who also have materials
35:40 don't necessarily want to give them to
35:41 the us government because they disappear
35:42 in a black hole and they never learn
35:44 anything
35:45 but given our commitment as a public
35:48 benefit corporation
35:49 that that's not going to happen with us
35:51 they're now talking to us
35:53 and we're collaborating on obtaining
35:55 materials from
35:56 foreign countries
36:04 and of course we're negotiating with
36:05 media outlets to get all this out
36:07 in the public in the form of
36:09 documentaries or tv shows or whatever
36:13 so basically that's the back story and
36:15 the forward story
36:16 and i'm glad to answer any questions
36:19 i'll answer it either i can't thank you
36:34 thank you for a terrific presentation um
36:37 so your good friend john alexander
36:39 published a book
36:40 and i know i'll have a chance to ask him
36:41 this too
36:43 why was it so hard for him to find who
36:46 was
36:47 you know who's doing the research who
36:49 was holding
36:50 files on ufos and his book he said
36:54 everybody thought that somebody else was
36:56 doing it but
36:57 you know said everybody said in all the
37:00 departments
37:01 it's not me it's not us they're doing it
37:04 it was somebody else doing it
37:07 and uh if if materials are being held in
37:11 special access programs uh
37:14 casual conversation even with high-level
37:17 people
37:18 and who know your interests and they're
37:19 interested too
37:21 won't necessarily reveal the facts
37:24 well i think lou elizondo even said his
37:26 own boss wasn't quite sure what he was
37:28 doing so i don't know if that was true
37:30 that's true
37:34 thank you um uh
37:38 my name is joe bookman i was part of the
37:40 organizers of the 2013 citizens hearing
37:42 which was an attempt to bring the best
37:43 of the evidence
37:44 before six or four members of congress i
37:47 don't know if you were aware of that if
37:48 you were i'd be interested in
37:50 your take on it but um my second
37:52 question then would be
37:53 out of everything you said i thought one
37:55 of the most interesting things was there
37:56 are a lot more tapes
37:58 um are those classified and
38:01 if not or even if they are can you
38:05 characterize them in any way or tell us
38:07 what you might be about they're not a
38:09 lot different from this
38:11 and some of them are classified because
38:13 of where they were taken
38:16 but as far as the content of what we're
38:18 interested in from a technical
38:20 standpoint they're not that different
38:23 and provided you strike out the
38:27 say location and so on then there's a
38:30 chance of getting them declassified and
38:32 we're working on that
38:34 yeah if that was a tv channel i'd be
38:36 quite likely to
38:38 and generally speaking out of the whole
38:40 world of the ufo field or
38:41 more specifically regarding that
38:43 citizens hearing from five years ago
38:45 is there anything you found useful
38:47 beneficial
38:48 i know there's a lot of hoax tourism and
38:51 posterism and
38:52 fraud involved in what's called
38:54 technology
38:57 well you have to pick and choose among
38:59 the data i'm familiar with the
39:01 citizens hearing and so on and certainly
39:04 the
39:05 depositions by the
39:09 individuals who were in the launch
39:12 towers for missiles
39:14 who had bob salas for example
39:17 that's all really good data and so and
39:20 the faa administrator who came forward
39:23 all good data thank you hey
39:28 thanks very much for the talk uh um i
39:31 wanted to bring up something um in
39:33 regards to um
39:34 the nature of the release and i guess it
39:37 was the figure was 22 million as well as
39:39 a program that was stated to be closed
39:43 i guess it's i guess it might be a leap
39:46 but i think uh it's
39:47 basically a common knowledge amongst uh
39:50 ufo researchers that
39:51 the spending in actualities and um you
39:54 know the billions if not more
39:56 um so some people in the ufo research
39:59 community have
40:01 you know raised the question of you know
40:03 is this a wooden duck on the pond
40:06 uh to state a figure so low is 22 40:08 million and then state that the
40:10 program no longer exists um i was hoping
40:13 that you might make some
40:14 comments on uh the great deal of concern
40:18 i think that has risen from these
40:20 these statements thank you that's a fair
40:23 concern
40:24 this 22 million dollar program was one
40:27 particular program
40:30 that doesn't say there weren't other
40:31 programs with other funding levels
40:34 and so it isn't like suddenly there was
40:37 this one program
40:39 it didn't last long didn't have that
40:41 much money and it shut down
40:43 i mean interest is continuing
40:45 negotiations are continuing
40:47 other programs are being looked at
40:51 so a lot is going on i and my colleagues
40:54 spend a lot of time in washington
40:56 talking to committees that
41:00 are looking at this from many different
41:01 angles so
41:03 the general view that oil is just one
41:05 program came forward
41:07 didn't provide much of value and then it
41:10 got cancelled
41:12 that's that's not really the case and
41:13 also those those figures are associated
41:15 with the figures that went out to
41:17 contractors
41:18 but that doesn't mean that people within
41:20 the system aren't still
41:22 working on it
41:25 you know um all of us maverick
41:29 and inventors working in our garages on
41:32 metric engineering devices is there
41:35 going to be a clearinghouse for
41:36 um people to um trade discoveries like
41:39 just the thing about
41:40 the frequency shift oh we can all be
41:43 looking for
41:43 line shifts and lasers to see if we
41:46 generate
41:47 micro effects in that but just something
41:50 like that is
41:51 incredibly valuable but maybe there's a
41:53 lot of other things like that
41:55 well we have a maverick and vendor
41:57 program at earth tech international my
41:59 organization and also the to the stars
42:01 academy
42:02 is putting together a research
42:04 organization so
42:06 if you're doing symmetric engineering in
42:08 your lab and you've got some laser
42:09 shifting and frequency
42:10 bring them all we'll look at them okay
42:15 thank you very much thank you 

==========oEjxczLgSO4=========

00:00 everybody here we go okay back there
00:01 good to go okay Jam thank you very much
00:05 what I'd like to do first is just begin
00:07 by by thanking you all for having me
00:10 here this evening
00:12 Jan's absolutely right I hate to admit
00:15 that I'm new to this but I'm new to you
00:19 this has been a topic that's been very
00:22 near and dear to my heart and those are
00:24 some of my colleagues for quite some
00:26 time but truth be told there's some
00:29 folks here that probably need more
00:31 recognition certainly more than me but
00:34 probably more than just about anybody
00:36 else in this endeavor and and special
00:40 thanks to Jan and chase thank you very
00:42 much
00:43 as Jan had said you know I had the
00:51 protection of an entire apparatus a
00:53 national security organization at my
00:57 disposal and I was able to operate in a
01:01 way where I had a significant budget for
01:04 most of the time I had a staff I had
01:06 resources ahead I had things that I
01:09 could use that were at my disposal to
01:12 get a better understanding of this and
01:14 they could also operate in a good degree
01:16 of anonymity which means I didn't have
01:19 to worry about a lot of things that you
01:20 all do and so here's Jan and chase and
01:24 everybody else in this room doing their
01:26 their job day in and day out and
01:29 committed to something where sometimes
01:31 people may have associated you as being
01:33 fringe or being out there and all along
01:37 you were right so I'd like to commend
01:43 you on that but one other person in this
01:45 in this audience two people are
01:48 committing me for coming out and they're
01:51 saying yo the first time the US
01:52 government's coming out to that same
01:54 knowledge program and and here you are
01:56 speaking for the first time about the
01:59 phenomena but let's not forget it was
02:03 not the first person to come out and and
02:08 and talk on behalf of a very
02:11 controversial subject on behalf
02:13 to their country there was one other
02:15 person in this audience I did it before
02:17 me and I spent that individual went
02:21 through some of the same trials and
02:22 tribulations if not maybe even more so
02:24 and that's mr. Nick Pope over here so
02:32 the reason why I say that the ward is
02:36 truly truly lovely but but I have to
02:40 admit there's probably other people in
02:41 this audience the majority of people in
02:44 this audience I probably deserve it a
02:45 little bit more than me but I humbly
02:48 appreciate that the gesture has
02:49 certainly certainly appreciated and it
02:51 will cherish it but mr. Nick Pope
02:54 decided to come out at a time when this
02:57 topic not only was a controversial but
03:01 we were we were really struggling with a
03:04 lot of things worldwide and so I will be
03:08 spending a little bit of time with him
03:09 later on as I certainly would like to to
03:12 share some of his thoughts and ideas and
03:15 perspectives and observations I think
03:18 between maybe what his organization did
03:20 and what our organization did we may be
03:23 able to better if you will as a
03:26 collective whole push this finally to
03:30 the finish line and by the way hopefully
03:32 after tonight's presentation we'll get
03:34 the wraps of some questions here I I
03:36 will try not to Yammer on too long but
03:40 hopefully you will have the same
03:43 understanding that I do and that is I
03:46 think the same time next year we're
03:49 going to have a fundamentally different
03:50 conversation I think I think disclosure
03:55 already occurred I don't think
03:58 necessarily disclosure as an event I
04:00 think it's a process and I think that
04:02 process began and that is entirely in
04:05 large part by the help of you you folks
04:09 have a heck of a lot more to risk than I
04:11 did because you had neighbors to talk to
04:14 that would look at you and kind of say
04:16 what are you doing you had spouses you
04:18 had children you had family and you know
04:22 you I think you all risked a hell of a
04:24 lot yourself so
04:26 with that said I'd like to go ahead and
04:27 start with a presentation all right so
04:30 here we go
04:30 I've been told I can kind of control it
04:34 myself with a clicker a laptop of course
04:38 trained observer so I think when this
04:43 first came out everybody was kind of
04:45 asking some questions about what this
04:46 program is what I'd like to do tonight
04:48 is just briefly go over a little bit
04:50 about the program a little bit of the
04:52 history what it is what it isn't and
04:54 then maybe where do we go next
04:57 what do we do so as you see here
04:59 advanced aerospace threat identification
05:02 program it is indeed aerospace I know
05:05 some folks that said aviation some folks
05:07 at the Pentagon said aviation I can
05:10 assure you here tonight it is indeed
05:12 advanced aerospace threat identification
05:15 program eight it and some of the
05:17 documentation that has come out for me
05:20 that was authored by members of Congress
05:23 you will see quite clearly back in 2009 05:26 it is indeed called a chip advanced
05:29 aerospace now why is that important I
05:33 don't know maybe it's not important but
05:34 I think it's what I do think is
05:37 important that when we're here talking
05:39 about facts that's a fact and so I think
05:44 it's important that we also talked to
05:46 saying the same language so in this
05:48 particular case the program actually
05:50 began from another program we're gonna
05:52 get into that tonight this is the
05:57 contract focused for a tip pretty heavy
06:03 stuff no we weren't looking at balloons
06:06 no we weren't looking at drones we
06:09 weren't looking at aircraft this is real
06:12 this is what your twenty two million
06:14 dollars worth of tax money was spent on
06:17 and there's a lot of it so I'll give you
06:22 a minute to take a look at it some of
06:24 the highlights they're human effects
06:27 what does that mean signature reduction
06:31 I mean a lot of this stuff you would
06:33 look and say yeah this is definitely DoD
06:34 centric this is something that the
06:35 Department of Defense national security
06:38 BRABUS would definitely be interested in
06:40 some of these other stuff you got to
06:42 kind of scratch your head and say well
06:44 is that a DoD mission I would submit to
06:48 you yes absolutely it is especially when
06:51 you're trying to protect Airmen and when
06:53 you try to protect sailors and soldiers
06:56 my focus before I go to the next slide
06:59 was to focus on title 10 which means DoD
07:03 specific there's a big difference
07:04 between looking at DoD folks and looking
07:08 at the rest of the world so when they
07:10 asked you did you talk to civilians did
07:12 you talk to these people no we didn't we
07:15 focused on military and by the way that
07:18 was a lot it's not like this happens
07:20 once and twosies
07:21 there was a significant amount of volume
07:23 just focusing on that I'd like to go
07:25 back to that slide for just a second
07:28 let's look at the very bottom where we
07:30 say investigating legitimacy of
07:32 currently observed phenomena this is
07:37 briefed to the senior levels of the
07:39 Department of Defense we choose our
07:41 words very carefully they are deliberate
07:45 we write words on purpose because they
07:47 mean something so when you're saying
07:51 investigate the legitimacy of currently
07:55 not in the past currently observed
07:58 phenomena that's what we're doing and
08:04 again we'll open this up for questions
08:06 and so if anybody has any I'm sure
08:08 they'll be some questions on the slides
08:10 of course at the bottom are they
08:13 achievable by current understanding of
08:15 physics and engineering and if not what
08:17 research studies is required in order to
08:22 achieve that ok so what does all those
08:29 studies really distilled down to and a
08:32 lot of you have heard about the five
08:34 observables well what you really are
08:37 looking at on this trip this has a laser
08:39 pointer maybe it does maybe it doesn't
08:40 I'm not gonna try so if you look at the
08:44 top left you're talking about
08:47 instantaneous acceleration you've heard
08:48 that a lot but why from a DoD
08:50 perspective with that
08:51 something important well as you see here
08:53 thrust vectoring g-force protection
08:55 right for our pilots maneuverability
08:59 enhance maneuverability the ability to -
09:01 to take an aircraft from point A to
09:04 point B and then Pat back to point a
09:06 again very quickly without having any
09:10 ill effects on on the human side the
09:14 next one is hypersonic velocity again
09:17 from a DoD perspective you can imagine
09:19 why that would be important so that
09:22 means I can get my people and equipment
09:24 very quickly anywhere in the world
09:27 ending the invasion they can't go as
09:30 fast as me and then first strike
09:33 capability in a strategic type
09:36 environment better to know that if
09:38 you're gonna go to war with an enemy
09:39 that you can strike first okay so the
09:45 other one is low observability it's kind
09:47 of falling off the slide there but
09:48 you'll have to trust me it says low
09:50 observability a bit of an oxymoron when
09:52 we say it's an observable but it was but
09:57 from a DoD perspective why would that be
09:59 important I want to go back to my level
10:01 there we go
10:03 reduce cross section okay so if you if
10:06 you lower your your observability you're
10:08 lowering your cross section
10:09 survivability if they can't see you they
10:11 can't eat you and then anonymity maybe
10:16 you don't necessarily want to advertise
10:17 that you're coming in somewhere there
10:18 you're gonna do something right these
10:20 new stealth aircraft and this new
10:22 stealth helicopter that everybody talked
10:23 about on the bin Laden raid you know
10:25 whoa
10:27 losses at multi medium travel why would
10:32 that be important again here you see
10:34 here there's some strategic surprise
10:36 meaning you now have an object that can
10:38 operate in air water space hmm probably
10:42 gives you some target flexibility and
10:44 lattis last but not least battle space
10:47 and dominance meaning you can operate in
10:49 virtually all environments anytime
10:52 anywhere and then the last one is
10:55 positive lift and of course why would
10:59 that be important as we see here we're
11:02 looking at flight precision
11:04 I do not have to be moving like an
11:06 aircraft to generate lift under my wings
11:08 that would be tremendous benefit loiter
11:13 capability I can stay on time on target
11:15 for longer and then last but not least
11:19 decreased signature so you can see these
11:23 these focus areas are really DoD centric
11:27 they are part of the core DoD mission
11:30 both from a defense of an offensive
11:32 perspective so this is how those five
11:37 cervicals that we we saw the
11:39 commonalities if you will how they fit
11:42 within the DoD mission because some
11:44 people will ask you you know why why was
11:46 DoD looking at this should NASA be
11:48 looking at it should some people Sheriff
11:49 NASA could look at it but so should we
11:52 next slide is I guess it's me I'm
11:58 hearing I'm hearing whispers behind the
11:59 curtain that's you okay so the next few
12:05 slides are a little bit of a tip history
12:08 here I'm not going to read word for word
12:10 but what I'm going to do is just kind of
12:12 paraphrase there were three senators
12:15 senator Reed Center anyway sitter
12:19 Stevens bipartisan Republican and
12:21 Democrat they all agreed that there was
12:26 sufficient information to warrant
12:29 increased study into the phenomenon they
12:32 along with Senator John Glenn former
12:35 astronaut got together and they began to
12:39 scratch their heads and figure out what
12:40 is the best way to do it well in
12:42 Congress you give money to an
12:43 organization that's capable of doing
12:45 something with it in this case the money
12:47 was provided to an organization called
12:49 the Defense Intelligence Agency it's
12:51 kind of like the CIA equivalent for DoD
12:54 it went to this small little office and
12:56 the initial contract vehicle was called
12:59 all SAP advanced aerospace weapons
13:02 special application programs system
13:05 application program a lot of folks will
13:07 say well Lou when you first came out why
13:10 didn't you just tell us that well the
13:13 reason is because I wasn't really part
13:15 of that
13:16 and that's really not my place discuss a
13:19 mission and an organization that I was
13:22 really walking into the tail end I was
13:25 brought in to conduct
13:26 counterintelligence and Security for an
13:29 organization that was in the process of
13:31 evolving into something else
13:33 there was another director running that
13:35 program so it would be disingenuous for
13:37 me to simply say well a tip is really
13:41 awesome
13:42 well it evolved from all set but it is
13:45 not awesome and I think the
13:47 documentation that's beginning to come
13:49 out into the public forum people are
13:51 beginning to realize that it wasn't a
13:53 purpose attempt to try to subdue or to
13:56 to hide or conceal the relationship I
13:59 just wasn't really qualified to talk
14:01 about it and what I don't want to do is
14:03 hopefully you're beginning to learn here
14:04 is provide information that I'm not
14:07 qualified to discuss with you there's
14:10 two ground rules as far as I'm concerned
14:11 involving this program I'll answer any
14:14 question you have but there's only
14:15 there's something I can't discuss which
14:18 is classified information don't ask me
14:20 I'm not going to tell you if it requires
14:21 a classified answer I am not going to
14:23 violate my oath nor my teeth my mind out
14:26 my non-disclosure agreement with the US
14:28 government but short of that all the
14:31 answer and if I don't have any answer
14:32 I'm gonna tell you I don't have an
14:34 answer I don't know I'll be completely
14:36 as forthcoming as I can because there
14:37 are things I don't know in fact there's
14:39 a lot more I don't know that I do know
14:41 but that's okay that's why we have to
14:43 continue to seek to find the answers and
14:45 collect the data because ultimately the
14:47 data will speak for itself the truth she
14:50 you know she's funny she always speaks
14:52 sometimes she whispers so you have to
14:55 listen real carefully but but if you
14:57 listen hard enough you you can you can
14:59 hear her speak so that's a little bit of
15:02 the history on this slide here the in
15:05 2008 the program was really only awesome
15:08 for a very very short period of time I
15:11 might hurt myself with this okay thank
15:17 you
15:17 so as you see here towards the end in
15:21 2008 the program was already beginning
15:23 to evolve the original asset portfolio
15:27 was much
15:29 that the eight the decision was made
15:31 early on that we would go ahead and
15:33 focus the effort more to the phenomena
15:36 specific looking at the observables and
15:39 the identifiable what can we look at
15:41 what can we collect on what can we
15:44 report on back to senior DoD leadership
15:46 because that's what they're concerned
15:48 with and try to remove as much
15:50 speculation supposition and any windows
15:53 as possible out of the calculus so more
15:57 history so as you see here the 2008 to
16:01 2009 there's a there's there's a lot of
16:05 collection going on a lot to the point
16:08 where we're we're we're almost becoming
16:10 overloaded with the results in the data
16:12 it's becoming quite clear to us that
16:15 there is much more to this portfolio
16:17 than we envisioned and I suspect when
16:21 you look at this 2009 congressional
16:23 letter sent to DoD leadership Congress
16:26 was aware of that too to the point where
16:28 we were worried there may be a potential
16:31 counterintelligence threat maybe there
16:33 were foreign adversaries that were
16:35 interested in what we were collecting
16:37 that's how much we were collecting you
16:41 see done here 2009 specific elements of
16:45 DoD resists the effort this is a detail
16:48 I really haven't talked about much you
16:52 know everybody handles this information
16:53 differently and then the department is
16:56 no different then and out here in the
16:58 public forum people have their ideas
17:00 that have their preconceived notions or
17:02 have their bias and they have their
17:04 belief systems and by no means do I have
17:08 the right or the qualifications to tell
17:10 anybody what they should or should not
17:11 believe in but there are some people who
17:14 have a great deal of conviction just as
17:17 you have conviction right now in the UAP
17:20 UFO phenomena they have equal conviction
17:23 from a theological perspective in their
17:26 own and by the way that contradicts with
17:28 what we were trying to do for better for
17:30 worse and I'm not saying that's good I'm
17:32 not saying it's bad I'm just saying it's
17:33 a fact that there were elements within
17:35 the department that rigorously oppose
17:37 what we were trying to do not because
17:40 the results were not real
17:42 but because it contradicted their view
17:49 it's all I got to say about that 2003 13 17:57 through 2014 you see where they say some
18:01 folks have said in the past by the way
18:03 the Department of Defense is a fantastic
18:06 organization true patriots these are
18:08 folks that give they're there they're
18:09 there they sacrifice their family's
18:11 livelihood in their life to to defend us
18:14 so so this is not necessarily a hit on
18:18 the department but sometimes the
18:22 department it's a big organization
18:23 sometimes they don't necessarily have
18:26 all the data in front of them all the
18:28 time and so when they said the program
18:29 ended in 2012 18:31 well the funding was actually into 2013 18:33 and after 2013 there was some other
18:37 funding vehicles that were done to get
18:39 it through 2013 and 2014 now we'll go
18:42 into detail what happened with those
18:43 fundings the funding actually came
18:44 through it actually wound up getting
18:45 rerouted to another organization because
18:47 the language was vague and so therefore
18:49 we were forced to continue the program
18:52 on minimal funds now people say well the
18:54 funding dries up so does an organization
18:56 in the program that's not true how many
18:59 of you have ever served in the military
19:00 or are serving in the military show of
19:02 hands real quick ever sir fantastic so
19:07 you know as a good soldier when you are
19:10 given a mission you're given in order to
19:11 guard your posts you guard your posts
19:14 until you are relieved of that
19:15 responsibility
19:17 well that order never came for us and in
19:20 the Department of Defense is always a
19:22 paper trail when you establish an
19:24 organization there's a paper trail when
19:27 you disestablish an organization there's
19:29 a paper trail you won't find one for
19:32 this program so I think that's I think
19:34 that's very important that people
19:36 understand that the program never really
19:39 went away
19:39 sure funding for the 2013 went away but
19:43 the program never went away
19:45 we never told you no longer have to
19:48 guard your tub
19:50 so 2017 some guy makes oops some guy
19:55 makes a dumb decision to - I guess leave
19:59 the Department of Defense you know and
20:04 have some conversations and in 2000 opto
20:08 BER 4th 2017 the rest is history
20:12 so let's go into a little bit about what
20:14 a tip is a tip evolved from all SAP that
20:19 is absolutely true all settings just for
20:22 a short period of time under another
20:23 director to focus on the new ap specific
20:27 capabilities and concentrated on the
20:30 what and how interrogatives not that who
20:34 not the wet but what is it and how does
20:38 it work that's it and if we could
20:41 accomplish that hopefully smarter people
20:43 in the department to figure out who's
20:45 behind the wheel what are their
20:46 intentions were they from etc a tip was
20:50 comprised of US government contractor
20:53 and military personnel it's a fact
20:55 everybody hears about Bigelow Aerospace
20:58 that is a true statement
21:01 we worked with academics we worked with
21:04 the services we worked with certain
21:08 elements in the intelligence community
21:09 we worked with anybody in everybody with
21:12 a military Nexus that we could talk to
21:14 that could provide some information cast
21:17 a wide net a tip Commission large
21:22 volumes of related research data
21:25 academic studies and collected data even
21:28 from the field true statement volumes
21:32 and volumes of information I cannot go
21:35 into detail specifically on what some of
21:36 that is because every meets with
21:38 classified I believe two days ago a
21:41 laundry list of some of our studies have
21:43 come out I'll be at one of them was
21:45 classified I can tell you that that is a
21:49 correct list that is a that is a true
21:53 list of academic studies to get a chance
21:56 to review them I think you'll agree that
21:58 once again we're not really talking
22:00 about the
22:04 much of a tip information remains FOIA
22:07 exempt for you they sent me everything's
22:12 available no it's not exceptions one in
22:16 five why would you mark information FOIA
22:22 exempt
22:23 well for one so that adversary never
22:27 gets a chance to see it people say well
22:30 I ain't existed I should be able to find
22:32 it
22:32 not necessarily some of the documents
22:35 that were recently realists and released
22:37 as a result if you take a look at a
22:40 recent letter that I supposedly came
22:44 from Senator Reid on the very last page
22:46 at the very bottom you're going to see a
22:47 really interesting little word words it
22:50 actually says for you exempt that's
22:54 right we use that sometimes now we don't
22:58 use it to keep a secret from the
22:59 American people in fact that's illegal
23:01 what we do is we use it to keep it out
23:03 of the hands of foreign adversaries and
23:05 it is an effective tool so keep in mind
23:08 a lot of the counter-argument as well
23:12 you're keeping the secret from the
23:13 American people that is not the case if
23:16 we had a mechanism where we could inform
23:18 every American citizen and ensure it
23:21 didn't get out into enemy hands we would
23:23 do it
23:24 the government doesn't try to keep
23:25 secrets from you it tries to keep
23:27 secrets from the enemy and there's no
23:30 way to tell 500 million people in one
23:33 geographic region and not let that get
23:36 out somewhere else so so that is why a
23:39 lot of this information you see is FOIA
23:42 exempt now is it the right thing to do
23:44 is that the wrong thing to do I don't
23:46 know and and I I don't know
23:48 is it an effective mechanism absolutely
23:51 it is okay so what a tip isn't this is
24:02 just a small sample of things that we
24:06 have heard over time that people have
24:09 speculated upon so let me see if I can
24:10 just address it head-on
24:12 a tip ended in 2012 24:14 well I think it's pretty clear that
24:16 didn't happen a tip found nothing of
24:19 significance not true in fact I think
24:24 matter of fact that we even have the
24:26 five observables and and we can have an
24:28 honest conversation about the physics
24:30 shows that we did achieve for something
24:33 and when I say we folks I'm not saying
24:35 me not Lisa was on though I'm talking
24:37 about the fantastic human beings I left
24:40 behind at the Department of Defense
24:41 those are the true heroes those are the
24:44 folks that still Ramin back there
24:46 anonymous working day-in day-out
24:49 making this happen so a tip did find a
24:55 lot of things with significance a tip
24:57 was a political favor let's get this
25:01 straight by the way for the record I'm a
25:03 political I don't care if a Republican
25:06 Democrat independent don't know don't
25:08 care
25:09 my job is to serve whoever is in charge
25:11 at the time my job is also to serve you
25:15 the American people the taxpayer you
25:17 employ me so therefore my loyalty is to
25:20 you as a result people say well this was
25:25 something that Senator Reid as a favor
25:27 to his one of his constituents Bob
25:29 Bigelow I saw this process work by the
25:33 way
25:33 Bigelow Aerospace was chosen by none
25:36 other than dia and by the way a formal
25:39 contract selection committee the senator
25:43 had nothing to do with it in fact he
25:45 could not get involved with it so I
25:49 think that's important distinction
25:50 because people in the absence of
25:54 information in that void we as human
25:57 beings have a tendency to fill that void
25:59 with either what we know what we think
26:03 and even sometimes what we don't know so
26:07 I want to make sure it's very clear that
26:08 it was not a political there was a
26:10 bipartisan effort by both Democrats and
26:12 Republicans all of them served their
26:15 country honorably all of them had served
26:17 in the military Senator in a way
26:20 literally gave his right arm for his
26:22 country senator Stevens what is now
26:25 coming to light actually witnessed one
26:27 of these things went
26:28 was a pilot so I think I think we're
26:34 gonna have a conversation about
26:35 political favors we at least need to
26:37 speak truth to power when we have that
26:40 conversation a tip was only academic
26:44 yeah we produce a lot of academic
26:45 studies and we commissioned a hell of a
26:47 lot of reports but that's not all
26:52 a tip was involved with actually
26:55 speaking with individuals collecting
26:57 electro-optical data collecting radar
26:58 data talking to the eyewitnesses and
27:01 these eyewitnesses are people keep in
27:03 mind to have security clearances they
27:05 are trained observers in some cases we
27:06 have spent millions of dollars into
27:09 their training whether special
27:11 operations whether their pilots were
27:13 their intelligence officers they have
27:15 been paid to be critical thinkers and
27:17 they have been trained to look at a
27:18 silhouette and determine if that's a mid
27:20 25 a mig-29 it's a 90 degree roll and
27:23 it's at 200 kilometers in front of me
27:25 traveling at 200 knots these are some of
27:33 the data points that we use when
27:36 collecting the data and analyzing this
27:39 information a tip beat the videos okay
27:45 first of all let's go into a quick legal
27:48 definition of quote/unquote leaking
27:50 leaking means you take classified
27:51 information and you provide it an
27:53 unauthorized manner it goes out to the
27:56 public
27:56 that's a leak that is not the case first
28:01 of all these videos went through a
28:03 proper classification review process the
28:07 documentation at some point will
28:09 probably come out I'm not going to
28:11 provide it that's not my job you want to
28:13 get it from the government they released
28:15 it they released they authorized let me
28:17 let me get this written that may
28:18 authorize the release of those videos
28:22 and they did it in writing
28:24 now why they did it you have to bring it
28:27 up to them I know the purposes that we
28:29 wanted for them to come out and that was
28:31 to establish an unclassified community
28:33 of interests and everybody could be part
28:35 of it look at and say hey I saw
28:37 something like that too but
28:41 knowing leet these videos if that was a
28:44 case I would be in a orange jumpsuit
28:47 right now in it I do not look good in
28:48 orange so believe me I'm okay
28:53 a tip is a ploy for the administration's
28:56 new space force I mean know where to
28:59 begin with that nope
29:03 now could it be used to bolster that
29:06 argument sure okay and the end if it
29:10 helps us go ahead use it I don't care I
29:13 think that's great
29:14 you want to say that that the UAP
29:15 Studies is now helping us create a space
29:18 force so we can go ahead and look at
29:19 this problem seriously sign me up
29:22 sure again here we go into the to to the
29:28 habit of filling in information voids
29:32 with things that we don't know I don't
29:35 know why the administration is creating
29:37 a space force maybe it's a good idea
29:39 maybe it's not such a good idea I don't
29:42 know I think ultimately it's up to
29:44 voters to decide you make the decision
29:47 if it is or not but I will tell you if
29:50 our humble little program a tip helped
29:54 them form that decision and they are
29:56 going to come back and fund this program
29:59 in a robust manner what we're going to
30:01 look at it logically we're going to look
30:02 at it with the best scientists and
30:05 intelligence officers and critically
30:07 really look at this I mean alternative
30:08 analysis healthy skepticism but but of
30:13 course alternative analysis if it's
30:16 gonna help that let's do it sure so
30:24 what's happening now why are we here
30:28 here the conversation has finally moved
30:33 folks from the fringe so congratulations
30:37 you succeeded if you were to ask me
30:40 eight months ago that I'd be standing up
30:41 here to having this conversation and
30:43 reefing you this the way I'd say four
30:47 five years away from you
30:49 getting close to this so lie how things
30:52 have
30:53 so quickly now I understand people are
30:54 impatient I'm impatient my daughter will
30:56 tell you she's right here in the
30:57 audience I'm impatient I don't like to
30:59 wait I want my information now but as
31:01 I've told people before there is a
31:03 difference beginning between giving you
31:08 information right versus giving you
31:11 information right now they're not always
31:14 necessarily the same I'd rather give you
31:17 information right versus right now so it
31:22 is important that we do our due
31:24 diligence it's important that when we
31:25 are looking at the data that we analyze
31:27 it we quantify it we qualify and do all
31:28 the things necessary so by the time you
31:30 present it take a court of law right you
31:32 don't want a chief prosecutor talking to
31:34 the jury with a half-baked case that's a
31:37 dereliction of duty it is incumbent is
31:39 their professional responsibility to
31:41 make sure they get it right and here is
31:43 the data as best as we know it to be as
31:46 of now can we go back with those slides
31:48 real quick ok so don't look now people
31:54 are not having a conversation over the
31:55 dinner table mainstream media has talked
31:57 about this several times they're getting
32:00 it takes a little while but they're
32:03 having a conversation and now all these
32:05 peoples hey we thought you guys were
32:06 crazy maybe you're right
32:08 so we've come a long way a tech focus
32:12 areas remain relevant still to both
32:15 national security and to humanity that's
32:18 why we're here right what's it say here
32:20 I think two future of humanity I'd like
32:24 to talk about that for a minute
32:25 national security well if you have
32:27 something that can fly in and out of
32:28 your airspace undetected you can't stop
32:30 it you don't know how it works
32:31 is that a threat I don't know is it a
32:34 threat the fact that we can't answer
32:36 that we have to presume there's a
32:37 possibility it could be a threat and I
32:40 would submit to you you want us to think
32:43 that way that is national security you
32:46 don't want us assuming that something is
32:48 not a threat without all the data points
32:50 that is not what we pay the Department
32:53 of Defense to do humanity relevant to
33:00 humanity I said this before
33:03 I don't know the impact this has to
33:06 humanity and what we should do about it
33:09 that's a decision you want me to make my
33:12 job simple collect the truth tell the
33:15 truth that's it not hard I mean I just
33:18 didn't think it was hard it's hard but
33:22 really the the big the big the heavy
33:25 lifting here is you all because you're
33:27 the ones that have to tell national
33:29 leadership what you want you're the ones
33:31 that vote you're the ones that that sit
33:34 there and call congressmen and Senators
33:35 and say I want action right so I think I
33:40 think the effects on humanity is is it
33:43 does have effect but but ultimately that
33:45 story is still being written and how
33:47 that story ends is really dependent on
33:49 you t TSA and others are creating the
33:53 environment for elements within the
33:55 executive and legislative branch to have
33:57 the discussion people have asked what
34:00 are you doing while we're doing what we
34:01 can does t TSA have contacts and
34:05 connections probably but I also
34:09 understand the need for privacy I also
34:12 understand and respect the need to give
34:14 people an operational safe space to
34:19 collect information and make an informed
34:20 decision without necessarily unnecessary
34:26 political pressure we have to give
34:29 people trade space time will be
34:33 necessary to allow leadership proper
34:35 awareness and assessment
34:36 you cannot digest a seven-course meal in
34:40 ten minutes folks
34:42 it takes time you've had some of you had
34:46 decades involved in this so what you
34:49 know to be in fact people are just now
34:52 hearing it for the very first time as
34:53 crazy as that may seem it's true for
34:58 some folks the the article that came out
35:00 in the New York Times is the very first
35:02 time they've ever actually even
35:04 considered this topic let alone our
35:07 leadership
35:08 let alone our lawmakers so I think I
35:14 think you are well on the way of getting
35:17 what you're seeking I think we have
35:20 tremendous momentum like never before I
35:22 think the effort with organizations such
35:26 as MUFON now is not the time to throttle
35:29 back now is the time to push the
35:31 throttle all the way for that's what I
35:33 think if you are looking for government
35:38 to give you acknowledgment and just give
35:41 you full disclosure I'll tell you right
35:45 here and now the government's job is not
35:47 to satisfy I don't curiosity that's not
35:51 the function of the government I know we
35:52 want it to be but that's not the case
35:54 the purpose of the government is to
35:57 defend this country from all enemies
35:59 foreign and domestic
36:00 now if there's information out there
36:02 that could be helpful in doing so
36:04 they're gonna be involved and if there's
36:07 information out there that doesn't
36:08 really relate to this to that mission
36:11 but could be helpful to us well that's
36:12 what we get involved that's that's how
36:15 we can help let's go back to there we go
36:24 organizations like T TSA are developing
36:26 initiatives like the community of
36:28 interest data repositories and
36:30 information sharing information sharing
36:33 don't think of it as just being here
36:36 information sharing is international it
36:39 is global as we have seen before there's
36:42 many nations here represented that is
36:45 exactly what we need to continue to do
36:48 both as a society and as a government so
36:56 in my opinion anyways I think getting
37:01 over the finish line if there's really
37:03 such thing as a finish line there might
37:05 not be this might be an enduring effort
37:08 and if you're looking for this
37:09 satisfaction that I can say I made it
37:13 that they may never come maybe it does
37:15 but that may never come maybe the
37:17 satisfaction of knowing that people can
37:19 finally have a conversation at the
37:21 dinner table you can turn on CNN or Fox
37:23 News or BBC or what else and people are
37:26 having conversations with reputable
37:28 experts and they're funding programs to
37:30 look into it
37:31 maybe that's success I mean we all have
37:34 a different definition of what success
37:35 is right ok so last but not least my my
37:47 purpose here was simply to give you a
37:48 broad overview kind of dispel some of
37:50 the myths we could sit here all night
37:52 and talk about a tip I get it and I'm
37:55 happy to do so I don't think Jan whether
37:59 you all would appreciate that but
38:01 there's a lot more to this and I before
38:04 I open this up to questions I want to
38:05 say one last thing I am confident and I
38:09 am cautiously optimistic that in the
38:16 next year we are going to have a
38:17 fundamentally different conversation
38:19 than we're having today I think there's
38:22 going to be additional fidelity to to a
38:26 lot of the things that have come out
38:27 recently that are going to miss Rossum
38:31 that are going to be able to have missed
38:33 out trouble that are going to help us
38:36 have a better understanding of what it
38:39 is we're actually seeing here so with
38:42 that said Jen are you ok if we opened it
38:44 before to discretions my microphone ok
38:53 I said right now sure so I asked Lou he
39:00 could just talk about the role he sees
39:01 MUFON playing in this sure they stone
39:03 what he's doing and then things that are
39:04 go out or go real quick I know we've got
39:07 some questions out there so we'll get to
39:08 you
39:10 what role does MUFON have in this route
39:15 font can do something nobody else can do
39:18 DoD cannot engage the private sector it
39:22 doesn't have a capacity it doesn't have
39:24 the the resources and it damn sure
39:27 doesn't have the mission
39:28 that's not beauty's mission DHS they
39:32 don't either
39:32 FAA a little maybe to some degree but
39:35 not a lot the only ones that can really
39:39 do that is a private organization and
39:41 move on as the track record it has the
39:44 expertise you guys have been around
39:46 since 1969 39:49 I just asked people to look at the
39:51 mission statement of MUFON look at those
39:55 three tiers that's not a DoD mission
39:58 that will never be a team image that
40:00 would never be a government mission
40:01 that's a MUFON mission and that's what
40:04 makes MUFON so special that's why TTS a
40:06 we're not replicating you guys we don't
40:08 want to do what you guys do because
40:09 we'll never be as good as you guys doing
40:11 it we have our own niche but we need to
40:13 work collaboratively and collectively
40:14 together to the common goal this is this
40:16 is a this is a team effort right on I
40:20 hate to use a battle space but let's
40:22 let's talk about baseball in right you
40:24 have a pitcher
40:24 no one can do the job like a pitcher
40:26 like a pitcher but no it can be a first
40:27 baseman like a first baseman and no one
40:29 can be a catcher like to catcher right
40:30 and in the battle space arena no one can
40:33 be a pilot but a pilot none can be a
40:35 soldier but a soldier you know everybody
40:37 has their own roles and responsibilities
40:39 and I think we need to work collectively
40:42 together and continue to push push the
40:46 Neill forward TTS say well never will
40:50 never be in this trade space but it's
40:53 it's this is your trade space this is
40:55 what you're good at
40:56 we'll never be that but we can do other
40:59 things we can be a bridge right we can
41:00 help engage people because of certain
41:03 people's experiences and acts
41:04 that maybe mufon doesn't have resident
41:07 in house so while you're trying to do
41:09 one thing we can come over on this side
41:11 of the field and do something else and
41:13 meet in the endzone thank you okay so
41:18 I've got two things to tell you the
41:20 first is that they're tearing down the
41:22 desserts and the coffee so if you'd like
41:24 to get some now's a time
41:25 the second thing is that we're gonna
41:28 have QA queued up here so if you want to
41:30 ask a question the line up here this way
41:33 and that gentleman with the black shirt
41:34 has been having his hand up I'd like to
41:36 give an opportunity to go first okay
41:39 right there okay and I'm gonna turn the
41:42 mic over to Skye and she's gonna hand oh
41:44 my gosh hold for you so here go the
41:46 questions if you have tomatoes please
41:49 I'm wearing a dark suit don't throw the
41:53 money
42:00 when John Podesta left the Obama White
42:03 House he held a press conference and at
42:07 that conference he said his saddest
42:09 moment public service was his inability
42:12 to get to the bottom of the UFO
42:16 phenomena my question to you is did
42:20 Podesta ever reach out to you attempt to
42:22 make contact and if he made contact
42:25 because of his security clearance were
42:27 you able to tell him things that you are
42:30 not able to tell us sir out of respect
42:33 for mr. John Podesta you'd have to
42:36 reserve that question for him I do not
42:38 have the right to speak that's that's a
42:42 two-part question and I would not feel
42:44 right about even addressing that without
42:47 him being in the room and addressing
42:50 that question you have a problem did you
42:53 ever talk to him again that's a question
42:55 you'd have fast mr. chocolate yes sir
43:02 yes
43:04 hi I want to first of all as I think you
43:11 mentioned to us that and please tell me
43:14 if I'm incorrect about this but that
43:16 you're a program was actually using
43:18 MUFON files right you were looking at
43:21 our files and and using that as part of
43:23 your data to look at in terms of the
43:28 behavior of these craft the
43:31 physiological effects they have on
43:32 people as they approach them was that is
43:34 that a cure so as a title 10 43:39 organization we're supposed to focus on
43:41 DoD centric things but it is a true
43:50 statement that information from
43:53 expertise from all sorts of places often
43:56 made it across our desks because with
44:00 limited keep in mind with limited
44:01 resources you don't want to spend it
44:03 reinventing the wheel right so if you
44:05 have credible data you have credible
44:07 datasets and you can use that cooperates
44:11 other data points then we'd want to use
44:14 it right so I can't specifically say
44:19 something that would inadvertently
44:21 endorse one organization and its
44:24 relevance to national security but what
44:26 I can tell you is that that we would
44:30 want to look at things holistically and
44:32 the more data points that came in the
44:34 better and what I can't say that MUFON
44:38 has a wonderful reputation of of doing
44:41 good and solid investigative work that I
44:44 can say I just have one little comment
44:47 and a follow-up question and you may
44:50 want to think about it for a second but
44:52 everything that you've told us tonight
44:54 are things that we figured out 50 years
44:56 ago and we've been and we've known all
44:58 these things especially in terms of the
45:00 five observables related to how these
45:03 crafts behave and so forth and so
45:06 clearly right now today as we stand here
45:09 in this room all these people have
45:10 dedicated their lives to the study of
45:12 this for for a reason
45:14 one of the reasons that we've done it is
45:17 so that we could have some kind of
45:19 validation for regarding the things that
45:22 we know and now we even have this
45:24 through the a chat program it is
45:26 acknowledged that these objects exist
45:28 and you had mentioned that you never
45:31 touched on the questions of who's behind
45:33 the wheel and you know that that kind of
45:37 thing and what are their intentions and
45:39 so you know we can spend another 50 45:42 years saying well that object was read
45:44 and it did this but why we know that
45:48 these objects are real and so my
45:50 question to you is what is truly the
45:53 next step are we not talking about
45:54 Exopolitics well what we haven't
45:57 discussed yet is the fact that's not
45:59 just we know what the observables are we
46:01 now know the physics for the first time
46:03 we have the mathematical formulas with
46:05 the scientific modeling with the
46:07 observations of eyewitnesses with
46:09 electro-optical data with the
46:10 electromechanical data such as radio
46:12 returns all saying the same thing and
46:15 it's not just speculation now we
46:18 actually have models the physics we
46:23 understand at the quantum level how that
46:27 works and that is something that if
46:29 people in this room figured out 50 years
46:31 ago congratulations because we're a lot
46:33 slower than you but that for me is
46:36 what's so exciting so again my path my
46:38 mission of how it works that was I think
46:43 the accomplishment the contribution of a
46:45 tip is that we did get the best minds to
46:49 figure out the mathematics and law of
46:52 modeling to say this isn't a thousand
46:54 years in the future this may not even be
46:57 a hundred years in the future this might
46:58 just be 25 years in the future I mean we
47:01 a lot of us in this room maybe around to
47:03 actually begin to enjoy and exploit some
47:06 of this technology I mean that's
47:08 profound so I apologize again the
47:16 question would be you know you said you
47:19 purposely didn't look at all right who's
47:21 behind the wheel and so but you do have
47:23 a personal opinion how about
47:25 right of course have a personal opinion
47:27 but you know what they say about
47:27 opinions I I guess the question is and I
47:31 guess I would just leave it open who's
47:33 behind the wheel and what are their
47:35 trade questions and that's for move on
47:37 to help answer I sir how are you great
47:46 great
47:48 I don't get it considering that there
47:50 are sufficient checks and balances in
47:52 the government that among them is I
47:55 can't afford a 1:30 flight to 6 section
47:57 one point seven and one three five two
47:59 six three point one which I only say you
48:02 can't classify things until I'm doing
48:03 and you gotta classify something if it's
48:05 in the I think lies by something it's in
48:07 the public interest which other powers
48:08 national security at all times well I
48:10 want you use that to justify exercising
48:12 your right to go against your oath the
48:15 classify that stuff and use that those
48:17 checks balances in court to define
48:18 yourself if they decide to come after
48:20 you like they do the other
48:20 whistleblowers so great question because
48:23 I have unfortunately executive order one
48:25 two nine five eight and checking order
48:26 one two triple three that I have to
48:27 abide by plus DOD directive 52 49 152 48:30 40.1 are and the whole host of other
48:33 fifty to five series sorry yes sir I
48:47 want you to come in our to answer it's
48:50 about an infant that the place not
48:53 returned Montreal in Quebec and someone
48:58 a witness not only just saw a triangular
49:01 UFO before he took a picture of it and
49:03 then the next morning he called the army
49:06 and the army was asking him whatever you
49:11 took with your mm-hmm have you took a
49:14 picture of it he said yes with what and
49:16 he said with the iPhone 4 and they asked
49:20 him a lot of questions and after that he
49:24 couldn't access is phony and
49:28 and after he could access his phone the
49:32 photo was still there but blurry all
49:35 blurry and this this photo was nice
49:38 enough
49:39 get in the local newspaper even under
49:42 larger scale newspaper but I want your
49:45 comments I don't have one for Canada you
49:51 know I I would take that up with with
49:53 the Canadian government NORAD was
49:56 involved also
49:57 so NORAD is Canadian the newest I'm
50:00 sorry the lor at NORAD well I I can't
50:03 speculate if Nora was involved or not I
50:05 I don't have any evidence of that you
50:08 know I think it would be unusual for for
50:15 NORAD to be involved in something like
50:17 that I'm not saying that it's impossible
50:19 but that's not really within the mission
50:22 scope of it what I would encourage
50:24 anybody to do when we hear information
50:26 that's hearsay it's really important we
50:29 actually have and I'm not saying this is
50:32 not the case it could be the case but in
50:33 general we can't just take things at
50:36 face value that's what makes this job so
50:39 difficult because there's a lot of good
50:40 people with good intentions I see a lot
50:42 of things and even with their own pilots
50:45 I've got to had the data to back it up
50:47 and so if somebody is coming into a
50:50 phone and surreptitiously doing
50:52 something to modify a picture in the
50:57 United States that requires legal
50:59 authorities that are well beyond
51:02 anything that NORAD would be able to
51:03 throw out of their hip pocket and just
51:05 do I mean you you're going into a
51:08 private citizens phone so I would be
51:12 interested to see some of the data maybe
51:15 some of the algorithms or the the
51:17 heuristics to see was NORAD really
51:20 involved I'd be very surprised if they
51:21 really were again I'm not defending all
51:23 right I don't really know if they did or
51:24 didn't but that would be really unusual
51:27 unless there was some sort of foreign
51:29 intelligence connection and it wasn't
51:31 really a picture of a triangle it was a
51:34 picture of something else very very
51:36 significant but again that's pure
51:38 speculation on my part and I don't know
51:41 to be honest with you but I do know that
51:42 things happen in Canada that are pretty
51:44 interesting so in one word said it's
51:49 illegal
51:52 it is it is unusual sorry I know I'm not
52:01 being helpful sorry I could you
52:07 elaborate your role at TTS 8 now and
52:10 what what you expect them to do in the
52:13 future specifically in terms of control
52:16 over sure so my role in TTS a well it's
52:19 supposed to be the security guy
52:21 because that's kind of my background for
52:24 those of you who don't know it's been a
52:25 bit of time a lot of time encounter
52:27 telogen security I was a special agent
52:29 in charge at one point in my career
52:32 focus primarily on counterterrorism and
52:35 an espionage type stuff as far as my
52:40 role in TTS a it's supposed to be that
52:42 unfortunately I find myself spending a
52:44 lot of my time actually well doing a lot
52:48 of kind of the same stuff I was doing in
52:50 a tip that is collecting data wherever
52:55 that is whatever whatever that may look
52:57 like and being able to analyze it and
53:00 then deliver that information to other
53:03 members of our team people like how put
53:05 off Steve justice from from Lockheed
53:07 skunkworks who have the scientific
53:10 expertise necessary to look at this
53:13 stuff and make a determination is it
53:16 from here is it man-made or is it
53:20 something else as far as the overall
53:22 role of T TSA I think I briefly covered
53:26 that but probably not good enough
53:28 think of T TSA right now as a as a
53:34 start-up I'd love to say aerospace
53:36 company but I'm not quite sure actually
53:38 aerospace yet but we're getting close a
53:41 small startup company that wants to
53:47 collect the truth to speak the truth and
53:49 maybe enabling capability of bridging
53:53 capability between the government and
53:55 the private sector and academia we have
53:59 several portfolios we have a scientific
54:01 portfolio we have a field operations
54:03 portfolio of an entertainment portfolio
54:05 people say entertain portfolio why do
54:06 you have entertainment portfolio because
54:08 storytelling is as natural as mankind
54:11 itself ever since man was living in case
54:14 we have been telling our story on the
54:18 walls
54:19 whether it is biblical stories or
54:23 stories of mankind sailing the ocean
54:26 blue we've always told storage can you
54:29 imagine for just a moment
54:31 being a reporter on the deck of one of
54:35 those ships for the very first time that
54:37 was going to sail over the horizon to
54:40 somewhere new were you going to fall off
54:43 the edge of the earth are there sea
54:46 monsters right all these things that are
54:47 going when you'd love to capture that
54:49 first voyage well in entertainment
54:52 that's kind of what we want to do
54:54 there's a little bit of storytelling
54:55 there and we want to try to record this
54:57 and and you know because this in the end
55:01 this is story about all of us so that's
55:03 what the entertainment divisions doing
55:15 presentation yes sir
55:17 um as a as a professional physicist
55:20 interested in interstellar travel I'm
55:22 wondering if you can tell us anything
55:23 about the physics of these objects or
55:26 the hypotheses that are on the table
55:29 yeah there's a lot first and foremost I
55:32 think there's a misnomer people think
55:34 you have to break the laws of physics oh
55:36 that something's going faster than light
55:37 nobody said that
55:38 nobody's saying something's going faster
55:40 than light what we're talking about is
55:43 warping space-time now people say well
55:44 that's you know do do science look it is
55:47 a fact folks I I don't know what to tell
55:50 you the fact that we're on this planet
55:52 space-time is being warped because you
55:54 have a massive object floating in space
55:56 and the nearer or closer you are to a
55:59 massive object in space the greater
56:01 space-time is warped that is the reason
56:04 why the GPS satellites that we use you
56:06 sure you know this er that are up above
56:08 us with the exact same cesium atomic
56:10 clock as we have here on the ground
56:12 station operate and those close you have
56:14 a something called atomic clock drift
56:16 that is because the space time being
56:19 experienced further away from the earth
56:21 is fundamentally different
56:24 Einstein proved it might say theorized
56:25 and then of course Hawking's further
56:27 expanded upon it but that's a scientific
56:29 fact we see it every day you see with
56:31 gravitational lensing when we're talking
56:33 about large or two clusters of galaxies
56:36 if you were standing on the surface of
56:38 the Sun if you could withstand it time
56:41 would go by fundamentally different than
56:42 they do here on earth if you go by a
56:44 black hole time goes even it goes even
56:46 crazier so we know mother nature already
56:49 warp space-time it's not a question of
56:51 if it's a fact so the question is is it
56:55 theoretically possible to warp
56:57 space-time in which space-time can be
57:01 compressed there's a shortcut is there a
57:05 way to in essence ride the wave tops of
57:08 that space-time so what appears to me as
57:13 is crazy sudden acceleration hypersonic
57:17 velocities and low observability and
57:18 anti-gravity is really a function of you
57:21 being able to insulate yourself in
57:24 theory from the natural effects of
57:25 Earth's gravitational
57:26 force and by the way to resist
57:28 gravitational force the net effect would
57:30 be not only you just floating not having
57:32 to have wings or thrust or rockets or an
57:35 engine or even wings but time itself
57:39 would be fundamentally experienced
57:41 differently from you inside that bubble
57:44 than the rest of us outside that bubble
57:46 even though we're all living the same
57:47 three-dimensional space so in a nutshell
57:51 without going into a whole lot of
57:52 physics here that was probably well
57:53 above me we have we have now some
57:57 mathematical models and the scientific
57:59 modeling from really good physicists
58:01 we've actually now been able to
58:03 replicate at the micro level the warping
58:04 of space-time at the Large Hadron
58:06 Collider in the CERN don't look now but
58:08 do you remember it when three years ago
58:09 scientists were saying we are now
58:10 creating micro black holes and people
58:13 said oh my gosh you're going to suck the
58:14 world in Simon's gonna get so that's not
58:16 what they were saying what they were
58:18 saying is we have now created energy
58:20 levels high enough where we are
58:22 beginning to warp space-time in a
58:25 laboratory and that's what that means
58:28 and so the question is if we can do it
58:31 that's not a question when we've done it
58:33 already we've been doing it for three
58:34 years the real question is a
58:36 technological question it's a
58:38 scalability question that's the question
58:41 so whether it is or isn't that's not up
58:43 for argue many more it is the question
58:45 is how thank you yes sir hello sirs
58:54 great meeting you earlier today oh sure
58:56 sure and thank you as my thank you again
58:58 for your service you continued service
59:00 sir a mid-sized corporation anywhere in
59:03 America with an enterprise level IT
59:06 infrastructure and a campus-wide desktop
59:09 support would have a budget well in
59:13 excess of twenty two million dollars
59:15 just for that aspect of their operation
59:18 if you were able to do what the slides
59:21 say for twenty two million dollars it's
59:23 the gold standard in spending tax
59:25 dollars in the US and I'd like to
59:28 understand or have you explain how did
59:31 you make that money twenty two million
59:32 dollars stretch what was it really spent
59:34 on is there money in the missing
59:37 Pentagon trillions of dollars that were
59:39 funneled into this up
59:40 raishin sure and how can we get the rest
59:44 of the government to operate as
59:45 efficiently as yours did well well thank
59:54 you for that good that compliment I
59:56 think so there's an old saying we have
59:59 in the Department of Defense what do you
60:03 call a vision a company vision or
60:07 organizational vision without a budget
60:09 it's a hallucination so in this
60:13 particular case you're right 22 million
60:16 dollars by summits considered budget
60:17 dust but by others it's considered a
60:22 healthy start and it's a proof of
60:25 concept it's a prototype and so you do
60:27 what you can and you do will use the
60:29 hell out of everything you can what do I
60:31 mean by that that means you get as many
60:34 friends as you possibly can that are a
60:35 lot that are that have an allegiance to
60:37 your mission and use them to the
60:41 greatest extent possible
60:42 it also means leveraging academia areas
60:46 that you can for free if you can because
60:50 students are always looking for some
60:52 sort of graduate level program to work
60:54 on project thesis
60:57 it also means managing your money really
61:01 really carefully I a blue-collar guy you
61:07 know if I owned the construction I was a
61:09 mechanic anything that could to get by
61:10 and pay my with your college join the
61:12 army I know what it's like to live 50 I
61:19 apply that same philosophy at work I
61:23 didn't consider anything budget dust
61:26 even though a lot of my folks had much
61:28 bigger budget than me I looked at as an
61:31 honor and a privilege by the American
61:32 people your heart texts I would submit
61:34 to you that if you had that 22 million
61:35 dollars in your pocket right now as an
61:37 individual you probably be pretty happy
61:39 if you do a lot of things with it so it
61:41 was incumbent upon the organization I
61:44 was with the staff I was working with
61:45 and myself that we spent every single
61:48 penny in a way that gave us the most
61:51 bang for our buck we didn't just go out
61:53 say
61:54 yeah that seems like a good idea we
61:56 would sit there and roundtable the hell
61:57 out of things and try to figure out is
61:59 this the best way to spend our resources
62:02 look look at MUFON right now you've got
62:04 a lot of people sitting in this room
62:06 right now and you're surviving off
62:09 things like memberships and get people
62:11 interested and I bet t-shirts and hats
62:13 as a form of survival well to some
62:17 degree were kind of the same way we had
62:20 to make sure every dollar was stretched
62:23 as far as we possibly could stretch it
62:25 and 22 million dollars may not seem like
62:27 a lot to some organizations but it was
62:31 for us and keep in mind DoD's an
62:33 organization that's omnipresent we are
62:35 global so it's easy to be in the world's
62:38 largest company and send down a
62:41 lightning bolt and say I want that
62:42 person to be in that place at that time
62:45 use that airplane which I want to pay
62:47 for and I want you to collect that
62:48 information report back to me that
62:51 doesn't cost me anything i cost jet fuel
62:54 but didn't cost me anything so there's a
62:58 lot of ways to do it I think you know
63:00 Lean Six Sigma I don't want to go into
63:02 corporate strategic you know way of
63:07 doing business but we did adopt a lot of
63:08 that you know we obviously you have
63:10 milestones and benchmarks you have
63:11 mission objectives enterprise objectives
63:14 and you try to stick to those as much as
63:15 possible and make sure all that alive
63:17 you don't do anything an organization
63:19 that's not aligned to your ultimate
63:20 mission in your vision if it's not
63:22 helping the mission not wasting my time
63:24 or money on it so thanks
63:32 sure
63:34 I don't I don't really have a question I
63:36 just want to say maybe huge thank you on
63:39 behalf probably I don't know the number
63:43 but but everyday internet to for better
63:50 come read it on YouTube on twitch that
63:53 they're flocking to you in the fight to
63:55 to stars and so for as much slack as you
63:58 take I want you to know there's a huge
64:01 population of people internationally I
64:05 talk to friends Russia and Spain never
64:07 else they are not just behind you but
64:10 they're like people were behind John
64:13 Connor
64:13 that's gosh well I appreciate that but I
64:15 you know there's gonna be times I'm
64:17 gonna say stupid things I say them all
64:19 the time just ask my girls I mean I've
64:21 been but my commitment to you I'll
64:24 always speak the truth
64:25 you may not like it and I may not have
64:29 all the answers I certainly don't in
64:30 fact like I said before I have a lot
64:32 more questions I have answers but I'll
64:34 always tell you the truth I don't have
64:36 an agenda I don't have a cottage
64:38 industry I'm not being paid to be here
64:40 I'm not here trying to push my belief
64:43 system on anybody I'm not creating a
64:46 dollar by YouTube views I am I'm simply
64:53 here because you asked me to be so in
64:57 here and all you have to tell me is you
65:01 don't want me to be here I won't be here
65:02 but thank you very much for the
65:04 compliment
65:11 [Applause]
65:15 so I have two questions my first
65:17 question is why 2007 what happened in
65:20 2007 to make the that led to the
65:23 Senators to decide to create this
65:25 program my second question is what's
65:27 your personal view on Roswell do you
65:30 think it was project mogul or or it was
65:32 a really an alien space crash if so
65:35 where are the bodies let's start with
65:38 the 2007 I can't speculate because
65:41 that's a question I think would be a
65:43 great question to ask Senator Reid
65:44 unfortunately Senator Reid right now has
65:46 got some health issues obviously pray
65:49 for a quick recovery for him but I would
65:53 talk to him because I could speculate
65:55 here all night of what I think he might
65:57 be thinking but he could probably tell
66:00 you a whole lot better than I can what
66:01 he was actually thinking I suspect that
66:04 they had enough information critical
66:07 mass if you will to come to the
66:09 determination that this was worth
66:11 looking into I suspect it may have been
66:14 even from information that MUFON
66:16 developed wouldn't that be something
66:20 okay now as far as the next question you
66:24 had I don't want to forget that Roswell
66:28 I wasn't around for Roswell but I might
66:33 look I know this is look this is blonde
66:35 that gray so I'm not that old but
66:39 obviously to every rumor there's a grain
66:43 of truth obviously something happened
66:45 obviously the military was engaged they
66:46 admitted they were obviously there were
66:49 civilians engaged because they
66:51 acknowledged it so something happened
66:54 something happened given what the report
66:58 says there was a crash something crashed
67:00 in the desert in Roswell and the
67:02 military was involved that's correct
67:04 true true true true true the real
67:08 question is what was it and in order to
67:13 answer that question if absent of the
67:15 information we'd have to build the case
67:17 we would have to go through all the data
67:20 to figure out what was the response by
67:22 the military was that we
67:25 it's typical for a crash like that if it
67:30 was a balloon indeed a balloon would you
67:32 have a response like that would they
67:34 have surrounded the area kept it quiet
67:37 trucked everything away
67:38 where did they truck it to who is in
67:40 charge who is a commanding officer who
67:42 is the executive officer all those type
67:44 of things you want to ask well that the
67:46 vehicles that you use believe it or not
67:47 in intelligence you can you can make you
67:49 can determine a lot of things by looking
67:51 at signatures so did they bring in army
67:54 jeeps or the debris in flatbeds because
67:56 I'll tell you how mylar balloon doesn't
67:57 need a flatbed so these are the
68:00 questions that one would want to ask
68:01 right what was the senior ranking
68:04 officer on site was a staff sergeant was
68:07 it a major was it a colonel right so
68:12 those are all the questions as an
68:13 investigator I'm certainly going to want
68:15 to ask and that will help me in absence
68:18 of the actual physical evidence to begin
68:20 to put pieces of the puzzle together so
68:22 I know I'm not answering your question
68:24 to be truly honest with you I don't know
68:38 hi um can you talk about what you
68:40 dropped off with help cutoff do you have
68:43 biological material do you have metal
68:45 material can you talk about that what
68:48 like working it's hot in here as I
68:56 mentioned before we are we are involved
69:00 and a whole swath of things cast a wide
69:04 net catch as many fish as you can so if
69:08 as an organization if there was material
69:11 that was being offered to us yeah we're
69:15 gonna collect it yeah we're gonna
69:16 analyze it in fact when you analyze
69:18 something people say I'm gonna hand you
69:21 this analyze well it's not that easy
69:25 okay first thing you do is you document
69:28 it you photograph it you isolate it you
69:32 protect it and then you ship it off and
69:34 when it goes for analysis you're gonna
69:37 look at you're gonna start big and work
69:39 your way small the first thing you're
69:40 gonna do is look at this object you're
69:41 gonna say what color is it what shape is
69:43 it how much does a way is it shiny is it
69:46 opaque is it metallic as a plastic is it
69:48 organic right all these things you can
69:50 look at its physical properties then
69:51 you're gonna look at it outside and say
69:53 is there heat ablation is there material
69:55 vitrification as a result of overheating
69:58 to what temperatures would cause that
69:59 then you're gonna look at you're gonna
70:01 say how about electro conductivity
70:03 does it conduct electricity is there
70:05 electromagnetic frequencies involved
70:06 this is it EMF is a potentially
70:08 radioactive all these things you would
70:10 look at in a physical sense then once
70:13 you begin to look at this thing and say
70:14 yes this this is this is unique then
70:20 you're gonna go into more detail
70:22 analysis now we're going to go from a
70:23 physical analysis to a chemical and
70:25 molecular level analysis we're going to
70:28 look at the chemical compositions the
70:29 relationships one molecule has with
70:32 another are there any nuances associated
70:35 with that relationship for example
70:37 anything unique that these two materials
70:41 why would you put these two materials
70:42 together you can look at the actual
70:45 molecular matrices involved that could
70:49 concert the way they are bonded together
70:52 right for those physical properties then
70:56 depending on that if you find some
70:58 unique stuff like let's say your idiom
71:00 by the way pretty important because
71:03 that's not really here in large
71:05 qualities naturally so if you have a
71:07 sample that's got a lot of iridium
71:08 chance darts than that from here you're
71:11 gonna look at maybe there's strontium
71:14 involved uranium and maybe a unique type
71:17 of uranium involved if you find some
71:19 anomalies and then you're gonna go one
71:20 step deeper and you're gonna look at the
71:22 atomic analysis this is where you're
71:25 looking at isotopic ratios individual
71:27 atoms themselves and you're gonna look
71:29 is there anything unique about that that
71:33 ion that isotope meaning when you have
71:38 an electron fall into the nucleus of an
71:40 atom and it's and it becomes one with a
71:44 proton it becomes a neutron and that
71:47 occurs naturally percentages of ions
71:51 occur naturally in mother nature we see
71:53 it all the time and we actually engineer
71:54 ourselves isotopes for very specific
71:57 purposes but there are some isotopic
72:00 structures that are so unique that they
72:05 would be almost impossible to engineer
72:07 and if you did it would cost you
72:09 billions of dollars so what do I mean
72:11 with that let's let me give you a very
72:12 quick analogy because I think it's a
72:13 very important question last if I want
72:16 to make a ball of uranium 238 okay I
72:19 can't go into specifics but just let's
72:21 say I'll go baseball worth of uranium
72:23 238 it's gonna cost me billions and
72:27 billions of dollars to do that you say
72:28 well why is that blue I mean it's not
72:30 that much material because first of all
72:32 it takes tremendous centrifuges and
72:35 technology to enrich uranium it's going
72:39 to take a trainload with infrastructure
72:42 of uranium-235 to be able for me to get
72:45 to the amount of uranium that I'm
72:46 looking for
72:47 it's going to take a small city worth of
72:49 in stress structure in order to generate
72:51 the power requirements just to feed the
72:54 electronic equipment and the centrifuges
72:56 to create them at here so my point is to
72:58 create a little piece this much we know
73:00 it will cost country X
73:02 surrounded billions of dollars so you
73:05 can look at that as a calculus when you
73:07 see something truly exotic and you say
73:09 to yourself what would it cost us in
73:12 terms of today's money to create just
73:15 that small sample and that's gonna then
73:18 allow you to know what countries out
73:20 there had that capabilities only certain
73:21 countries that can afford it and even
73:23 had the technological expertise and the
73:25 infrastructure and the wherewithal to
73:26 even create that relationship so
73:29 material can tell you a lot again the
73:32 truth she likes to whisper so you really
73:34 have to listen sometimes and that's what
73:36 we try to do within TTS a look at it in
73:39 a way where we're where we can start to
73:43 figure things out applying some of the
73:44 techniques we have in intelligence and
73:46 military and law enforcement
73:47 investigative type techniques that allow
73:50 us to to to look at this piece of
73:52 material logically because in the end
73:55 some position doesn't really help any of
73:56 us you know you know what assuming does
73:59 right there's an old saying about what
74:00 what happens when you assume right so we
74:03 try not to assume
74:12 Louis thank you very much for being here
74:14 and speak to us and just for sending
74:16 sending your information my question is
74:19 this
74:19 you mentioned earlier that in the short
74:22 short term about a year from now perhaps
74:25 we'll be having a fundamentally
74:27 different conversation based on data
74:31 models etc that that has been that have
74:33 been developed collected and developed
74:35 okay earlier in your presentation you
74:39 mentioned on the slide
74:42 you mentioned national national security
74:47 and and humanity in in the in the same
74:51 sentence I know okay so can you speak a
74:55 bit about
74:56 let me ask let me digress so the maybe
74:59 you collect that has been collected and
75:01 the models developed which is which is
75:03 incredible very promising how does that
75:09 well those things be applied from
75:12 national security and or for the good of
75:14 humanity or towards at some point I
75:17 understand national security is
75:18 paramount I can appreciate that thank
75:20 you for your service um how what do you
75:25 see that that information going in the
75:28 people like well I I think fundamentally
75:32 national security can be symbiotic with
75:34 humanity I think if National Security
75:37 done correctly and oftentimes it is most
75:41 of the time it is it is for Humanity if
75:44 it's good for us and we do it in a
75:48 responsible manner hopefully it's good
75:49 for what's good for the geese is good
75:51 for the flock hopefully where is it
75:54 going to go in the future boy that's a
75:58 tough question you know there's always
76:00 there's always this duality thing we
76:02 deal with right so with every good thing
76:03 we invent you invent nuclear power I
76:07 invent the nuclear bomb you invent the
76:10 airplane I invent the bomber right so
76:14 that is just the way we are and we do it
76:17 because unfortunately we're human beings
76:20 and we'd like to fight each other and we
76:21 like to go to war
76:23 will this be a paradigm shift for the
76:26 sake of humanity and maybe allow us to
76:30 maybe get our heads out of the sand a
76:31 little bit and start focusing somewhere
76:34 else instead of at each other boy that'd
76:36 be great I'd be great but frankly that
76:38 that's not up to me is frankly up to a
76:40 lot of folks down here it's up to the
76:42 next generation I saw a lot of young
76:43 folks in this audience earlier and I
76:46 will tell you you're the ones who are
76:48 going to make that decision how this
76:50 applies to humanity
76:51 you're the ones I got to carry the torch
76:53 that we failed to bring to the finish
76:56 line so really that question you have
77:00 that's really a question for the next
77:02 generation how is this going to apply
77:05 and this is why Emily's encouraged to
77:06 see the next generation you know in our
77:08 generation we had this conversation
77:09 people who think you're certifiably
77:11 insane
77:11 you have the conversation with my
77:13 daughter's friends and their generation
77:16 they look at you and they'll imitate
77:18 though we already know what I mean you
77:20 ready now yeah dad you know it's common
77:23 knowledge with my generation so I think
77:25 there's there's there's a I think
77:29 there's a generation gap and I think to
77:31 some degree they have a much better
77:33 appreciation understanding and
77:35 acceptance of what we have all been
77:37 working so hard for so long
77:48 thank you free to wear it fascinating
77:50 information you're getting yours I'm
77:53 hearing a lot of good things that could
77:55 possibly come out of this on the
77:57 findings I hate to be the dooming little
78:00 guy but I got to ask the question
78:01 trigger what if this is something that
78:05 can go wrong these abilities that you
78:10 seem to be capturing here the potential
78:13 for these abilities and seem to be
78:15 outside our normal physics if this is
78:18 something that we would have to defend
78:22 ourselves against what's worst-case
78:24 scenario well I love it I follow I would
78:27 tell you already is too late because
78:29 it's here so we have a choice we can
78:31 live with our heads buried in the sand
78:33 and hope it goes away
78:34 or we can take our head out of the sand
78:35 and try to figure out how it works
78:37 but whether we choose to accept or not
78:39 it doesn't care it doesn't really care
78:42 what we think in this room because it's
78:43 here so whether or not we choose to
78:47 accept it
78:48 well I don't know what to tell you I
78:50 mean if you I mean no offense anybody
78:53 but if you really think the earth is
78:55 flat I I don't know what to tell you you
78:58 know in this particular case it's here
79:04 so I think this is not like a discussion
79:07 of fine wine this conversation doesn't
79:10 get better the longer we don't talk
79:11 about it right the longer it ages not a
79:13 good idea
79:14 in fact we shouldn't had this
79:15 conversation twenty years ago thirty
79:17 years ago and we should have been a
79:19 little bit more open about it so we
79:21 wouldn't be where we are here today
79:23 that's just my perspective yes sir
79:33 I appreciate your describing how you go
79:39 about analyzing physical evidence on a
79:44 more personal basis can you tell us
79:47 about materials that you saw that you an
79:52 told touched smelled whatever I don't
79:58 think I cannot talk about specifically
80:05 what I may have had access to while
80:07 working in the government I am no longer
80:08 employed with the United States
80:09 government therefore I'm not at liberty
80:11 to discuss inherently government
80:13 business that could potentially love
80:15 classified information and I wouldn't
80:18 want even presume that that I can have
80:21 that conversation so I will politely
80:24 deflect that because I can't tell you
80:28 what I may have physically seen or
80:32 touched or did what I can tell you is I
80:34 would not be wasting my time now putting
80:37 so much effort into this if I didn't
80:39 feel there was a compelling reason that
80:42 we shouldn't be looking into it
80:44 unfortunately about as far as I'm
80:46 prepared to go on that right now thank
80:50 you sir
80:59 yeah little bit of a long set up on this
81:01 question okay but a friend of mine who I
81:05 trust very much that I've known for
81:06 maybe 25 years who has been involved in
81:11 a lot of technical areas and is really
81:12 ingenious he turned me on to this book
81:15 and he said I can verify some of what
81:18 this book covers and I'm very impressed
81:20 by this bizarre reality the book was by
81:23 Dan Sherman called above black it talks
81:26 about project preserved destiny and the
81:29 premise of the book is a guy in the army
81:32 ordinary guy goes to another base for
81:35 training during the day and then he's
81:37 told he's going to have special training
81:38 in the evening long story short he's
81:42 told I can only tell you a couple
81:44 sentences the next contact you have will
81:48 tell you more but your mother was an
81:50 abductee you have been given special
81:54 abilities the government wants to
81:57 exploit those abilities you'll be
81:59 trained and basically you will have to
82:02 be able to receive messages from aliens
82:05 telepathically you will be trained for
82:08 this possibility because there come a
82:11 time what we will have no ordinary
82:14 communication there will be a
82:16 catastrophe I'm really summarizing the
82:19 book because this is you know need to
82:21 know everybody just tells them one
82:22 paragraph and he's like what the hell
82:24 eventually he gets out of it because
82:26 he's he's too weirded out by it but he
82:28 does receive messages and he does
82:29 participate in the program for some time
82:31 and it's very hard for him to get out of
82:34 the program but he's able to do so are
82:36 you familiar with the book are you
82:38 familiar with that premise can you speak
82:41 to that at all that it's a possibility
82:43 what can you say ma'am I'm not familiar
82:46 with the book nor am i familiar with
82:49 with that activity you know again I'm
82:54 not up here to disagree with anybody's
82:58 feelings experiences beliefs I think
83:01 those things are sacred to each and the
83:02 end of every individual but if you ask
83:06 me my experience which I believe is what
83:08 you're asking me I can tell you that I
83:11 am unaware
83:12 that's right
83:22 and I don't server good sir how are you
83:25 know I'm a u.s. Navy veteran I start on
83:28 the USS Iowa mighty thank you by the way
83:31 profile I just really have the most
83:35 simplest question to actually which
83:37 usually is just a yes or no from where
83:41 you're at where you are at in the
83:43 government position is there
83:45 extraterrestrials here on earth right
83:47 now suggest local question it's not a
83:50 yes or no question unfortunately it'd be
83:52 disingenuous for me to answer it that
83:53 way you know if you talk to some medical
83:57 doctors right now they will tell you
83:59 this conclusive evidence that viruses
84:01 are not from this planet
84:02 they came from somewhere else and if you
84:04 look at it from a microbiology
84:05 perspective once you make the argument
84:07 because it's a pet DNA it only has RNA
84:09 that it's very possible that these
84:11 things I mean they might not be from
84:12 here I don't know
84:13 uh-huh what's your extra trace no I
84:16 simply got but what my point being is
84:19 that that's a question that that the
84:24 answer to that is very subjective
84:28 because the bottom line is it doesn't
84:30 matter what I think I've told the folks
84:32 before there's kind of a little little
84:35 little rule we have in intelligence
84:36 don't tell people what you believe
84:38 because time and time again we're human
84:42 beings and I can be absolutely certain
84:44 or something and I can also be
84:46 absolutely wrong and we have seen that
84:49 over and over again and so for me to
84:51 tell you my personal feeling and just a
84:53 simple yes or no would be disingenuous
84:56 because in the end it's not a yes or no
85:00 answer it's really not i know people
85:03 wanted to think it that way but it's not
85:05 you know we could argue till the cows
85:09 come home about possibility of alien
85:12 life and whether it's here whether it's
85:15 been here whether it's going to be here
85:18 in the end we have to we have to let the
85:22 data speak for itself and until I have
85:25 data that I can present to you to say
85:28 here you go which by the way I'm not
85:31 saying we don't I'm just saying these
85:33 things take time
85:34 these things take time
85:36 and I'm not gonna formulate my opinion
85:37 prematurely have I seen weird things
85:40 damn right I have I seem very kind how
85:43 many things ballsy right and so so you
85:46 know I'd love to tell you one way or the
85:48 other but but I'm not prepared to do it
85:51 until I have all the facts believe me
85:55 you don't want me to do it I think it's
85:57 it's that's a temptation I'd I know it
86:01 seems like a great belief is not bliss
86:03 on that you're true or not I'm just
86:04 saying just in what you're saying I
86:11 really do and I can appreciate it but it
86:13 would be it would be irresponsible for
86:15 me to tell you what I think
86:19 during my position because we need more
86:23 facts and once we have those facts I'll
86:26 be the first one to tell you what I
86:28 think but we are not dead yet so yes sir
86:37 I'm sorry Lou I have one more question
86:40 I'm gonna come back down to earth you
86:42 know Gemini like long walks on the beach
86:47 let's let's leave your your military
86:49 stuff let's talk about TNT TSM okay okay
86:52 so I love these little breadcrumbs that
86:55 you leave because I drop them on the
86:57 ground and I eat them up like a sandwich
86:59 so what I'm gonna ask you is about your
87:02 current work you're working with Eric
87:04 Davis or have work with Eric Davis and
87:06 you are working with how put off death
87:08 and these are the preeminent some of the
87:12 preeminent physicists are our planet
87:14 dealing with the notion of
87:17 faster-than-light or you know
87:20 interstellar travel angry and so my
87:23 question to you is regarding TTS a is
87:25 part of that program that you're working
87:29 on right now at ETS a does that involve
87:31 research and development of a current
87:33 possibly working model that might
87:36 duplicate or approximate the ability to
87:39 cancel out gravity are you guys working
87:41 on an antigravity spacecraft at this
87:44 time right now
87:51 Wow damn of where we are really working
88:07 hard
88:08 yeah you're pushing me almost off the
88:10 stage we are working really hard to
88:14 understand what it takes in order to to
88:18 develop anti-gravity and what that means
88:24 because we realize now that that that
88:27 gravity this everybody associates as
88:30 being gravity it's not that's an
88:34 effective gravity this is an effect of
88:36 the warping of space-time which is all
88:39 around us and if and the speed at which
88:42 you see this varies all around the
88:45 universe
88:46 which means space-time varies all around
88:49 the universe that's its fact that just
88:52 showed it to you so yeah we are working
89:00 trying to figure that out and whether it
89:03 be through mathematics scientific
89:07 modeling or looking at exotic
89:10 combinations of materials that's exactly
89:14 over trended
89:26 can I go to the bathroom you know I I
89:33 sat in on some of the investigator field
89:37 investigator training and uh I was very
89:39 impressed with the level of technical
89:45 specificity the accuracy the
89:48 scrupulousness about change is amazing
89:51 she thanks first test and so I'm sorry
89:55 folks but I can't express a little
89:57 disappointment about the caliber of
89:59 questions that came to you tonight some
90:03 of them I've waited 43 years for this
90:08 kind of revelation and I would think
90:11 that of all the venues in which you
90:15 could deliver this kind of information
90:17 that the questions would been a little
90:21 bit more directed towards things that
90:22 you can answer rather than constantly
90:27 pressing for things that obviously you
90:29 can't or shouldn't what you said earlier
90:34 about the conversation taking on a
90:40 different tone a year from now it's also
90:44 relates to what you were saying about
90:46 words mean something very specific you
90:51 know the phrase you use there I've heard
90:54 a number of times wake up people it
90:57 means something okay
90:58 hint hint I've been annoyed by this in
91:02 my own life where you start to say
91:06 something it's it's there's a thing
91:08 called a syllogism a B therefore C he's
91:14 given us a he's telling us a year from
91:17 now they'll be B would you letting get
91:21 there you know anyway I just want to say
91:25 thank you for what you've done so far
91:27 and it's a estable inestimable value
91:32 to the you know the the goals that we
91:36 are pursuing here thank you very much
91:39 well thank you sir has been my honor and
91:40 pleasure folks thank you sincerely I
91:48 really appreciate your hospitality and
91:50 your patience I know I tend to Yammer
91:52 quite a bit but thank you very much mrs.
91:59 little I'd like to thank you for being
92:01 here and being with us we really enjoyed
92:03 it 

==========SbAtCzZIIsk==========

00:00 yeah the the approach to evaluating
00:03 these materials is very much a
00:05 step-by-step process so I could not just
00:10 lay out or what all steps you're going
00:11 to take because certain steps depend on
00:14 the results you get from the previous
00:16 step to start we'll look at it it's a
00:19 physical structure under high
00:22 magnification just ordinary microscopes
00:24 and so on keep notes on what kind of
00:28 details we see is there evidence of you
00:34 know nano engineering or whatever and
00:37 then they're certain straightforward
00:39 simple things we can do like measuring
00:41 conductivity across through different
00:43 surfaces and that kind of stuff and then
00:45 the next layer that we always do is to
00:47 determine chemical constituents and so
00:50 for that we have x-ray fluorescence
00:52 analyzers which bombard the material
00:55 with x-rays to excite the nuclei and
00:59 then the radiation coming off the nuclei
01:01 in response have certain signature lines
01:06 and those get plotted out so if it's
01:10 magnesium or iron or copper or zinc or
01:15 whatever you get a nice plot that runs
01:18 out and you see these lines that are
01:20 associated with each of the chemical
01:22 elements how accurate is that that can
01:25 be very accurate I mean we're down to
01:28 where you you can distinguish between
01:32 elements that are right next to each
01:34 other in the periodic table so if
01:35 there's anything unusual in there we
01:40 should be able to be able to see it on
01:43 the other hand if we decide you know
01:46 maybe there's some subtleties of nuances
01:48 there then as part of our procedure
01:52 another step would be to outsource it to
01:55 other laboratories that we have access
01:57 to which have even finer scale so this
02:01 initial thing is just to sort of give us
02:03 the overall view and so we say okay as
02:06 these chemical constituents
02:09 we'd like to determine the isotopy
02:12 content of those particular chemical
02:15 elements because it turns out that the
02:18 signature whether a piece of material is
02:21 from terrestrial sources or potentially
02:25 extraterrestrial sources you know even
02:27 including like meteorites that come in
02:29 or whatever can have a different
02:31 signature so for that we go then to to
02:35 facility that we have access and
02:37 contracts with here in Austin and then
02:42 they get measurements of the isotope
02:45 ratios as compared to the expected trust
02:50 riyal
02:51 ratios copy and then from that it
02:53 depended defense what we get you know if
02:56 it turns out that it looks pretty
02:59 terrestrial okay then you know we may
03:02 stop at that point but if it looks like
03:03 it's a non terrestrial distribution then
03:08 we can look a little closer the
03:10 determine okay so yeah it could be non
03:13 terrestrial because it's say a meteorite
03:15 comes from outside the solar system or
03:18 it could be non terrestrial because it
03:20 was engineered some in another solar
03:22 system so then we would go deeper steps
03:26 to look for all the evidence of
03:29 Engineering and then depending on what
03:31 we find
03:32 you know if there's layering and
03:34 materials that are bonded together you
03:37 know we go into the regular literature
03:38 determine okay yeah is there are there
03:41 problems bonding these kinds of
03:42 materials together or not so then and
03:44 then it then it becomes like a tree and
03:46 you have all these branches to follow
03:48 with regard to bonding with regard to
03:51 isotope ratios and so then at that point
03:55 it's the data the leads us so it's it's
03:58 hard to say in advance you know where we
04:02 would go with it I mean you might get to
04:04 a certain point where we actually do
04:05 experiments with a radiating material
04:08 with certain frequencies that have come
04:12 out from making measurements on on the
04:16 material which show that it presumably
04:19 has resonances at certain frequencies
04:21 that kind of thing so so it the the
04:26 number of tracks that can go down it can
04:28 be very great and then the number of you
04:32 still have a lot of choices you can say
04:35 okay do I want to go in the lab and make
04:39 measurements on the material or radiate
04:41 the material see what I'm responsible
04:43 yeah or do I want to do simulation
04:46 analysis in exquisite computer programs
04:50 to lay down properties that we find with
04:53 the material and then in computer
04:56 simulations I determine what would
04:58 happen if it were irradiated with this
05:00 frequency or that frequency so some of
05:03 the investigation would not necessarily
05:05 be physically in the lab but would be
05:09 with simulations on computers so I mean
05:13 it's it depends at each step what we
05:16 decide to do the next step is going to
05:18 depend on what we found in the previous
05:19 day
05:24 [Applause]

05:30 you

=========9BorF1mEKhA==========

02:46 are we on is this as we are live on
02:49 Facebook
02:50 hello everybody my name is Tom DeLonge
02:52 and over here you have Louise Elizondo
02:54 but we going to welcome Bob bill Joe I'm
02:57 not sensitive well AJ couldn't be here
02:59 today the author but the hurricane is is
03:02 ravaging the East Coast but he will be
03:04 calling in I wanted to say thank you for
03:06 everyone that is slowly coming on and
03:08 tuning in to our our little live event
03:11 we're really excited to talk about the
03:14 secret machines book the second one this
03:16 is a big deal for us because this is
03:19 kind of our flagship what we call a
03:21 franchise which is a story that we hope
03:24 to add on to it it's like why and it
03:26 gets better over time but AJ will call
03:28 in we'll talk to him a little bit the
03:30 other thing that's really cool about
03:31 this that we haven't done before is this
03:33 is kind of an opportunity for you just
03:34 to talk freely I think a lot of people
03:36 are like you know they want to get to me
03:38 and they want to talk to me about the
03:39 subject of UFOs but this is a this is
03:42 almost as good as it can get for a lot
03:44 of people out there to talk to a guy
03:45 from the DoD about this stuff and you do
03:48 have live questions coming in we do so
03:50 yeah so on yeah that is my hello
03:53 to you guys I think we're gonna be on
03:55 this live feed I think it only goes for
03:57 it's like something like 94 hours
03:59 straight no food no bathroom breaks a
04:01 marathon it's a marathon but we will be
04:04 here for a little bit and that is my
04:07 greeting so we had we have a little
04:09 sheet here so I just did the greeting
04:11 part yes what's the next part so thank
04:14 you all for being here I am Lou and I'm
04:18 going to be trying to keep Tom on target
04:21 with a national agenda we have I'll be
04:23 doing my best
04:25 let's start with first of all where they
04:29 could find this signed book of yours
04:31 yeah so we're doing this with premier
04:33 collectibles calm Matt and Eric have
04:35 been kind enough to come out here and
04:36 set all this up for us they have been
04:39 wonderful I've been spending I had to go
04:41 out to the tropics for a week with Matt
04:44 and Eric and just we live together we
04:47 slept together we ate together
04:49 it was an incredible time to really
04:52 understand how they wanted this event to
04:54 unfold it was a little bit cumbersome I
04:57 thought they could have just sent me an
04:59 email but I did it nonetheless
05:01 but they're great guys so what we do
05:04 here is we're gonna signing all these
05:06 books and they're available premier
05:08 collectibles calm and which is a great
05:11 thing because we're doing a signing here
05:14 at to the Stars later but obviously not
05:16 everyone can make that it's kind of lame
05:19 if you don't come out to it some people
05:20 did fly from London I heard it's so if
05:23 you're in London and you didn't fly out
05:25 you're kind of lazy but I do actually I
05:30 just met a very nice girl that drove up
05:32 in Colorado how's this because we're
05:34 gonna be getting into some consciousness
05:36 stuff you know serendipity is one of
05:37 these things that people always talk
05:39 about it's tied to it this girl has this
05:42 really cool art project she's working on
05:44 her name is janae and yes I met her at a
05:46 coffee shop and she drove from Colorado
05:49 out here not to get anything sign but
05:52 just to stand in the line and hand me a
05:54 little proposal about this art project
05:57 but I happen to be at the coffee shop
05:59 just sitting there reading the news and
06:01 she happened to be there and so I hope
06:04 they the trip became worth it for her I
06:06 thought I got it
06:07 I read the proposal it's really cool
06:09 what she's doing so there's a little
06:11 shout out and I pass it off to the right
06:12 people Thank You janae yeah that's good
06:14 oh oh eat what does this mean is mean
06:18 eating I guess start signing that no so
06:20 we're supposed to keep you on track zoom
06:22 so let's let's say we start in the
06:24 meantime while we start signing some of
06:27 these books why don't you tell us a
06:29 little bit what what aspired you to
06:32 write this book well as you know by the
06:36 way there is there are trains that pass
06:37 by so you might hear a train every once
06:39 in a while is that what inspired you a
06:41 train the Train inspiring well you know
06:44 a lot of people ask me where I got
06:45 really excited about the subject of UFOs
06:47 and when that started with me it was
06:49 junior high and I don't know why just
06:53 one day wanted to to go out and start
06:56 reading about this stuff and and learn
06:58 about this stuff
06:59 but the more you get into it as you know
07:01 more than I it brings in physics it
07:05 brings in ancient you know subjects like
07:07 religion and you know mankind's long
07:12 controversial history on this earth and
07:14 it brings in politics and it brings in
07:17 biology and cosmology and so if you
07:20 start to get into UFOs a little bit you
07:22 start to realize like it's like kind of
07:24 a never-ending rabbit hole so when we
07:26 started to the Stars and I wanted to get
07:28 into filmmaking
07:29 I just I felt like this was the story
07:32 that was never told we've seen all the
07:33 UFO movies I mean you've seen Close
07:35 Encounters and that's probably the best
07:37 one but usually they do like the
07:39 Independence Day kind of stuff and no
07:41 one really treats the subject the way
07:44 the way I think it really is you know um
07:46 you know you know we've all read you
07:50 know the stories about we know like
07:51 commander flavor had the intercept with
07:54 the UFO off the the event with the
07:56 Nimitz right this book was like you know
07:59 not this book but this whole story was
08:01 really an attempt to put those kind of
08:03 moments like and make them really
08:05 palpable and real for for people because
08:08 I don't think people think of that kind
08:09 of stuff they think of like lights in
08:12 the sky or they think of just the weird
08:16 or kind of stuff or like UFOs blowing up
08:18 the White House or something but they
08:19 never really think about what it's
08:20 really like which is more unnerving I
08:23 think because there's so much more
08:24 mystery around it that something's
08:26 moving
08:26 30 40 80 thousand miles an hour and we
08:29 sent out a pilot that has to see it up
08:31 close and I thought that would be cool
08:34 well so that neat leads to the next
08:36 obvious question when did you first
08:38 really start getting interested in this
08:39 topic
08:40 well the the interest hardcore came with
08:44 a baccalaureate Orion the ban we didn't
08:47 have smartphones so you know I'm gonna
08:51 read which is really whistling who's the
08:53 reverb activated what's that yeah so we
08:55 have buy books and we we would just sit
08:59 in the van for like 10 hour trips every
09:01 single day and all you do is just you
09:03 read because you're not on the internet
09:04 in any kind of way
09:05 so I started reading some books and I
09:07 remember the first book I read was
09:09 called I think it's called a um what was
09:12 it I think it was called above top
09:13 secret and I think it's just a
09:14 chronological order of things that that
09:17 happened but with UFO since like God had
09:21 a been since World War two and went
09:23 through all the NASA stuff and went
09:25 through a bunch of stuff in the Vietnam
09:27 War went through a bunch of stuff that
09:28 happen in the 80s
09:29 and and you start to realize go wow this
09:32 isn't really I mean it's esoteric but
09:35 it's it's not really as esoteric when
09:38 you read it that way when you're reading
09:39 stuff that happened to pilots and
09:41 trained observers and astronauts and
09:43 governments of the world at that moment
09:46 I remember too is like my band's worst
09:47 nightmare because then I started talking
09:49 about it all the time in the van and
09:51 market travelers should be like or at
09:53 the time it was Scott but there just be
09:54 like dude you got to stop talking about
09:57 fairy tales and like we're wizards and
10:00 ghosts because that's what it sounds
10:01 like you know um but that was like that
10:04 what that was the beginning of my
10:05 obsession anything so you know I got to
10:08 ask then and I'm sure a lot of people
10:10 want to know how did you go from reading
10:12 something in the back of a van you know
10:15 going to gigs and touring to to putting
10:19 together a group of individuals
10:21 like-minded individuals a lot with
10:23 government backgrounds to to to pursue
10:26 this in a very serious way there's a big
10:30 difference between reading a book that
10:33 you find on the shelf or in a library
10:34 and creating a company devoting your
10:37 life right and to doing something like
10:40 this what what how did that occur and
10:42 what inspired that I have always kind of
10:45 loved while you're signing by sorry
10:50 books you're gonna get out yeah you know
10:56 upsetting the applecart has always kind
10:58 of been in my
10:59 be a mom I'm a punker first and foremost
11:02 I think for you you'd probably say I'm a
11:04 spy first for older soldier or a patriot
11:06 or an insurgent and certainly but for me
11:09 like I I punk rock wasn't just about a
11:11 music thing it was really about pressing
11:14 up against the status quo and I think
11:16 the people that were really like you
11:18 know really big blink fans you know the
11:20 thing with a band like that it's not a
11:22 rarely just about the songs it's about
11:24 the ethos and the culture and you know
11:27 the idea that we were you know we
11:29 thought a certain way about the world
11:32 and so you know we would sing really
11:35 fast happy songs you know but that was
11:37 just a way to try and break out a broken
11:38 families and stuff but but it's always
11:41 been in my DNA to try to upset the
11:43 applecart a little bit and I remember
11:45 the only two things in my life have been
11:46 really passionate about were music in
11:48 this subject so after the band you know
11:50 had it's had its big ride and it's still
11:53 going I kind of just realized I was you
11:57 know when I had my 40th birthday I think
12:00 man I kind of really I got a really
12:02 attack something with the subject if I
12:04 want to do anything about if I want to
12:06 be involved with it if I want to you
12:08 know have any kind of mark I'll know
12:10 because I already knew is real I already
12:11 knew you know how important this subject
12:14 was but I was really having kids -
12:15 you're kind of thinking about man this
12:17 world's a pretty up place and
12:18 what are some what's a subject that can
12:21 really change how people think about
12:22 themselves how people could change how
12:24 they think about each other
12:25 what's a subject that could bring in a
12:27 radical technology that can
12:29 revolutionize everything there's no
12:31 other subject I can think of that
12:32 touches so many of the sciences and the
12:35 arts than this so I I've made a hardcore
12:39 decision that this is my chance to do
12:42 something about it so when we started
12:44 the secret machines book though to be
12:46 honest I was really scared of people
12:49 like you that's so what happened was is
12:51 I like if I come out with this
12:52 first book and I don't kind of if I
12:57 don't go and ask for permission so to
12:59 speak I didn't want a lot of important
13:02 people in a lot of important places
13:05 misunderstanding that I was an advocate
13:07 and that I under
13:09 stand that there's a lot that we still
13:11 need to know and it gets tricky and so
13:14 so at that moment I said I should used a
13:17 little bit of notoriety I got and I
13:19 should try to meet people like yourself
13:22 but it was funny because I wasn't
13:24 allowed to meet you I was told and I
13:26 definitely wasn't allowed to meet yeah
13:29 you know so it what I and I think what
13:32 happened was is I just spent a really
13:34 long time knocking on doors you know and
13:37 some really kind people that really
13:40 listened to me you know at first was
13:44 this isn't real but I have someone I
13:46 want you to talk to you know and that
13:48 does wit lot longer and longer next
13:49 thing you know I was surrounded by some
13:51 heavy hitters you know well as you
13:53 continue to sign these one of the things
13:55 I find so fascinating tom is that I
13:57 think a lot of folks indeed and out
13:59 there in the audience would agree that
14:02 you go and you succeed at pursuing your
14:05 dream in the entertainment business and
14:07 as a rock and roller only to then chase
14:10 a new dream that probably some people
14:13 thought frankly this guy's got to be
14:15 crazy for leaving a successful business
14:17 to go pursue something else now and yet
14:20 I would argue that in essence it's
14:24 really that spirit of being a catalyst
14:26 that has allowed us to now take a topic
14:29 that was once considered very taboo a
14:31 lot of stigma associated with it and
14:34 actually be able to have a conversation
14:35 about it a rational cover yes the me up
14:38 me ask you because the people watching
14:41 are way more interested and the guy that
14:44 ran the government's UFO program than
14:46 what tom thinks about it mask you know
14:49 intimately and so much what you know is
14:51 still classified that none of us can
14:53 ever know but you know you know the
14:58 stigma attached to this could you dealt
14:59 with it on how has it changed since all
15:02 this like to you into your ear because
15:04 you're still so tied into the government
15:06 with people you know and I heard like
15:08 how has it changed that you've seems
15:10 well I I will I will admittedly say I
15:12 didn't change it actually you're the
15:14 guys that changed it and that is you
15:17 know I did this and my colleagues and I
15:19 did this day
15:20 day out for damn near a decade and we
15:24 couldn't be give people that our own
15:25 building to have a conversation and
15:26 that's why I said before as a catalyst
15:29 people probably wondering how it is you
15:31 could leave a successful business model
15:33 behind and and pursuing your dreams as a
15:36 rock and roller for this and how do you
15:38 not have done it this way I don't think
15:40 we'd be having this conversation so
15:42 don't look now but we're having this
15:44 conversation because of things like this
15:46 that you took the time to have a
15:49 conversation about whether you do it as
15:51 a novel you do it as fiction nonfiction
15:53 I think that's something that that I
15:56 think that was you well maybe you can
16:01 definitely say though that now you have
16:05 colleagues and all different agencies of
16:08 the government that talk about this a
16:10 little bit different now right in part
16:12 because of what you did yeah I think so
16:14 I think we should definitely really give
16:17 me as much credit as possible I'm just
16:19 saying I love it and I'll take it and
16:22 I'll just say no no no no but what Luce
16:25 saying here and he's so kind as he's
16:27 trying to act as though it really was a
16:31 lot of me but the biggest risk out of
16:33 everyone was you the biggest biggest
16:37 risk and I remember how you're around
16:40 anger I was getting when people were
16:41 me like in the press or wherever
16:44 and I was just so mad because people
16:46 have no idea what you went through to
16:47 make this I didn't particularly like it
16:49 either yeah but uh but it's it's it's I
16:52 do hear the reason I asked Lou about the
16:54 stigma is because I've been privy to
16:57 conversations and I know some of your
16:59 friends I don't know all of them it's
17:02 just so different now within the
17:03 government because of how the Academy
17:06 two stars Academy is handling the
17:08 subject it's it's just really cool but
17:10 before we move on though you asked me
17:13 when I got into this you went into the
17:14 running the UFO program at Department of
17:17 Defense and you weren't into UFOs No so
17:20 how them what the hell happened I was
17:23 voluntold you got a basically any we
17:26 need your help to do something you know
17:28 for me there was little ribs
17:30 because I was being asked by the
17:32 government to do something but I got to
17:33 see I stepped in baby steps like I I got
17:36 into it I read some books I talked about
17:38 the stuff I go on the internet you
17:39 literally got brought into running the
17:43 program that's that's why I say baptism
17:45 by fire you know that must have been
17:47 with a lot of good people I had the
17:48 backing of a lot of really good people
17:50 on the team I didn't do it alone
17:52 I had there were people there senior
17:53 people that were professionals in there
17:55 and their line of work and it was a
17:58 joint effort absolutely but the
17:59 information download like did you like
18:01 all sudden not sleep for like a week
18:03 because you weren't even thinking about
18:05 this subject and boom it's all on your
18:07 desk you're like hold on a sec you
18:09 didn't have a slow and dr. nation
18:11 no I didn't was just what was that like
18:14 I guess that's the question our you know
18:16 for different people it's different some
18:18 people have a moment an epiphany moment
18:21 where all of a sudden it's just ah ha
18:22 realization that oh my god we're talking
18:25 about UFOs in other cases some people
18:28 have a slow steady realization that
18:30 we're talking about technology that
18:32 we're not familiar with and each
18:34 person's a little different for me it
18:36 was a probably a mixture of both there
18:41 was a point where I knew we were talking
18:42 about something that wasn't ours and
18:44 probably not for an adversarial but at
18:48 the same time you know calm steady
18:53 approaches I think would need and I work
18:56 in it in a line of work where everybody
18:57 pretty much feels the same way you're
18:59 talking about people who are trained to
19:00 to solve problems in a methodical way
19:03 not jump to any conclusion because you
19:05 did a lot of other stuff besides them
19:07 yeah yeah we did well that's what people
19:08 don't know too is that um obviously I
19:11 wasn't able to know everything about
19:12 your job but I do know that you ran
19:15 multiple programs what not just the UFO
19:18 one so why so you were primarily a form
19:23 of a spy a counterintelligence spy I say
19:27 that word because it's cool as and
19:29 I wish I was one I feel like once I
19:31 played he doesn't ride on me but uh but
19:33 why would they choose that to run a UFO
19:37 bro that's something that I've never
19:38 we've never heard you talk about and is
19:40 something that
19:41 always fascinating fascinated me that
19:43 the UFO program would be run by guys
19:48 that are spies and truthfully there was
19:51 somebody early on be long before I met
19:53 you that didn't know what my intentions
19:56 were and he was a spy too and sat down
19:59 with me is like what what do you what
20:02 are you doing what's going on here you
20:03 know and I and now that was the first
20:05 time it's really interesting that this
20:08 subject is with people that are trained
20:09 like that because intelligence is all
20:11 about the art of finding answers to
20:14 questions that you don't have an answer
20:16 for it and so that makes sense then
20:19 naturally I would fall within Intel but
20:22 you also had engineers and physicists
20:24 and stuff working with you we did and
20:26 they were they were like-minded as well
20:28 with that said Tom unfortunately I am
20:31 gonna have to shift gears here and start
20:33 getting to some questions here from your
20:35 fans
20:36 because you have some you have a lot of
20:37 fans and they've got a lot of questions
20:39 and we promised we would get by you guys
20:41 have a questions out there nobody wants
20:44 to hear about me they want to hear about
20:45 you you know what's so funny you know
20:47 that's not the truth
20:48 I'm just to say everything that I do
20:50 everything I say
20:51 used to be classified and I'll tell you
20:53 guys for the first time and they'll make
20:54 it much better and much cooler Tom I
20:56 have two daughters and they will both
20:57 tell you that I'm probably the most
20:58 boring person in the world it's not sure
21:00 I've seen your motorcycle that gave you
21:02 a lot of cool points he's got this
21:04 Russian made motorcycle I put it on
21:06 Instagram with that with a sidecar and
21:09 it has not been changed since World War
21:11 two right the design is is is pretty
21:14 consistent with the original machine I
21:16 have ever been on soup but though ride a
21:19 motorcycle without a helmet so let's
21:21 start to get us some questions here
21:22 let's start with Ari from Seattle
21:26 all right wants to know if you could get
21:28 an answer to any question what would you
21:31 ask
21:34 you're not gonna want me to answer that
21:36 we did I'll tell you guys that how many
21:39 times my team walks into my office shuts
21:41 the door and says look don't be you and
21:46 don't don't say what you're really
21:48 thinking all the time okay but if I was
21:50 let me let me try and think about that
21:52 if I was gonna ask on any question if I
21:56 was if I was to ask any question and get
22:00 the answer to I don't know there's a lot
22:05 of things I'm trying to think of the
22:06 tame a tame question I would ask her I
22:10 think the question would be how many
22:16 whoa okay they'll do this I won't
22:19 pretend this question is pointed towards
22:20 any of the governments of the world this
22:22 is more just like a question I can
22:24 present that will get an answer and you
22:26 keep handing books I'll do the last one
22:28 because I got you're stressing me out
22:32 I wouldn't have to go schedule that you
22:34 know I would ask how how many types of
22:42 visitors have been here throughout
22:45 mankind's history even though it's short
22:46 now I have a feeling it's probably
22:48 longer than we think
22:49 but I would like to know we tend to
22:50 think of UFO so there's got to be an
22:53 occupant so that's what it is who is
22:55 that I tend to think the universe is
22:58 really big it's probably gonna be much
23:01 more complex of an answer so I would
23:03 like to know what it is and how many
23:07 different versions of it it is good is
23:10 that a good and interesting yeah re what
23:12 do you think let's go with Melissa Tom
23:18 the Melissa is from New York will you
23:22 join in conversations with the
23:24 quote/unquote ancient astronaut
23:26 theorists will I will I join in the
23:31 problem with the ancient astronaut stuff
23:34 is they have a wonderful show on it and
23:38 I love the show as well but as you know
23:40 they're not approaching it with a
23:43 scientific method so
23:44 that did was unfortunately make it a
23:47 little bit harder to jump into using
23:50 though you jump into the subject with
23:51 those terms and I think this is a
23:54 question back at you is because this is
23:56 really me coming when you came on board
23:58 and when Jim simav an from CIA came on
24:02 board it was really about we have to
24:04 stay academic and scientific because
24:07 that is exactly what's needed for people
24:10 to have a credible conversation so what
24:14 you know my question to you is why is
24:16 that so important that we stick with
24:18 just the very bait because we can't
24:20 prove everything scientifically but I
24:24 when I think about the ancient astronaut
24:26 thing those terms bring up television
24:29 sure I think you know there's there's
24:31 nothing wrong with with beliefs and you
24:34 know I one of our colleagues says this
24:35 all the time there are four categories
24:38 of information information that you know
24:40 information that you think information
24:42 that you believe and information that
24:44 you don't know and all too many times
24:45 information on what you believe and
24:47 information what you know gets confused
24:49 I think the more we can take speculation
24:53 and innuendos out of it some positions
24:55 out of a calculus and just let the hard
24:58 data and facts speak for themselves the
25:00 better ancient alien theorists could be
25:01 absolutely correct we're not saying
25:02 they're wrong or they're right or
25:03 anything else well we're simply doing is
25:05 trying to collect the data and allow
25:07 that data to speak for itself and then
25:10 let everybody else up make up their mind
25:11 what that data means well you know what
25:13 I want to do so we had this conversation
25:14 one of the reasons I was so excited
25:16 about the on about the ability to take
25:20 the company public and have people
25:21 invest was I wanted to have the
25:23 resources one day to send out our own
25:25 archaeologists our own geologists our
25:29 own groups of physicists and of every
25:31 type of background and I would love to
25:34 send a team down to Antarctica I would
25:36 love to send a team over to the Middle
25:38 East and I would love for us to get into
25:40 that conversation so it's so we can
25:42 actually support shows like ancient
25:45 aliens but with actual science I think
25:47 that would be like every time we hear
25:49 something on the internet that's kind of
25:51 weird and unusual it's like people kind
25:54 of like sometimes there's these
25:55 like hey there might be a big haul up in
25:57 north the North Pole I was like wouldn't
25:59 it be cool if we can dispatch its the
26:01 team there to go dig dig and see this I
26:04 wanted this company to be like a big
26:06 treasure hunt I thought that would be so
26:07 cool and just as important as proving
26:09 something exists is also being able to
26:10 prove that it doesn't exist Wow so being
26:13 able to go up and collect the facts and
26:14 say hey look the facts don't don't
26:16 support I went out one time with a bunch
26:19 of friends we traveled up to Northern
26:21 California this is g-rated by the way I
26:23 just make sure we okay we'll keep this
26:25 big so I went out to on the go do a
26:29 camping trip and we decided to make it a
26:30 Bigfoot trip and what we proved was
26:33 Bigfoot was not there we proved that he
26:36 was not where we were so I thought its
26:37 kind of science right sure science and
26:39 next question is from Joel he's writing
26:46 to us from Queensland what would be a
26:49 pivotal moment that you would say
26:51 changed your life in your pursuit of
26:53 UFOs and secret machines oh my god the
26:58 the most pivotal moment I had was
27:03 sitting with a group of important people
27:06 and they asked me a bit about my project
27:11 and they said what else do you need to
27:15 get your project done and I remember
27:17 saying well I I feel like I need a
27:20 couple advisers and these areas because
27:23 it seems like a pretty broad subject and
27:25 I and I want to make sure that you know
27:28 I want to make sure that you know I I
27:31 have everyone's permission or something
27:33 like that and I remember he looked at me
27:35 and he said he goes do you ask your dad
27:38 for permission after your mom's already
27:39 given it to you and I said no why and
27:41 he's all you've been given permission
27:43 shut the up and get to work and I
27:45 remember at that moment I realized
27:48 something I didn't realize yet that I
27:51 had the support of a lot of really
27:53 important people and now they're looking
27:56 at me like now go get your job done and
27:59 I'm really goose bumps I had because I
28:01 just all I wanted was these guys to kind
28:04 of believe
28:05 that I had a way in to the public with
28:07 this didn't seem easy didn't know how
28:10 long it would take but that was the
28:11 first moment that I felt like people
28:13 supported me that were that were more
28:18 you know that had that held rank with
28:21 this subject so that was that was a big
28:23 deal for me okay um Danielle oh sorry
28:30 about apologies Daniel from Utah wants
28:34 to know pineapple on pizza yes or no
28:39 really no pizzas not made for vitamins
28:43 and minerals like they should actually
28:45 have a process on it right now that he's
28:47 shrewd on pizza they should have a
28:49 process to extract vitamins and minerals
28:51 from a pizza not helping yeah yeah no
28:55 keep your pineapples on ice cream and
28:57 things like that not on hands it that's
28:58 it's it's not American it says the
29:01 entire merit I believe honestly I
29:02 believe it's communist yeah pineapples
29:06 in general so there's a communist fruit
29:08 I know like I don't live here I plan
29:10 upon Hawaii like literally like fresh
29:12 it's super so we need water afterward
29:14 it's so good yeah it is crazy sweet glad
29:17 we went over there
29:18 so from F from Guaynabo Puerto Rico if
29:23 you had a chance to ask in et presume
29:26 they exist a question what would that
29:30 question be only one I would say that's
29:36 a really good question I would ask on
29:40 will you help us build our propulsion
29:43 system I would say you know I would ask
29:47 him how you know we have some really
29:49 interesting material at the company and
29:51 I would ask how how has this made well
29:55 that question now would that have been a
29:56 different question a year ago yeah a
29:59 year ago I would have probably asked
30:01 like who are you and where you're from
30:03 but now that the Academy is up and
30:05 running I really feel that we like this
30:08 is like a deep deep seeded passion of
30:10 mine that I really feel we have the
30:12 ability to build a technology that's
30:16 that's like what we observe and that's
30:18 dr. poot offs whole studies that he's
30:22 been doing with you for 10 years that
30:23 he's been doing on his own for decades
30:25 the space-time metric which is the
30:28 bending and folding space-time which is
30:30 what everyone knows the Academy is after
30:33 with Steve justice from Lockheed and all
30:35 these other people that work here now I
30:36 think I would go if I et's exist existed
30:41 I probably would go and ask him
30:42 something very specific about our
30:45 propulsion system versus because I'm
30:47 less interested now I'm interested but
30:49 less so about like where you come from
30:51 and what are you about it's like how do
30:52 we build this like because we know it's
30:54 it's a revolutionary leap that and I
30:57 believe that we can do this but we had
30:59 definitely have so much more work to do
31:01 ok this one is a little bit off-topic
31:07 but I think probably still pretty pretty
31:10 interesting question Matthew from Texas
31:13 wants to know what is your opinion and
31:15 this is definitely question for you what
31:17 is your opinion on modern punk and pop
31:19 punk music it's a good question I think
31:26 you know over the years
31:28 punk music has the better parts of it
31:32 have merged with other types of music so
31:34 it's not so segregated anymore it's not
31:36 like here's your punk bands here's your
31:39 hip-hop bands you kind of see things
31:41 blending together so it's not so much
31:43 like these punk bands are good or not I
31:46 kind of look at music in a hole where
31:48 there's a segment of music where the
31:49 that kind of that idea of upsetting the
31:52 applecart and pushing back and having a
31:54 voice and having some angst I see that
31:56 in other types of music so my opinion is
31:59 great as long as it's growing if you
32:00 hear a band literally doing the exact
32:03 same thing as any other band you know
32:05 like right now if I created a band to
32:07 sound just like The Ramones like why
32:10 would I do that the Ramones are like
32:11 incredible and I'll never be as good as
32:13 them so why would I try to emulate
32:16 exactly hmm that's my feeling so if
32:19 there are pop punk bands that are doing
32:21 that just I I don't support that I
32:24 support them expressing their emotions
32:26 and I support them creating music
32:28 however they want but I've come to love
32:32 the artistic challenge and writing music
32:34 and I think that the time for just doing
32:38 it exactly like everybody else in the
32:40 beginnings of this kind of music I think
32:42 that time has come and gone I think now
32:44 you got to challenge yourself a little
32:46 bit more so originality originality is
32:48 important I don't think it was that
32:49 important in the beginning of punk music
32:51 I think it was all an emotional vehicle
32:55 just to express yourself but that has
32:58 been done so many times originality is a
33:01 form of emotional expression of shows
33:03 that you care it shows that you're
33:04 willing to challenge yourself to be
33:06 heard it shows that you're not uniform
33:09 and there's a lot of the punk scene was
33:11 all about not being like everybody else
33:13 so if you create abandoned sounds
33:15 exactly like another band
33:16 you're just being a lemming you know and
33:19 I was that's the whole point of what not
33:21 to be so interesting yeah so we're gonna
33:24 take a phone call real quick from an
33:27 individual you know we're gonna put him
33:29 on speakerphone yay
33:30 this is mr. Hartley AJ Hartley yes
33:35 how are you so are we gonna be at can
33:37 they pick this up on the microphone
33:40 AJ first of all sorry you couldn't be
33:44 here today but how's the hurricane doing
34:11 that's I hope that I hope that
34:18 everything goes okay for you guys out
34:20 there we miss you out here but this is a
34:22 good opportunity for you to finally meet
34:24 Lou
34:25 your paths haven't really crossed yet
34:27 but he's sitting here right here next to
34:30 me and you know this is really
34:33 interesting because remember when we
34:35 first started the secret machines ride
34:37 it was just you and I didn't expanded to
34:41 some you know military types and then it
34:45 expanded to a bunch of intelligence
34:46 types and then we got Lu who actually
34:49 ran the program so this is a good a good
34:51 time for you guys to even have a have a
34:53 conversation about this stuff so I think
34:56 somebody's some of the people gonna want
34:58 to ask questions stuff but I think you
34:59 probably have a lot of questions too but
35:01 yeah he's right here mr. Harley it's
35:03 pleasure to meet you I'll be it over
35:06 over phone hopefully the hurricane isn't
35:08 impacting you and your state too bad
35:11 obviously reading the headlines you know
35:13 deep sympathy for those individuals who
35:16 have been affected by it but I would
35:19 like to ask you a question how is it
35:22 working with Tom yeah
35:48 [Music]
35:58 [Music]
36:24 you know well I think what's fascinating
36:45 to to a lot of people is that you and
36:48 Tom work together and you both have the
36:50 same common goal and vision and I think
36:55 it I think that chemistry works works
36:57 really really well and you know I what
37:02 can I say I think it's it's it's a it's
37:05 a really good obviously you guys have
37:06 really good chemistry in it I find it
37:08 interesting from you as being an
37:10 intellectual and Tom of course being a
37:12 creative not that that's not what I bet
37:17 but being so creative and and of course
37:20 your side being so intellectual I think
37:23 it's really neat to see that come
37:24 together and and you know you have
37:26 something like this secret machines that
37:28 that is wildly entertaining but at the
37:31 same time you know has a lot of basis
37:34 and facts which i think is really
37:35 interesting
37:57 [Music]
38:12 [Laughter]
38:30 [Music]
38:50 [Music]
39:01 fascinating fascinating
39:03 well mr. Hartley it's been a pleasure to
39:06 meet you and unfortunately we have a
39:07 rather tight schedule and I'm sure you
39:09 have lots of business to attend to given
39:11 the hurricane so we're gonna let you go
39:14 but but thank you sincerely for taking
39:16 the time speaking with us and again you
39:21 know praying for you guys hopefully
39:23 everything goes well with the hurricane
39:24 and you know stay safe please sure all
39:28 right thanks
39:30 okay now Tom what we're gonna do is
39:33 we're gonna we're gonna play a little
39:35 game I'm gonna need though any two of
39:39 these books because I'm gonna put
39:40 something up for the audience to see I'm
39:42 gonna put up a this is a stopwatch and
39:45 what we're gonna do on camera I'm gonna
39:47 ask you 22 questions and you've got two
39:52 minutes to answer not each all of them
39:55 and you can't know what these questions
39:57 are in advance all right okay I got to
40:00 use my noodle so
40:02 fast I gotta be quick here we go ready
40:04 set make sure I can do it okay there we

41:05 biggest pet peeve people chewing with
41:08 their mouths open what is the last book
41:10 you read what is the last book you read

43:49 have very specific you know things set
43:52 in stone with all these lawyers before I
43:54 can announce things we have so many cool
43:56 things happening and it looks like all
43:58 of our dreams of doing aerospace science
44:00 in terms of entertainment it's all
44:01 coming true so I am so excited for the
44:06 future for us but we will talk soon sign
44:09 these she'll do whose name my name yes
44:13 no one wants mine
44:22 you 

==========-l222fF_pL8==========

00:00 the initial contract vehicle was called
00:01 all SAP advanced aerospace weapons
00:05 special application programs system
00:07 application program a lot of folks will
00:10 say well Lou when you first came out why
00:13 didn't you just tell us that well the
00:16 reason is because I wasn't really part
00:18 of that and that's really not my place
00:20 to discuss a mission and an organization
00:24 that it was really walking into the tail
00:26 end I was brought into to conduct
00:29 Counter Intelligence and Security for an
00:31 organization that was in the process of
00:33 evolving into something else
00:35 there was another director running that
00:37 program so it would be disingenuous for
00:40 me to simply say well a tip is really
00:44 awesome well it evolved from all SAP but
00:47 it is not a SAP and I think the
00:50 documentation that's beginning to come
00:51 out into the public forum people are
00:54 beginning to realize that it wasn't a
00:56 purpose attempt to try to subdue or to
00:58 to hide or conceal the relationship I
01:01 just wasn't really qualified to talk
01:03 about it and what I don't want to do is
01:05 hopefully you're beginning to learn here
01:07 is provide information that I'm not
01:10 qualified to discuss with you there's
01:12 two ground rules as far as I'm concerned
01:14 involving this program I'll answer any
01:16 question you have but there's only
01:18 there's something I can't discuss which
01:20 is classified information don't ask me
01:22 I'm not going to tell you and if it
01:23 requires a classified answer I am NOT
01:26 going to violate my oath nor my mind out
01:28 my non-disclosure agreement with the US
01:30 government but short of that I'll answer
01:33 it and if I don't have an answer I'm
01:35 gonna tell you I don't have an answer
01:37 and I don't know I'll be completely as
01:38 forthcoming as I can because there are
01:40 things I don't know in fact there's a
01:41 lot more I don't know then I do know but
01:44 that's okay that's why we have to
01:46 continue to seek to find the answers and
01:47 collect the data because ultimately the
01:50 data will speak for itself the truth she
01:53 you know she's funny she always speaks
01:55 sometimes she whispers so you have to
01:57 listen real carefully but but if you
02:00 listen hard enough you you can you can
02:02 hear her speak so that's a little bit of
02:04 the the history on this slide here so as
02:08 you see here towards the end
02:10 in 2008 the program was already
02:12 beginning to
02:12 the original off sap portfolio was much
02:17 broader than the a tip the decision was
02:20 made early on that we would go ahead and
02:22 focus the effort more to the phenomena
02:25 specific looking at the observables and
02:28 the identifiable what can we look at
02:30 what can we collect on what can we
02:32 report on back to senior DOD leadership
02:35 because that's what they're concerned
02:37 with and try to remove as much
02:39 speculation supposition and innuendos as
02:42 possible out of the calculus so more
02:46 history so as you see here the 2008 02:49 through 2009 02:51 there's a there's there's a lot of
02:54 collection going on a lot to the point
02:57 where we're we're we're almost becoming
02:59 overloaded with the results in the data
03:01 it's becoming quite clear to us that
03:04 there is much more to this portfolio
03:06 than we envisioned and I suspect when
03:10 you look at this 2009 congressional
03:12 letter sent to DoD leadership Congress
03:14 was aware of that too to the point where
03:17 we were worried there may be a potential
03:20 counterintelligence threat maybe there
03:22 were foreign adversaries that were
03:24 interested in what we were collecting
03:25 that's how much we were collecting you
03:30 see down here 2009 specific elements and
03:34 DoD resists the effort this is a detail
03:37 I really haven't talked about much you
03:41 know everybody handles this information
03:42 differently and in the department is no
03:45 different than in out here in the public
03:47 forum people have their ideas that have
03:49 their preconceived notions there have
03:51 their bias and they have their belief
03:53 systems and by no means do I have the
03:57 right or the qualifications to tell
03:58 anybody what they should or should not
04:00 believe in but there are some people who
04:03 have a great deal of conviction just as
04:05 you have conviction right now in the UAP
04:09 UFO phenomena they have equal conviction
04:12 from a theological perspective in their
04:15 own and by the way that contradicts with
04:16 what we were trying to do for better for
04:19 worse and I'm not saying that's good I'm
04:21 not saying it's bad I'm just saying it's
04:22 a fact that there were elements within
04:23 the department
04:25 that rigorously opposed what we were
04:27 trying to do not because the results
04:30 were not real but because it
04:34 contradicted their view that's all I got
04:40 to say about that 2003 or 13th through
04:43 2014 you see where they say some folks
04:47 have said in the past by the way the
04:50 Department of Defense is a fantastic
04:51 organization true patriots these are
04:53 folks that give they're there they're
04:55 there they sacrifice their family's
04:56 livelihood and their life to to defend
05:00 us so so this is not necessarily a hit
05:03 on the department but sometimes the
05:07 department it's a big organization
05:09 sometimes they don't necessarily have
05:11 all the data in front of them all the
05:13 time and so when they said the program
05:15 ended in 2012 well the funding was
05:18 actually to 2013 and after 2013 there
05:22 was some other funding vehicles that
05:23 were done to get it through 2013 and
05:25 2014 okay now I won't go into detail
05:28 what happened with those fundings the
05:29 funding actually came through it
05:30 actually wound up getting rerouted to
05:32 another organization because the
05:33 language was vague and so therefore we
05:35 were reforest to continue the program on
05:38 minimal funds now people say well the
05:40 funding dries up so does your
05:41 organization in the program that's not
05:43 true when you are given a mission you're
05:45 given in order to guard your posts you
05:48 guard your posts until you are relieved
05:50 of that responsibility
05:51 well that order never came for us and in
05:55 the Department of Defense there's always
05:56 a paper trail when you establish an
05:59 organization there's a paper trail when
06:01 you disestablish an organization there's
06:04 a paper trail you won't find one for
06:06 this program so I think that's I think
06:09 that's very important that people
06:10 understand that the program never really
06:13 went away
06:14 sure funding for the 2013 went away but
06:18 the program never went away we were
06:21 never told you no longer have to guard
06:23 your post so 2017 some guy makes a dumb
06:30 decision to - I guess leave the
06:32 Department of Defense
06:36 you know and have some conversations and
06:39 in 2004 2017 the rest is history so
06:44 let's go into a little bit about what a
06:45 tip is a tip evolved from all SAP that
06:51 is absolutely true
06:52 all SAP existed for a short period of
06:54 time under another director to focus on
06:56 the UAP specific capabilities and
07:00 concentrated on the what and how
07:03 interrogatives not the who not the when
07:06 but what is it and how does it work
07:10 that's it and if we could accomplish
07:13 that hopefully smarter people in the
07:15 department could figure out who's behind
07:17 the wheel what are their intentions were
07:19 they from etc a tip was comprised of US
07:23 government contractor and military
07:25 personnel that's a fact everybody hears
07:27 about Bigelow Aerospace that is a true
07:31 statement
07:31 we worked with academics we worked with
07:35 the services we worked with certain
07:38 elements in the intelligence community
07:39 we worked with anybody in everybody with
07:42 a military Nexus that we could talk to
07:44 that could provide some information cast
07:47 a wide net eight commissioned large
07:53 volumes of related research data
07:55 academic studies and collected data even
07:58 from the field true statement volumes
08:03 and volumes of information I cannot go
08:05 into detail specifically and what some
08:07 of that is because it remains classified
08:09 I believe two days ago a laundry list of
08:12 some of our studies had come out I'll be
08:15 at one of them was classified I can tell
08:18 you that that is a correct list that is
08:23 a that is a true list of academic
08:25 studies if you get a chance to review
08:27 them I think you'll agree that once
08:29 again we're not really talking about
08:31 balloons much of a tip information
08:33 remains FOIA exempt for you exempt what
08:39 do you mean everything's FOIA below
08:41 no it's not
08:43 exceptions one-in-five why would you
08:48 mark information for you exempt well for
08:53 one so the adversary never gets a chance
08:55 to see it people say well if a chip
08:58 existed I should be able to foil it not
09:00 necessarily and some of the documents
09:03 that were recently realists released as
09:05 a result if you take a look at a recent
09:09 letter that I supposedly came from
09:11 Senator Reid on the very last page at
09:14 the very bottom you're gonna see a
09:15 really interesting little word words
09:17 actually says for you exempt that's
09:22 right
09:23 we use that sometimes now we don't use
09:26 it to keep a secret from the American
09:27 people in fact that's illegal what we do
09:30 is we use it to keep it out of the hands
09:32 of foreign adversaries and it is an
09:34 effective tool so keep in mind a lot of
09:38 the counter-argument as well you're
09:40 keeping this secret from the American
09:41 people that is not the case if we had a
09:44 mechanism where we could inform every
09:47 American citizen and ensure it didn't
09:49 get out into enemy hands we would do it
09:51 the government doesn't try to keep
09:53 secrets from you it tries to keep
09:55 secrets from the enemy and there's no
09:58 way to tell 500 million people in one
10:01 geographic region and not let that get
10:04 out somewhere else so so that is why a
10:07 lot of this information you see is FOIA
10:10 exempt now is that the right thing to do
10:12 is that the wrong thing to do I don't
10:13 know and and I I don't know
10:16 is it an effective mechanism absolutely
10:19 it is what a tip isn't this is just a
10:24 small sample of things that we have
10:27 heard over time that people have
10:30 speculated upon so let me see if I can
10:32 just address it head-on a tip ended in
10:35 2012 well I think it's pretty clear that
10:37 didn't happen
10:39 a tip found nothing of significance not
10:43 true in fact I think the matter of fact
10:46 that we even have the five observables
10:48 and and we can have an honest
10:50 conversation about the physics shows
10:52 that we did achieve something and when I
10:55 say we folks I'm not saying me
10:57 Luise Elizondo I'm talking about the
10:59 fantastic human beings I left behind at
11:02 the Department of Defense those are the
11:04 true heroes those are the folks that
11:06 still remain back there anonymous
11:08 working day-in day-out making this
11:11 happen so
11:12 a tip did find a lot of things of
11:17 significance a tip was a political favor
11:21 let's get this straight
11:23 by the way for the record I'm a
11:25 political I don't care if you're
11:26 Republican Democrat independent don't
11:28 know don't care
11:29 my job is to serve whoever is in charge
11:33 at the time my job is also to serve you
11:36 the American people the taxpayer you
11:38 employ me so therefore my loyalty is to
11:41 you as a result people will say well
11:45 this was something that Senator Reid did
11:47 as a favor to his one of his
11:49 constituents Bob Bigelow
11:50 I saw this process work
11:53 by the way Bigelow Aerospace was chosen
11:56 by none other than dia and by the way a
11:59 formal contract selection committee the
12:04 senator had nothing to do with it in
12:06 fact he could not get involved with it
12:08 so I think that's important distinction
12:12 because people in the absence of
12:15 information in that void we as human
12:18 beings have a tendency to fill that void
12:21 with either what we know what we think
12:24 and even sometimes what we don't know so
12:28 I want to make sure it's very clear that
12:29 it was not a political there was a
12:31 bipartisan effort by both Democrats and
12:34 Republicans all of them served their
12:36 country honorably all of them had served
12:38 in the military senator in a way
12:41 literally gave his right arm for his
12:43 country senator Stevens what is now
12:46 coming to light actually witnessed one
12:49 of these things when he was a pilot so I
12:53 think I think we're gonna have a
12:56 conversation about political favors we
12:58 at least need to speak truth to power
13:00 when we have that conversation a tip was
13:04 only academic yeah we produce a lot of
13:06 academic studies and we commissioned a
13:08 hell of a lot of reports
13:10 but that's not all a tip was involved
13:15 with actually speaking with individuals
13:17 collecting electro-optical data
13:19 collecting radar data talking to the
13:22 eyewitnesses and these eyewitnesses are
13:23 people keep in mind to have security
13:25 clearances they are trained observers in
13:27 some cases we have spent millions of
13:29 dollars into their training whether
13:32 special operations whether their pilots
13:34 were their intelligence officers they
13:36 have been paid to be critical thinkers
13:38 and they have been trained to look at a
13:40 silhouette and determine if that's a
13:41 mig-25 a mig-29 it's in a 90 degree roll
13:44 and it's at 200 kilometres in front of
13:46 me traveling at 200 knots these are some
13:54 of the data points that we use when
13:57 collecting the data and and analyzing
14:00 this information a tip leaked the videos
14:03 okay first of all let's go into a quick
14:06 legal definition of quote/unquote
14:08 leaking leaking means you take
14:09 classified information and you provide
14:11 it in an unauthorized manner it goes out
14:14 to the public
14:15 that's a leak that is not the case first
14:19 of all these videos went through a
14:22 proper classification review process the
14:26 documentation at some point will
14:28 probably come out I'm not going to
14:30 provide it that's not my job you want to
14:32 get it from the government they released
14:33 it
14:34 they released they authorized I mean let
14:36 me get this written it may authorize the
14:38 release of those videos and they did it
14:42 in writing now why they did it you have
14:45 to bring it up to them I know the
14:47 purposes that we wanted for them to come
14:49 out and that was to establish an
14:51 unclassified community of interest that
14:53 everybody could be part of and look at
14:55 and say hey I saw something like that
14:56 too but no one leaked
15:01 these videos if that was a case I would
15:04 be in a orange jumpsuit right now and I
15:06 do not look good in orange so believe me
15:11 okay a tip is a ploy for the
15:13 administration's new space force I don't
15:17 know where to begin with that
15:19 no now could it be used to bolster that
15:25 argument sure okay
15:27 in the end if it helps us go ahead use
15:30 it I don't care I think that's great you
15:32 want to say that that the UAP studies is
15:35 now helping us create a space force so
15:37 we can go ahead and look at this problem
15:38 seriously sign me up
15:40 sure again here we go into the to the to
15:46 the habit of filling in information
15:49 voids with things that we don't know I
15:53 don't know why the administration is
15:55 creating a space force maybe it's a good
15:58 idea maybe it's not such a good idea I
16:00 don't know I think ultimately it's up to
16:03 voters to decide you make the decision
16:06 if it is or not but I will tell you if
16:08 our humble little program a tip helped
16:12 inform that decision and they are going
16:15 to come back and fund this program in a
16:18 robust manner where we're gonna look at
16:20 it logically we're gonna look at it with
16:22 the best scientists and intelligence
16:24 officers and critically really look at
16:26 this I mean alternative analysis healthy
16:29 skepticism but but of course alternative
16:32 analysis if it's gonna help that let's
16:36 do it
16:36 sure so so what's happening now why are
16:46 we here well why are we all here
16:49 the conversation has finally moved folks
16:52 from the fringe so congratulations you
16:56 succeeded if you were to ask me eight
16:59 months ago that I'd be standing up here
17:00 and having this conversation and
17:01 briefing you this no way I'd say were
17:06 five years away from even getting close
17:08 to this
17:09 so my how things have moved so quickly
17:11 now I understand people are impatient
17:13 I'm impatient my daughter will tell you
17:15 if she's right here in the audience I'm
17:16 I'm impatient I don't like to wait I
17:18 want my information now but as I've told
17:20 people before there's a difference
17:22 beginning between giving you information
17:27 right versus giving you information
17:30 right
17:32 they're not always necessarily the same
17:34 I'd rather give you information right
17:37 versus right now so it is important that
17:42 we do our due diligence it's important
17:43 that when we are looking at the data
17:45 that we analyze it we quantify it we
17:46 qualify and do all the things necessary
17:48 so by the time we presented take a court
17:50 of law right you don't want a chief
17:51 prosecutor talking to the jury with a
17:54 half-baked case that's a dereliction of
17:56 duty it is incumbent as their
17:58 professional responsibility to make sure
18:00 they get it right and here is the data
18:03 as best as we know it to be as of now so
18:06 don't look now people are now having a
18:08 conversation over the dinner table
18:09 mainstream media has talked about this
18:11 several times they're getting it takes a
18:16 little while but they're having a
18:17 conversation and now all these people's
18:19 hey we thought you guys were crazy oh
18:20 maybe you're right
18:22 so we've come a long way a tip focus
18:26 areas remain relevant still to both
18:28 national security and to humanity that's
18:32 why we're here right I'd like to talk
18:34 about that for a minute
18:35 national security well if you have
18:37 something that can fly in and out of
18:38 your airspace undetected you can't stop
18:40 it you don't know how it works is that a
18:43 threat I don't know is it a threat the
18:45 fact that we can't answer that we have
18:47 to presume there's a possibility could
18:49 be a threat and I would submit to you
18:51 you want us to think that way that is
18:54 national security
18:56 you don't want us assuming that
18:58 something is not a threat without all
19:00 the data points that is not what we pay
19:02 the Department of Defense to do humanity
19:06 relevant to humanity I don't know the
19:09 impact this has to humanity and what we
19:12 should do about it
19:13 that's a decision you all need to make
19:15 my job simple collect the truth tell the
19:19 truth that's it
19:20 the heavy lifting here is you all
19:21 because you're the ones that have to
19:24 tell national leadership what you want
19:25 you're the ones that vote you're the
19:27 ones that that sit there and call
19:29 congressmen and Senators and say I want
19:31 action right so I think I think the
19:36 effects on humanity is is it does have
19:38 effect but but ultimately that story is
19:40 still being written and how that story
19:42 ends is really
19:44 on you TTS a and others are creating the
19:49 environment for elements within the
19:50 executive and legislative branch to have
19:52 the discussion people have asked what
19:54 are you doing well we're doing what we
19:55 can
19:56 does T TSA have contacts and connections
19:59 probably but I also understand the need
20:04 for privacy I also understand and
20:07 respect the need to give people an
20:10 operational safe space to collect
20:13 information and make an informed
20:15 decision without necessarily unnecessary
20:20 political pressure we have to give
20:23 people trade space time will be
20:27 necessary to allow leadership proper
20:29 awareness and assessment you cannot
20:31 digest a seven-course meal in ten
20:34 minutes folks
20:36 it takes time you've had some of you had
20:40 decades involved in this so what you
20:43 know to be a fact people are just now
20:46 hearing it for the very first time as
20:48 crazy as that may seem it's true for
20:52 some folks the the article that came out
20:54 in the New York Times is the very first
20:56 time they've ever actually even
20:58 considered this topic let alone our
21:02 leadership let alone our lawmakers so I
21:07 think I think you are well on the way of
21:11 getting what you're seeking I think we
21:13 have tremendous momentum like never
21:16 before now is not the time to throttle
21:19 back now is the time to push the
21:21 throttle all the way for that's what I
21:23 think if you are looking for government
21:28 to give you acknowledgement and just
21:30 give you full disclosure I'll tell you
21:35 right here and now the government's job
21:37 is not to satisfy idle curiosity that's
21:40 not the function of the government I
21:42 know we want it to be but that's not the
21:44 case the purpose of the government is to
21:46 defend this country from all enemies
21:49 foreign and domestic
21:50 now if there's information out there
21:52 that could be helpful in doing so
21:54 they're going to be involved and if
21:57 there's information
21:57 out there that doesn't really relate to
21:59 this to that mission but could be
22:01 helpful to us well that's where we get
22:03 involved that's that's that's how how we
22:05 can help organizations like TTS say are
22:09 developing initiatives like the
22:11 community of interest data repositories
22:13 and information sharing information
22:16 sharing don't think of it as just being
22:18 here information sharing is
22:21 international it is global as we have
22:24 seen before there's many nations here
22:26 represented that is exactly what we need
22:30 to continue to do both as a society and
22:34 as a government so in my opinion anyways
22:41 I think getting over the finish line if
22:45 there's really such thing as a finish
22:47 line there might not be this might be an
22:50 enduring effort and if you're looking
22:52 for the satisfaction that I can say I
22:54 made it that day may never come maybe it
22:58 does but that may never come maybe the
23:00 satisfaction of knowing that people can
23:02 finally have the conversation at the
23:04 dinner table that you can turn on CNN or
23:06 Fox News or BBC or what else and people
23:08 are having conversations with reputable
23:10 experts and they're funding programs to
23:13 look into it
23:13 maybe that's success I mean we all have
23:17 a different definition of what success
23:18 is right my my purpose here was simply
23:22 to give you a broad overview
23:24 I am confident and I am cautiously
23:27 optimistic that in the next year we're
23:34 going to have a fundamentally different
23:35 conversation than we're having today I
23:38 think there's going to be additional
23:40 fidelity to to a lot of the things that
23:44 have come out recently that are going to
23:47 help us have a better understanding of
23:50 what it is we're actually seeing here

02:07 she was a fantastic agent and I'm sure
02:09 she's a she's a fantastic officer now
02:10 and then I would also like to thank mr.
02:14 Alejandro Rojas and his a very lovely
02:17 wife over here these folks are kind of
02:22 the Mavericks in their field and despite
02:25 until recently a lot of the stigma that
02:29 you all know surround this portfolio
02:31 they continue to do their jobs day in
02:34 and day out and that says a lot I would
02:36 also like to very quick just a quick
02:38 show of hands if you're comfortable
02:39 those who have ever served either in
02:42 military or worked with the US
02:44 government or are working with the US
02:45 government in any capacity at all
02:48 anybody at all quite a few people I want
02:51 to thank you sincerely for your service
02:53 it is truly humbling thank you so very
02:56 much and then of course last but not
02:59 least an individual who I did not know I
03:01 only heard about her today
03:03 I apologize for my ignorance but it is
03:05 the passing of Miss Karen King that is
03:08 that is very certainly very unfortunate
03:11 and sad news to hear and especially for
03:14 somebody who had contributed much to
03:16 this field so I would like to I would
03:22 like to also offer my condolences
03:23 sincerely to her family unfortunately
03:27 this is so before I change any slides
03:32 here I would also like to thank you all
03:35 last but not least certainly but not
03:37 least you're really the reason why we're
03:41 here
03:41 folks I Cal myself others because you
03:45 all have been pursuing something that I
03:49 only did for the last decade somebody
03:52 you have invested 30 40 even 15 years of
03:56 your life and that is one hell of a
03:59 commitment that is our marriage so I
04:03 want to I want to tell you sincerely
04:05 from from from myself and from Howell
04:07 and others thank you very much for for
04:10 your commitment and I'm very hopeful
04:13 that forums like this are going to
04:17 continue to bring this conversation to
04:19 light so with no further review let me
04:22 go ahead and see if I figured this out
04:24 it I have to preface this Hooked on
04:26 Phonics did not work for me too well
04:28 kind of limited from an automation
04:30 perspective so let's see if it works
04:32 okay
04:37 a lot of people ask me so do you think
04:40 disclosure has occurred and I think it
04:45 has occurred and I think it is still
04:46 occurring as I said before I believe
04:48 this is a process it's not an event
04:51 I'm also asked well is this confirmation
04:55 well what does that mean because if you
04:59 look at the word confirmation that kind
05:01 of gives the impression that there's
05:03 some sort of underlying narrative to
05:04 begin with that you're confirming and
05:07 I'm not sure we have that narrative yet
05:10 I think we need more data I think we're
05:13 in the process of building that
05:14 narrative and we do that using the
05:16 scientific method and collecting
05:18 evidence and materials and doing the
05:20 proper analysis on this in a way that is
05:23 is can be peer reviewed and of course
05:26 we're capable right that's what science
05:27 is all about
05:28 so is this confirmation in my opinion
05:31 and I'm gonna caveat that might it's
05:33 only my opinion and I don't like you dip
05:34 it very often I don't think this is
05:36 confirmation because I don't think we
05:38 have a narrative yet and a very wary of
05:40 going down any Avenue where we have some
05:43 preconceived notion of what something
05:44 might or might not be already and so we
05:47 have enough evidence to establish the
05:49 facts so December 16th you all know
05:54 better than I do what happened the news
05:57 got out and and everybody everybody was
06:00 talking about it I would like to share
06:03 with you some personal insight I
06:05 received a call from a very dear
06:07 colleague of mine who's still at the
06:08 Pentagon who works this effort very very
06:11 closely and so yes read between the
06:14 lines when they say it's working this I
06:15 don't mean in the past actively working
06:18 distant so that means that continues so
06:21 congratulations
06:21 it's still going and and that too will
06:25 come out hopefully in a very official
06:27 way sometime soon but I received a call
06:29 from him very very recently and actually
06:31 it was this week and he said you know
06:33 Lou it's funny because a conversation
06:35 that I had to have with you just a year
06:37 and a half ago in a vault within a skin
06:41 in a tea SSCI facility that stopped
06:44 cleared and we had the whisper to have
06:46 conversation I can now have this
06:48 conversation in the open halls of the
06:49 Pentagon imagine that how far we've come
06:52 good and so as we sit here today I
06:55 encourage you look around look at all
06:57 these pictures around you you're right
06:59 now and at the epicenter of where
07:02 mankind as a species left this planet
07:06 and went somewhere else went to the moon
07:09 I was looking at some of these pictures
07:11 that profound in one picture you have a
07:13 dirt road with a few Model T's and
07:15 people walking along in dusty roads just
07:17 40 years later 40 years later you have
07:20 someone also walking on a dusty road but
07:24 it's not on this planet it's on the moon
07:25 and he's in a spacesuit so things happen
07:31 and and because of people like you and
07:33 the scientific community science fiction
07:36 becomes science fact and so anybody who
07:40 would look at you with some sort of
07:42 maybe tilt the smile or something like
07:44 that and say oh you talk about UFOs what
07:46 does that mean well we don't know what
07:49 it means but you should probably pay
07:51 attention because it is real now what it
07:54 is and how what's intentions all these
07:56 other things well that's for smarter
07:58 people than me to figure out that's
08:00 beyond me but we have established the
08:02 fact that they're real and we have also
08:04 established the fact that from a
08:06 national security perspective but we'll
08:08 talk about this and there some people
08:09 are a little bit leery of the fact that
08:11 I I've always historically tied this to
08:14 it to a a national security threat and
08:17 we'll get to that but you now have
08:21 people at the highest levels of the
08:22 United States government and
08:24 international communities of their
08:26 governments finally taking this serious
08:29 upon real resources real talents real
08:33 expertise to look at this and finally
08:36 figure out what this means
08:38 so congratulations I think this is a
08:43 historic event for everybody to have a
08:46 forum like this where everybody can sit
08:48 down and have an honest conversation
08:50 about a topic that has been
08:54 so fraud before with with skepticism and
08:59 taboo you've achieved a lot keep in mind
09:02 just ten years ago scientists still
09:04 couldn't agree whether or not the giant
09:06 squid of the Pacific really even existed
09:07 because I saw one on camera and so
09:11 finally enough washed up on a beach and
09:13 enough showed up on deep sea cameras
09:16 where now we realize oh you know what
09:18 there really are sea monsters in the
09:20 ocean but they're actually a species
09:23 it's actually a part of nature it's not
09:26 suicide it's is just science and so my
09:31 time at the Pentagon working with some
09:33 fantastic human beings like how food off
09:35 and others we approach this very much
09:39 the same way we approach this from a
09:41 scientific perspective we wanted to know
09:44 what we could capture empirical with
09:46 empirical data qualify and quantify it
09:49 so that we can go ahead and take that
09:51 data and try to figure out what it is
09:54 we're dealing with and so that's really
09:56 it in a nutshell this this occurred and
09:59 my intention for for leaving the
10:01 Department of Defense I would also like
10:03 to clarify it was not a matter of
10:05 disloyalty it was in fact loyalty why I
10:07 left the Department of Defense in the
10:09 first place I am very very loyal to the
10:12 Department of Defense if you look at my
10:14 resignation memo one of the very last
10:16 things I told secretary mattis you can
10:18 always count on me to carry the water
10:20 for DoD I love my country I love the
10:23 Department of Defense I believe in what
10:25 we're trying to accomplish but in order
10:29 for me to accomplish and finish the very
10:32 mission I was given by the way which I
10:35 did not ask for I actually had to leave
10:37 my beloved department to finish that
10:40 mission so if anybody has any
10:43 speculation out there why I left I did
10:47 not leave in bad blood I left because I
10:51 had to because it was the only way I was
10:53 going to be able to get the boss when I
10:55 was well - who I serve in combat with to
10:58 be able to pay attention because certain
11:00 people that were minding him were not
11:03 providing him
11:04 information and in my opinion the only
11:06 thing more dangerous to a country keep
11:09 in mind that Department of Defense
11:11 mission is to protect its national
11:12 borders the only thing more dangerous
11:15 than our ability not to protect our
11:17 national borders and our people is not
11:19 to be able to have a conversation that
11:21 that threat exists and that was my that
11:24 is what I objected to we couldn't even
11:27 have a conversation about it because of
11:29 social stigma and that is wrong so that
11:33 is why I chose to leap and of course a
11:37 lot of speculation came out as a result
11:39 of that am i a spy for the CIA trying to
11:44 fool people and do soft disclosure as
11:46 I've said before look at the end of the
11:48 day I'll tell you now but it is really
11:50 matter because people gonna believe what
11:51 they believe intimidate who cares
11:52 because we're getting what we wanted
11:54 you're getting the information that was
11:56 so squirreled away in these little
11:58 secret hidden compartments it's now
12:00 coming to life you're now realizing
12:02 we're looking at aircraft forty years in
12:04 the future because if you look at 40 12:06 years ago in the past what do we have we
12:08 have f-16s we have f-14 Tomcats we had F
12:11 Wars what do we have today we have f-18s
12:14 we have f-16 we have F twenty-twos we
12:17 have f-117 but they're still Jets when
12:20 you look at the DEA studies I think it's
12:23 very evident what we were looking at
12:24 we're looking at aircraft forty years in
12:27 the future we're going to get into a
12:28 little that right now so this was the
12:32 a-10 contract focus and I also want to
12:35 go a little bit into what it means and
12:38 you have you sit up here
12:39 aerospace we're not talking about
12:41 aviation we're not talking about
12:43 airplanes we're talking about things
12:45 that have the ability to operate both in
12:48 an atmosphere environment and no
12:50 atmosphere environment and you know what
12:52 probably underwater - why is that
12:55 important because these things are being
12:57 able to move to perform in a way that we
13:01 still don't quite yet understand we
13:03 certainly cannot replicate more
13:05 importantly they can do it in all
13:07 virtual mediums so let me digress for
13:11 just one moment here
13:13 and do a very brief and I don't want to
13:15 solve anybody's intelligence I know
13:16 pretty much everybody in this room knows
13:18 more about physics than I do but as it
13:21 was explained to me let's say this pen
13:24 here is a aircraft and their craft looks
13:28 like an aircraft because it has to
13:30 perform in our atmosphere
13:32 so it hasn't notice it's got a tail it's
13:34 got wings it's got control surfaces
13:37 it's got an engine in the back so
13:38 playing pretty much looks like a plane
13:40 yeah I make me of me too
13:42 versus an f-16 but it still is a plane
13:45 whereas a rocket it doesn't have to fly
13:49 really for very much time in our
13:50 atmosphere it's in no atmosphere so it
13:53 has thrusters doesn't have wings some
13:55 time control services as thrusters as
13:57 chemical rocket motors instead of a jet
14:00 engine because there's no atmosphere and
14:02 you have a submarine it was completely
14:04 different it actually uses buoyancy and
14:06 a propeller to move underwater and
14:07 that's why submarine looks like a
14:09 submarine a plane would send a plane and
14:11 a rock that looks like a rocket for the
14:13 most part yet these things we're seeing
14:15 can operate in all these environments
14:17 without changing their physical
14:19 attributes and still continue to perform
14:22 the same way now for those of you who
14:24 are scientists you know the drag
14:26 coefficients we're talking about when
14:28 you're in water you look at a torpedo
14:30 and I can't go into details here but
14:32 anything above a moderate speed
14:35 underwater the drag becomes so
14:39 significant that it's almost impossible
14:42 to overcome unless you use other
14:45 technologies to reduce that friction and
14:49 yet these things can perform just as
14:53 easy we pick them up on radar we take
14:55 them up on sonar and we pick them up
14:57 with everything in between this was a
15:00 contract focus I've talked about this
15:02 before but this came out back more than
15:07 a year ago before the list of dia
15:10 studies was ever released and this is
15:12 actual from the contract why is that
15:14 important because a word phenomena is
15:16 used doesn't say aircraft folks
15:18 it says phenomena it's in black and
15:21 white we can read it yourself in the
15:23 contour
15:24 black-and-white every word that we use
15:27 is deliberate in the US government you
15:29 know that from a contract vehicle
15:30 perspective if you've ever been a core
15:32 contract officers representative you
15:34 know what I'm talking about
15:35 words have meaning they have legal
15:37 meaning so when you see that
15:39 investigating legitimacy of currently
15:41 observed phenomena investigate that
15:44 doesn't mean just to study spoke sense
15:46 as we sit back with a stubby pencil and
15:48 just collect data it's investigating
15:49 it's doing it's an action so and then
15:54 ask the question are they achievable by
15:56 current understanding of physics and
15:57 engineering well if there are craft than
16:00 the answer is yes unless they're not and
16:05 then it says at the bottom if not what
16:07 research is required to achieve it well
16:09 those are the studies that mr. Pugh
16:10 talked helped get done for us and
16:13 several other very very very renowned
16:16 scientists some of the best in the world
16:20 in their fields mind you so that's why
16:23 you have those studies that came out and
16:25 again it says in black and white
16:28 phenomena does not say aircraft so
16:32 anybody who tries to twist that
16:34 narrative I would encourage you to do a
16:36 little reading or encourage them to do a
16:38 little reading because it's in black and
16:40 white
16:45 so this is a slide to put out before but
16:49 I can probably talk a little bit more
16:50 now about it because all these studies
16:52 came out so let me briefly go over what
16:56 are the five observables work okay
16:59 you're talking about an object here's
17:01 our little airplane again the first
17:05 observables is sudden and instantaneous
17:07 acceleration what we're talking about
17:10 are the inertial forces that are that
17:13 are exhibited by something when it
17:15 changes direction from point a to point
17:17 being possibly back to a again or Z or
17:19 whatever there are internal inertial
17:21 forces that we can look at and we can
17:24 actually measure to determine is this
17:27 something that we know them so to put
17:29 this in context the human body can
17:31 withstand for a very short period of
17:33 time about nine G's wearing a jisu
17:35 otherwise very unpleasant things start
17:37 to happen
17:38 blackouts rad outs are cetera and that's
17:41 sixteen I'll be it a little bit older
17:43 aircraft anybody here from General
17:45 Dynamics well anyways great oh crap
17:48 little older still one of the most
17:49 highly maneuverable aircraft we've ever
17:51 built except a few experimental ones but
17:54 they were unmanned so and that aircraft
17:56 could go anywhere between 16 to 18 G's
18:00 before the material science aspect of
18:03 the aircraft begins to break down
18:05 meaning wing wing' snap off okay there
18:09 are other things missiles that can
18:13 experience much greater g-forces for a
18:15 very short period of time again a very
18:18 short period but what we're seeing is a
18:20 consistent and a persistent ability to
18:23 perform g-forces well in excess of 400 18:25 genes and that's on the conservative
18:28 side well beyond the healthy limitations
18:31 of anything biological is certain to a
18:32 standing and by the way this is not
18:35 world according to them this is this is
18:36 actually documented it's been recorded
18:38 it's real you can see it yourself and
18:40 the Nimitz is just one of many many
18:43 examples that I'm fairly certain are
18:45 going to come to light really soon the
18:48 next one is hypersonic velocity so
18:51 here's our little airplane again flying
18:53 in the atmosphere and everybody doesn't
18:55 supersonic speeds our Bobo you're
18:57 talking hypersonic velocity they're
18:59 talking about Mach 5 plus that's really
19:01 fast but now do we have aircraft that
19:03 can do it sure Hank the Space Shuttle
19:05 did that I was going in chaining orbital
19:07 velocity but not the way we're seeing it
19:11 and certainly not without the Associated
19:13 signatures when you seen the shuttle
19:15 launch baby you know it's the shuttle I
19:17 mean it's loud you see a smoke plume for
19:20 miles and miles and miles earth shakes
19:22 when an aircraft is doing that kind of
19:25 speed or a missile you have heat
19:28 ablation and friction you have
19:30 atmospheric ionization you have
19:32 contrails at the back they have acoustic
19:34 signatures such as sonic booms that are
19:38 very hard to get around an engineer
19:40 around it okay that's why you have
19:43 something like the b2 it's really
19:45 stealthy but it's not really fast if you
19:48 want to be really fast you're probably
19:49 not going to be really stealthy so it's
19:51 a trade-off that these things are
19:54 performing hypersonic velocity in some
19:56 cases have to be careful icing what I
20:01 will tell you is that they have been
20:03 officially clocked at over 13,000 miles
20:06 an hour unofficially much much faster
20:09 and by the way these are through through
20:13 military capabilities okay
20:15 not grandma saw some lights in the
20:17 backyard the third observable is a
20:22 little bit of an oxymoron low
20:24 observability right well it is believe
20:27 it or not the fact that you can't see it
20:29 sometimes is something that you can
20:32 record sometimes the absence of data
20:34 itself is just as important as having
20:38 data if you see a hole in the picture
20:40 that means something's creating that
20:42 hole and very much the same way here
20:45 you'll have the reports of the pilots
20:47 eye witnesses by the way highly trained
20:50 observers all with top-secret security
20:53 clearances by the way trusted to fly
20:56 live munitions over US cities going
20:58 fight
20:59 have these these people are trained to
21:02 know the silhouette between the mig-25 a
21:04 mig-29 and f-16 in the European Toronado
21:06 they know it they know they different
21:09 between a drone a quadcopter and a kite
21:11 and they're telling you what they're
21:12 seeing is unlike anything they've ever
21:14 seen before but oh wait there's more
21:16 because what they're reporting and
21:18 saying you know it's this weird kind of
21:19 silvery object it's hard to see is also
21:22 being backed up on the electro optical
21:23 data the cameras are seeing that same
21:25 fuzzy weird object - with this weird
21:28 glowing aura this halo around him and oh
21:31 by the way it happens to be the same
21:32 thing that the radar is picking up -
21:35 simultaneously and not just one radar
21:37 many radars at the same time from
21:39 different positions okay so they have
21:42 spatial and temporal data coming in oh I
21:45 think that probably you guys know okay
21:50 so you have spatial and temporal
21:51 information all now coming together
21:54 telling you that you've got something
21:57 there may I know what it is hard to see
21:59 it but maybe that the fact that it's
22:01 hard to see in itself as an observable
22:03 domain it's telling you something
22:04 there's some physics there right and you
22:08 look at the desert a hot desert update
22:10 you see that Mirage effect it's kind of
22:12 hard to see through are we looking at
22:15 something similar and of course that you
22:18 can see on the right these are some of
22:19 the reasons why it's important for us
22:20 from UM from a DoD perspective a
22:23 military perspective a national security
22:25 perspective because if I can do
22:27 instantaneous acceleration of hypersonic
22:29 velocity of low observability that gives
22:31 me the ability to understand thrust
22:33 vectoring capabilities g-force
22:35 neutralization rapid deployment of a
22:39 capability first strike capability right
22:41 so if I can go ahead and hit my enemy
22:44 before they hit mean and that's probably
22:46 better and then of course stealth low
22:50 observability the other two observables
22:53 multi-medium travel and pause and
22:54 political talk very briefly about that -
22:56 I apologize on the right if it's hard to
22:58 seeing those I didn't get a chance when
23:01 I was going between PC and Mac
23:04 and back and forth on this it dropped
23:06 the color but though they're supposed to
23:07 be a multi medium travel we talked
23:10 briefly about that an object that can
23:11 perform just as easily in atmosphere
23:13 low-earth orbit possibly beyond and even
23:16 under water now why would that be
23:19 important for us
23:20 well strategic surprise military
23:23 flexibility battle space dominance I can
23:27 fly I can swim and I can do everything
23:28 in between that's huge but that again
23:32 goes to a world of compromises when
23:34 we're talking from an engineering
23:35 perspective for example when you look at
23:37 a seaplane right that's a plane that can
23:40 fly but it can also kind of be like a
23:41 boat but a seaplane isn't really you
23:44 know it's it's an amalgamation of
23:46 compromises it's not really a great
23:48 airplane and it's not really a great
23:51 boat it's just kind of in the middle
23:52 there because it's got a satisfying boat
23:54 so there are these compromises we don't
23:56 see those compromises when we're looking
23:58 at the UAP why is that and then of
24:02 course positive lift the ability to
24:04 define the natural effects of Earth's
24:07 gravitational force by the way
24:10 universally applies to us all and we
24:14 have technology sure I mean we have hot
24:17 air balloons that's positive lift we
24:19 have lift wings right like an aircraft
24:22 you have the four the four coefficient
24:25 you have to pay attention to thrust lift
24:27 drag weight you have a jet engine that
24:32 can provide that thrust you have a
24:34 propeller engine that's kind of a
24:35 mechanical way of pushing the air if you
24:37 will and then you have rocket engines
24:39 chemical engines but really those are
24:41 only the four real ways we know how to
24:43 how to defy for any real good time
24:47 Earth's natural gravitational force
24:48 other than ballistic right like a mortar
24:51 or just popping this a lot of them out
24:52 of a silo
24:53 yeah these things can fly these credible
24:57 speeds and yet hover like a helicopter
24:59 sometimes for a minute sometimes for
25:01 hours sometimes for days they can drop
25:05 in from 80,000 feet down to 50 feet
25:07 right over the water within less than
25:09 a couple seconds seconds you tell me I
25:18 mean I I was part of a lot of government
25:22 programs I have a good healthy
25:24 background in aerospace and protecting
25:26 technologies advanced technologies when
25:28 I was a young special agent we still
25:32 don't have that capability so you can
25:36 see from a national security perspective
25:37 there are national security implications
25:39 to this now if you ask me as a human
25:42 being is a national security threat I
25:45 think my answer to you would be could be
25:47 able wanted to be it has the potential
25:49 to be I'm not saying they're a threat
25:53 what I'm saying is that they could mean
25:55 if they wanted to be or it could be if
25:58 it wanted to be so as a result you pay
26:03 in your department of defense to protect
26:06 this country from all enemies foreign
26:07 and domestic
26:08 that's what it says so you you want a
26:11 Department of Defense to consider this a
26:14 potential national security threat until
26:16 it can prove it's not so that's why in
26:19 my job look if this was a humanitarian
26:20 thing and everybody was here for peace
26:22 and sing Kumbaya give it to the State
26:24 Department give it to an NGO and until
26:26 USAID that's not DoD's job even whose
26:29 job is to go fight and win wars quickly
26:31 that is what you paid us to do and so
26:35 that is why there was a national
26:37 security Nexus because if there's
26:39 anything other than national security
26:41 the DoD would not be involved the Air
26:43 Force wouldn't be involved maybe
26:45 wouldn't be involved most likely the CIA
26:48 would be involved dia and everybody else
26:50 it is any national security issue is it
26:54 a threat I don't know but it is an issue
26:57 in my opinion
27:04 but you know what that this effort
27:08 didn't start with agent and I know that
27:11 and you know that a tip was just one
27:15 piece of a long legacy of efforts that
27:18 some people in this room were actually
27:21 part of how incredible is that right so
27:24 here we are today and we're going all
27:25 the way back some some folks in this
27:27 room we're actually part of the project
27:29 Bluebook and that's something else these
27:35 are documents that were actually
27:37 released by these organizations that
27:40 talk about the same five observables in
27:42 fact going back to the 1950s earlier it
27:46 is 1952 to be precise officers described
27:50 seeing a flying white butane tank about
27:53 40 feet a flying lozenge what is that
27:57 someone to you somebody take that to me
28:00 and these observables go all the way
28:03 back to 1947 and they're written in some
28:07 cases by four-star officers they're
28:11 written to and from J Edgar Hoover as
28:14 high as it gets so don't look at a tip
28:20 and say well a tip frontal that sound
28:21 actually we didn't we just continued the
28:24 legacy of a lot of hard work
28:26 it goes well before that we have known
28:29 about these things for a long time the
28:30 only thing they did did with the help of
28:32 folks like Al was be able to understand
28:34 that these things fell into a category
28:35 of observables and them allowed us to
28:37 try to figure out the physics that is an
28:40 accomplishment of ancient unfortunate I
28:43 can't take credit for it the credit goes
28:44 to that guy but that is something that
28:47 this this office was able to achieve but
28:48 I do think that's significant because
28:50 once you understand the physics you
28:52 understand how it works if you
28:54 understand how it works then maybe you
28:56 can replicate it so I encourage you at
29:00 some time to take a look at some of
29:01 these documents very very interesting
29:04 again a lot of these are the recent FOIA
29:07 there's a lot of them I don't expect
29:09 everybody to digest all of it but
29:11 there's enough there where anybody can
29:13 look at
29:13 or even take these slides and blow up
29:15 and so you see some of these examples
29:16 they're pretty incredible I'm sure some
29:19 of you will do this anyway so everyone
29:21 always takes to the briefing they go
29:22 through a fine-tooth comb so I try to
29:24 put a couple of Easter eggs in there one
29:31 so there's a long history but you know
29:34 what it's not only the u.s. folks its
29:38 foreign governments they've got an
29:40 interest too and some of these countries
29:43 have actually admitted it for some
29:46 reason they're a little more forthcoming
29:47 than we are I don't know why I only
29:50 imagine why but these are some of the
29:53 organizations that are actually within
29:55 their governments that are actually
29:58 charter specifically to look at you a
30:03 piece from a scientific perspective
30:05 minded so you're talking about money
30:08 resources and budgets and personnel it
30:11 could be diverted to like things like
30:12 war on terrorism but they're not they're
30:14 diverted to the UAP phenomena because
30:16 they think it's important enough that
30:18 they understand what they're dealing
30:19 with and frankly I don't blame you but
30:21 guess what it's not just that here's
30:25 some more countries so I think what we
30:30 have this conversation we're beginning
30:31 to realize that this is not a u.s.
30:34 phenomenon this is not even a phenomena
30:38 for this hemisphere it is truly a global
30:41 phenomenon there's a gentleman I've met
30:43 me here from Peru and you know what they
30:48 had one hell of an effort a lot of
30:52 interesting things about what happens in
30:53 and in the South America how and I have
30:56 had a briefing one individual in
30:59 particular from a country down south a
31:02 very senior first I still remember that
31:03 that debriefing very very compelling and
31:07 it was an official US government
31:09 deviation by the way so yeah there's a
31:14 history here and this is a this is a
31:16 global phenomenon so why why would we
31:19 look at it I mean our friends are
31:21 looking at it some of our foreign
31:22 adversaries are looking
31:23 yeah sure you should look no there's two
31:27 things I'd like to before go to the next
31:29 slide
31:29 talk about just briefly national
31:33 security threat
31:34 I heard someone else say this a far more
31:35 eloquently but let me see Mike it would
31:37 catch here very quickly hypothetically
31:41 sir senator so-and-so Lou do you think
31:46 this is really I mean really at the end
31:48 of it just really it's just really a
31:50 threat well sir mr. senator we have we
31:55 have two options and we have something
31:57 coming into our airspace that we have no
32:00 idea what it is how it works and there's
32:02 not a damn thing we can do about it and
32:04 oh by the way has a capability to bring
32:05 potentially nuclear capabilities over
32:08 the White House in two minutes or it's a
32:12 mass delusion everybody is absolutely
32:14 crazy
32:16 thousands of DoD people who have
32:18 top-secret clearances trained observers
32:20 whom you trust to go fight win the worth
32:21 with languages over your head since
32:24 they're crazy by the way some of these
32:26 people have their finger on the nuclear
32:27 button is that not also an issue so
32:31 either way it's a national security
32:32 issue doesn't matter what some gal
32:33 you're on doesn't matter how you feel
32:35 about it he doesn't match the training
32:36 issues those are the only two options
32:37 it's real or it's not neither one is a
32:39 national security issue so I think I
32:44 think it's important we we look at it
32:46 that way and so then the next options
32:48 well you know it's okay who the DoD
32:52 scratches are here to someone you know
32:53 actually we think it's Russia well okay
32:57 fine you know what
32:59 great so how long have you known DoD and
33:05 this was a Russian capability if you
33:07 failed to inform Congress which by the
33:10 way is wall what's your answer now
33:14 because okay grates Russians why would
33:16 you told me it's been how many years and
33:18 they've had this cake really the entire
33:19 time so
33:22 you see my pointer when you go down the
33:23 logic train it's really not that bit
33:26 illogical to have this conversation from
33:29 a national security perspective because
33:31 either way you look at it it is a
33:33 national security issue but with come
33:36 challenges also come opportunities we
33:41 are in a room now where we have some of
33:43 the greatest minds in this country
33:45 working together to put human beings on
33:50 the moon coming in today this morning I
33:54 was stunned to see a life-sized version
33:57 of the Saturn 5 rocket amazing amazing
34:03 one of the most powerful fastest
34:07 machines mankind has ever built ever is
34:13 standing right over there right in your
34:15 backyard and let's look at it what
34:19 happened during the last space race a
34:21 lot of things happen a lot of industries
34:25 came out of the last space race that we
34:29 couldn't even imagine so my humble
34:31 company along with Hal and several other
34:32 people like Chris melon Steve justice we
34:36 have a company that a lot of people kind
34:38 of say well are you ready to but now
34:41 you're doing this thing with GSA and
34:44 okay you're trying to build something
34:46 you're trying to study something you're
34:47 also selling books and t-shirts or I'm
34:50 confused okay well it's okay you can be
34:52 but it actually makes sense that's a
34:56 whole nother breathing but what I'm
34:57 gonna tell you these are kind of the
34:58 three divisions we have field operations
35:00 science and aerospace and education
35:02 entertainment now what the hell does
35:04 entertainment and a rock star have to do
35:06 with this
35:07 you've got a platform folks same reason
35:09 you're here today you're all coming here
35:11 to have a discussion and have a
35:12 conversation in order to do that you got
35:14 to get the word out having a rock star
35:18 in a musician and understands how to
35:21 push a message and there's a little bit
35:25 of a vanguard in maverick and doesn't
35:26 really care
35:27 breaking some of the rules that you guys
35:28 like need to worry about sometimes you
35:31 got to break a little China and he knows
35:33 how to break a lot of China you know
35:35 it's also an individual who got to the
35:37 highest levels of government whether
35:38 you're one admit it or not he got to the
35:41 desktop okay so we have to give credit
35:45 where credit is due
35:46 and part of this is like when spielberg
35:49 came out with his Close Encounters of
35:50 the Third Kind that was I think we can
35:54 look back and say wow that was actually
35:56 a very monumental movie it was done for
35:58 entertainment but it was a monument to
36:00 living and so you there are examples
36:03 where science fiction has actually
36:06 conformed science fact in science fact
36:09 has informed science fiction and that's
36:11 done in entertainment let's put an
36:13 example Gene Roddenberry Star Trek right
36:15 remember they had a little tricorder in
36:17 a little flip phone and all of a sudden
36:18 Motorola 30 years later folks
36:21 they talk about the trial or kind of
36:24 this thing that we're to look inside
36:25 your body now we've got cat scans
36:26 so those are some examples where site
36:30 fiction help inform science fact let's
36:32 look at some examples
36:33 where science fact informs of science
36:34 fiction in the entertainment industry
36:36 and then I won't think this too much
36:39 Apollo 13 36:41 a mission that almost became a national
36:44 tragedy and disaster but it wasn't it
36:50 was a miracle and 30 years later
36:54 yup Hollywood doing a movie with Ron
36:56 Howard as director on Apollo 13 right to
37:00 get that message out so no different
37:02 than anybody else trying to get their
37:04 message out no different than this
37:05 organization here we're trying to get
37:08 the conversation started and what you
37:11 saw in History Channel that is a start
37:14 you're talking about a global audience
37:16 of millions and millions of people we
37:18 can finally have the conversation and by
37:19 the way when people say on camera you
37:21 can't take it back once it's said once
37:23 it's recorded is there for posterity for
37:25 and bird so this is a way that we can
37:30 have that conversation and we can get
37:33 people to have a conversation people
37:36 with access
37:37 people with expertise people in the
37:41 government this is not a show by the way
37:45 if anybody wants to know how well you do
37:48 financially doing the show after seven
37:50 months like this traveling the world
37:51 that are naturally working your butt off
37:52 I made enough just ever put on the table
37:55 I made enough to buy a decent lawnmower
37:58 so I can now move my lawn and a
38:02 self-propelled one more so if you think
38:05 this is some get-rich-quick scheme it's
38:07 not folks it is I gotta go play the
38:10 lottery that better chances of making
38:11 more money doing that you do this
38:13 because you believe in it and once you
38:16 see it you can't forget it
38:18 so this is our humble company we talked
38:22 about some of the innovations that came
38:24 out profound innovations resulting from
38:27 the last space race well let's take a
38:30 look at a few portable life support
38:33 systems micro scanners remote medical
38:36 monitoring and sensors memory foam for
38:38 beds here's just a small few examples
38:41 let's look at a few more cosmic rays
38:43 shilling we now use them on our
38:45 satellites freeze-dried food I'm not
38:48 sure that was such a great envision
38:50 portable soil vacuum reflective foils we
38:53 use now for thermal insulation this goes
38:56 on and on right human prosthetics and
38:59 thank NASA actually there were over
39:01 6,300 innovations any of you have
39:07 athletic shoes and good workout or new
39:09 yoga follow any of you had a cat scan in
39:13 the last year all LED lights anybody who
39:17 has ever seen an LED light or uses LED
39:20 lights to try to save money in your
39:21 house Oh each one of these in some cases
39:27 trapped to a multi-billion dollar
39:29 industries and they had no idea NASA had
39:32 no idea what was going to come out of
39:35 the space race and here's just a small
39:37 example so guess what my opinion I think
39:40 we're at that paradigm again I think we
39:42 are at this paradigm where now we are
39:45 faced with the new reality
39:48 and society limit folks if you think
39:51 that's exciting wait to see what comes
39:53 out of this when you can manipulate
39:56 space tiny metric can you imagine what
40:01 type of what type of things we can do
40:03 for mankind in humanity and that's just
40:05 one so our company is is focused to a
40:11 great deal on the science piece in the
40:12 aerospace on looking at this as a as a
40:17 business case model that might work
40:25 alright so here's the slide everybody
40:27 wants to talk about so look all those
40:38 products that came out of the last base
40:40 range required material science
40:42 scientists in some cases like you that
40:44 are sitting in this room we need your
40:46 help you don't have the material you
40:47 know have the analysis you don't have
40:49 the data and got nothing
40:50 so this is why forums like yours are so
40:54 important you've gotta have scientists
40:58 at the end of the day to figure out just
41:00 what the hell it is we're looking at
41:02 what what makes this material so special
41:05 now in some cases this material was told
41:08 it's special through analysis guess what
41:11 yeah that's a special some of it is
41:15 absolutely special I will point out
41:18 which one isn't on that slide but there
41:21 are some that are absolutely special and
41:25 had been briefed to some very very
41:26 senior levels of this government and
41:28 they do remarkable and extraordinary
41:30 things and they're built in such a way
41:32 that to this day we still can't
41:34 replicate to this day
41:39 so that should be that should be very
41:41 telling material science is a critical
41:44 piece to this we can't just sit there
41:46 and say aha I told you so
41:48 that's not what this is about this is
41:51 not this effort is not about satisfying
41:53 the natural curiosity of people who want
41:55 to know right now as I've said before
41:57 there's a difference in giving
41:59 information right and giving it right
42:01 now I am not in the business of giving
42:04 information right now I'd rather give it
42:06 to you right so you have to do to
42:09 diligence you have to understand what it
42:13 takes to do the analysis and to respect
42:17 the scientific method and to respect the
42:19 people you're working with in government
42:21 whether it be the legislative branch or
42:22 the executive branch you've got to give
42:25 people time you have been steeped many
42:27 of you in this for decades some of these
42:29 people are learning about this for the
42:31 very first time no kidding
42:32 there's scratching so wait a minute
42:34 that's real that's real edge that so you
42:40 got to give them time and then they have
42:41 to make decisions because you can
42:44 imagine for something like this there's
42:45 all sorts of agencies and organizations
42:47 that have an interest in this I can't
42:50 tell you which ones unfortunately but
42:51 you can use your imagination and it's
42:53 not just propulsion there's other
42:55 organizations I can look at this you
42:57 know and say let's say from let's say
43:01 from a normal perspective right I put X
43:05 amount of pounds of armor on a vehicle
43:07 that slow me down and weigh me down what
43:10 if I didn't have to have armor at all
43:12 what if I had a way the certain material
43:15 where bullets didn't matter anymore
43:19 it didn't do anything to me
43:21 so we're taking this step by step I know
43:26 people are hungry for information you
43:28 know I do believe it's forthcoming but
43:32 it has to be done the right way and by
43:35 the way let me caveat that too because
43:37 people say what is the right way you're
43:38 away no it's not my way it's not my way
43:41 at all
43:44 but we have to respect the people that
43:46 are involved we have to give them the
43:50 flexibility and latitude to take this in
43:53 and start making the right decisions and
43:55 you want always make sure that your
43:57 executive branch and your legend
43:58 legislative branch are duly informed you
44:00 don't want one being informed and not
44:03 the other politics aside I want every
44:05 Republican Democrat independent you know
44:07 Tea Party don't I don't care the bottom
44:09 line is when you serve as a government
44:12 servant like I did it is our duty
44:14 responsibility to inform leadership and
44:16 the executive branch doesn't matter
44:18 who's in charge and in turn you also
44:21 have to make sure that the legislative
44:22 branch is also informed and you know
44:25 what one being more informed than the
44:26 other does then they get mad
44:29 so it takes time it takes time but now
44:33 let's recap very quickly the last year
44:36 and four months okay just very quickly
44:39 humor me for one moment
44:42 the New York Times came out and
44:44 published a story that the program was
44:46 real do you
44:48 it was real they said they spent 22 44:50 million dollars on three videos for the
44:53 first time in US government history were
44:56 released by the US government
44:58 through the actual review process on
45:00 objects that they still say to this day
45:03 they have no idea what they are and by
45:04 the way they were already analyzed so
45:06 please don't show me some sort of video
45:09 game that some put pulled off their PC
45:11 and say look that's IR flare it's not
45:12 even a real picture video game ok give
45:16 me real data we had the best of the best
45:19 from the intelligence community looking
45:20 at this that briefed me and they said
45:23 Lou we haven't a clue this is some weird
45:26 stuff and by the way you will see that
45:29 we even had people from NTSB on camera
45:34 analyzed on camera same thing bingo
45:40 not a clue 50 years of doing
45:44 investigations for the NTSB I've never
45:46 seen anything like that in my career for
45:49 the record on camera
45:51 so I think it's important as we build a
45:57 compelling case that we can tell keeping
45:59 in mind that even the brief I'm giving
46:01 you today there are going to be people
46:02 behaving in this audience but they're
46:04 gonna be people
46:05 if this goes out that are gonna
46:06 scrutinize every single word I say and
46:08 they are waiting for me to mess up one
46:11 wrong word that violates my NDA and I go
46:13 to jail you won't see Lou for a very
46:16 long time
46:18 so I have to be careful
46:20 I will not violate my NDA not because
46:22 I'm afraid of jail just because I'm a
46:25 patriot I don't want to tell you I love
46:27 my country so I'm not gonna violate but
46:29 I am gonna try to have a conversation in
46:32 a way that gets everybody involved and
46:35 that information comes to you in the
46:37 right way because it shouldn't be coming
46:38 from the a sentence on those shouldn't
46:40 be coming world according to Lou and
46:42 this is this is everything but it should
46:45 be coming through the government
46:46 channels the right channels because
46:48 ultimately that's why I really left the
46:50 Department of Defense I wanted to fix it
46:52 I didn't want to ruin it
46:54 these are good people both of those
46:56 people that are my friends our foxhole
46:58 ones in combat with they're good they're
47:00 they're loyal they're Patriots
47:01 yeah there's dysfunction in the
47:02 government I got it we all know there it
47:04 fits there but there's also a lot of
47:06 goodness and so I wanted to compel those
47:10 in leadership positions to fix the
47:12 system it's not any one individuals
47:15 fault now are there little cobol's in
47:17 there that made my life very difficult
47:19 yeah absolutely their work that's
47:22 another conversation but they were not
47:27 they did not represent the government
47:30 writ large and I think it's important
47:32 that I make that distinction and I want
47:35 the government to work to our benefit
47:37 now I'm a private citizen before I was a
47:40 serving other people now the government
47:42 serves me and I want to make sure it
47:43 works I want to make sure it's fixed and
47:46 so that's what we're doing so that's
47:48 really what my what my effort has been
47:51 the last year and a half and so if we've
47:52 been a little bit radio silence I
47:54 apologize for that it's not intentional
47:56 but there's a lot of things going on
47:57 behind the scenes just because you don't
47:59 see what's on top of the water there's a
48:01 whole lot going on
48:02 so I asked for a little bit of patience
48:05 and understanding what you've open very
48:07 patient and understanding I think good
48:10 things are coming I think good things
48:13 are coming this way you have a good meal
48:15 is scary for some people and maybe this
48:17 is a conversation that that is not only
48:19 involving scientists like you and the
48:21 curious but also maybe religious
48:23 scholars and philosophers and government
48:26 people and academics right why not bring
48:28 them into the mix because at the end of
48:30 the day I don't care for your doctor
48:32 you're a lawyer you're a cop you're a
48:34 fireman you're a schoolteacher you're a
48:37 student this phenomenon affects every
48:40 single one of us equally and how we
48:45 interpret this information they differ
48:47 depending where you come from and one of
48:50 your few one is what what review on is
48:52 in life but at the end of the day we're
48:55 all affected equally so we should
48:56 probably all have a conversation
48:57 together in my opinion anyways so with
49:03 that said let me go here and before we
49:07 go to questions real quick I would like
49:09 to just point out one last thing I was a
49:13 government bureaucrat I did some stuff
49:15 before in the intelligence community I
49:19 spent some time in some really bad
49:21 situations overseas but when I came to
49:24 this program I didn't ask to it it was
49:26 someone asked me because of my
49:28 background in counterintelligence to
49:29 take the job and so I did it
49:31 this is something that I went just now
49:33 but I'm gonna do it when they came to me
49:35 and they finally had a serious
49:36 conversation he asked me said Lou I want
49:38 to know what do you think about UFOs I
49:40 told him I don't don't think about it
49:42 don't know don't care I don't that time
49:44 to page I'm just I'm worried about the
49:46 enemy tell me where the enemy is and so
49:49 that's probably why I was brought on to
49:51 the beginning and then later the my the
49:54 the director who preceded me
49:57 unfortunately was run out of the US
49:59 government because of this very caustic
50:04 portfolio a lot of stigma and so people
50:08 like howl and others who we had to rely
50:12 upon a
50:13 that director and I took it over there
50:17 really they're the real heroes of this
50:20 Internet I was just kind of the guy that
50:23 could kind of keep everybody protected
50:25 and keep it running but at the end of
50:26 the day they were the ones doing the
50:28 hard work so if there's anybody to thank
50:31 in this scenario there's a handful of
50:33 people that my former director I I can't
50:36 say his name for that promise I would
50:37 never he has to make that decision if he
50:40 wants to come out but he's certainly one
50:41 of those heroes how could office
50:44 certainly one of those heroes another
50:46 guy that kid green is one of those
50:47 heroes another guy that I can't mention
50:49 his name is one of those heroes because
50:52 he is still fighting the fight in
50:54 Washington right now today to David this
50:57 moment running parts of this program so
51:01 that's encouraging
51:03 it's alive and well now is it called a
51:07 tip I don't know I'd probably change the
51:09 name frankly but other than that it's
51:12 the same thing it's say it's exactly the
51:15 same thing you can call it a Lincoln or
51:17 a Ford It's Made the same plant the same
51:19 car different badge

00:02 [Music]
00:09 any questions you have let me know a
00:12 couple ground rules there are no ground
00:14 rules
00:14 whatever questions you have I'd be happy
00:17 to answer any question not answer I
00:20 don't have the answer I'll tell you I
00:22 don't have the answer and I don't know
00:23 if it requires an answer that sensitive
00:26 or that would cause me to violate my NDA
00:27 I'll tell you that and I won't be able
00:29 to answer it but at least you'll hear
00:31 from me and it will tell you that it
00:33 can't answer the question and you'll
00:34 know why I want to be as transparent and
00:37 forthcoming as possible also before I
00:40 begin I would like to also extend a few
00:42 thank-yous to a couple folks here first
00:46 of all mr. rich Hoffman thank you for
00:48 inviting us I want to let everybody know
00:50 here that this is important to folks
00:53 like Colin I we we do not get a speaking
00:57 engagement thing to do this we do this
01:00 free because we believe in what we're
01:01 doing because we know you believe in
01:03 what you're doing so I want to make sure
01:05 that's clear I also want to thank mr.
01:07 Robert Powell thank you very much sir
01:09 for coordination and everything all your
01:11 help so far is been fantastic indeed
01:13 awesome also mr. Morgan Bell so thank
01:17 you very much mr. Joan Donato and by the
01:21 way please give angel my regard she was
01:23 a fantastic agent electricians of a
01:25 she's a fantastic officer and then I
01:29 would also like to thank mr. Humberto
01:31 Rojas and is a very lovely life over
01:33 here
01:35 these folks are kind of the Mavericks in
01:39 their field and despite until recently a
01:43 lot of the stigma that you all know
01:46 surrounding this portfolio they continue
01:49 to do their jobs day in and day out and
01:51 that says a lot I would also like to
01:53 very quick just a quick show of hands if
01:55 you're comfortable those who have ever
01:57 served either in the middle
01:58 or work with the US government or
02:00 working with the US government in any
02:02 capacity at all anybody at all quite a
02:06 few people I want to thank you sincerely
02:08 for your service
02:09 it is truly humbling thank you so very
02:12 much and then of course last but not
02:15 least an individual who I did not know I
02:17 only heard about her today
02:19 I do apologize for my ignorance but it
02:21 is the passing of Miss Karen King that
02:24 is that is very certainly very
02:26 unfortunate and sad news to hear and
02:29 especially for somebody who had
02:31 contributed much to this field so and we
02:36 led to I would like to also offer my
02:39 condolences sincerely to her family
02:42 unfortunately so before changing slides
02:48 here and would also like to thank you
02:51 all last but not least certainly
02:53 manami's you're really the reason why
02:57 we're here
02:57 folks I Cal myself others because you
03:01 all have been pursuing something that I
03:05 only did for the last decade some of you
03:08 have invested 30 40 even 15 years of
03:12 your life and that is one hell of a
03:15 commitment that is a marriage so I want
03:20 to I want to tell you sincerely from
03:21 from from myself and from how and others
03:24 thank you very much for for your
03:27 commitment and I'm very hopeful that
03:30 forums like this are going to continue
03:33 to bring this conversation to light so
03:37 with no further ado let me go ahead and
03:39 see if I fit in this side I have to
03:41 preface this Hooked on Phonics did not
03:43 work for me too well
03:45 maybe perspective so let's see if it
03:48 works okay a lot of people ask me so who
03:56 do you think disclosure has occurred and
03:59 I think it has occurred and I think it
04:02 is still occurring as I said before I
04:04 believe this in the process it's not an
04:06 event
04:07 I'm also asked well does this
04:09 confirmation well what does that mean
04:14 because if you look at the word
04:16 confirmation that kind of gives the
04:18 impression that there's some sort of
04:19 underlying narrative to begin with that
04:21 you're confirming and I'm not sure we
04:25 have that narrative yet I think we need
04:28 more data I think we're in the process
04:30 of building that narrative and we do
04:32 that through using the scientific method
04:33 and collecting evidence and materials
04:35 and doing the proper analysis on this in
04:39 a way that is is can be cured renewed
04:41 and of course the table right that's
04:43 what science is all about
04:44 so is this confirmation in my opinion
04:47 I'm gonna cap it out the mind it's only
04:49 my opinion I don't like to give it very
04:50 often I don't think this is confirmation
04:53 because I don't think we have a
04:54 narrative yet and I'm very wary of going
04:57 down any Avenue where we have some
04:59 preconceived notion of what something
05:01 might or might not be already and so we
05:03 have enough evidence to establish the
05:05 facts so December 16th you all know
05:10 better than I knew what happened the
05:13 news got out and and everybody everybody
05:16 was talking about it I would like to
05:19 share with you some personal insight we
05:21 seized a call from a very dear colleague
05:23 of mine who's the Pentagon who works
05:26 this effort very very closely
05:28 and so yes reading between the lines
05:30 when I say is working this I don't mean
05:32 in the past I actively working this so
05:34 that means separately teams so
05:37 congratulations it's still going and
05:39 that too will come out hopefully in a
05:42 very official way sometime soon but I
05:45 received a call from him very very
05:47 recently
05:47 it was this week and he said you know
05:49 blue is funny because a conversation
05:51 that I had to have with you just a year
05:53 and a half ago it was bold within a skin
05:57 in a TSS CIA facility that stopped
06:00 cleared and we had to whisper to have
06:02 this conversation I can now have this
06:04 conversation in the open halls of
06:05 Pentagon imagine that how far we've come
06:08 and so as we sit here today I encourage
06:12 you look around look at all these
06:13 pictures around you you're right now at
06:16 the epicenter of where mankind as
06:19 species left this planet and when
06:24 somewhere else
06:25 went to the moon I was looking at some
06:26 of these pictures they're profound and
06:28 one picture you have a dirt road with a
06:30 few model teens and people walking along
06:32 a dusty road just 40 years later 40 06:35 years later you have someone also
06:37 walking on a dusty road but it's not on
06:40 this planet it's on the moon and using
06:42 the spacesuit so things happen and and
06:48 because of people like you and the
06:50 scientific community science fiction
06:52 becomes science fact
06:54 and so anybody who would look at you
06:57 with some sort of maybe tilt a smile or
07:00 something like that and say are you
07:01 talking about UFOs what does that mean
07:04 well we don't know what it means but you
07:06 should probably pay attention because it
07:08 is real now what it is and how let's
07:12 intentions all these other things will
07:13 left for some other people who need to
07:14 figure out that's beyond me but we have
07:18 established the fact that they're real
07:19 and we have also established the fact
07:21 that from a national security
07:23 perspective but we'll talk about this
07:24 enough some people are a little bit
07:26 leery of the fact that right I always
07:28 historically tied this to it to a
07:31 national security threat we'll get to
07:33 that but you now have people out the
07:38 highest levels of the United States
07:39 government and international communities
07:42 of their governments finally taking this
07:45 is upon real resources real talents real
07:49 expertise to look at this and finally
07:52 figure out what this means
07:55 so congratulations I think this is an
07:59 historic event for everybody to have a
08:02 forum like this where everybody can sit
08:05 down and have an honest conversation
08:07 about a topic that has been so fraught
08:12 the floor with with skepticism and taboo
08:16 you've achieved a lot keep in mind just
08:18 ten years ago scientists still couldn't
08:21 agree whether or not the giant squid
08:22 that Pacific really even existed because
08:24 though it's all on camera
08:26 and so finally enough washed up on a
08:29 beach and enough showed up on deep sea
08:32 cameras where now we realize oh you know
08:34 what there really are sea monsters in
08:36 the ocean but they're actually a species
08:39 it's actually part of nature it's not
08:42 pseudoscience it's just me and so my
08:47 time at the Pentagon working with some
08:49 fantastic human beings like how it could
08:51 often others we approach this very much
08:55 the same way we approach this from a
08:57 scientific perspective we wanted to know
09:00 what we can capture empirical with the
09:02 parable data qualify and quantify it so
09:06 then we can go ahead and take that data
09:08 and try to figure out what it is we're
09:10 dealing with and so that's really in a
09:13 nutshell this this occurred and my
09:16 intention for for leaving the Department
09:18 of Defense I would also have been
09:19 verifying it was not a matter of
09:21 disloyalty it was in fact loyalty why I
09:24 left the Department of Defense in the
09:25 first place I am very very loyal to the
09:28 Department of Defense if you look at my
09:30 resume
09:30 hmm oh one of the very last things I
09:32 told secretary maths you can always
09:35 count on me to carry the water for DoD I
09:37 love my country I love the Department of
09:40 Defense I believe in what we're trying
09:42 to accomplish but in order for me to
09:46 accomplish and finish the very mission I
09:49 was given by the way which I did not ask
09:51 for I actually had to me my beloved
09:55 Department to finish that mission so if
09:59 anybody has any speculation out there
10:00 why I left I did not leave in bad blood
10:05 I left because I had to because it was
10:08 the only way I was going to be able to
10:10 get the boss who I was little to who I
10:12 served in combat with to be able to pay
10:15 attention because certain people that
10:16 were minding him were not providing him
10:20 the information and in my opinion the
10:22 only thing more dangerous to a country
10:25 keeping mine that Department of Defense
10:27 mission is to protect its national
10:28 borders the only thing more dangerous
10:31 than our ability not to protect our
10:33 national borders and our people is not
10:35 to be able to have a conversation that
10:37 that threat exists and that was my that
10:40 is what I objected to me we couldn't
10:42 even have a conversation about it
10:45 because of social stigma and that is
10:47 wrong so that is why I chose to leap and
10:51 of course a lot of speculation came out
10:55 as a result of that am i spy for the CIA
10:59 trying to fool people in their soft
11:01 disclosure as I said before look at the
11:04 end of the day I'll tell you no but
11:05 hasn't really matter because people
11:06 gonna believe what they believe in the
11:08 NATO cares because we're getting what we
11:10 wanted you're getting the information
11:12 that was so squirrel away in these
11:14 little secret hidden compartments it's
11:16 now coming to life you're now realizing
11:19 we were looking at the aircraft 40 years
11:20 in the future because if you look at 40 11:22 years ago in the past what do we have we
11:24 have six teams we had f-14 Tomcats we
11:27 had
11:27 fleurs what do we have today we have f8 11:30 teams we have to have 16 we have f-22 we
11:33 have that for seven teams but there's
11:35 still Jets when you look at the DIA
11:37 studies I think it's very evident what
11:40 we're looking at we're looking at their
11:42 craft 40 years in the future we're going
11:43 to get it so lit up right now so this
11:48 was a temp contract folks I also want to
11:51 go a little bit into what it means and
11:54 you have you seen a pair of aerospace
11:56 what I'm talking about aviation we're
11:58 not talking about airplanes we're
12:01 talking about things that have the
12:02 ability to operate both in an atmosphere
12:04 environment and no atmosphere
12:07 environment and you know what
12:09 probably underwater - why is that
12:12 important because these things are being
12:13 able to perform in a way that we still
12:17 don't quite get understand it we
12:19 certainly cannot replicate more
12:21 importantly they can do it in all
12:24 virtual mediums so let me digress for
12:27 just one moment here and do a very brief
12:30 and I don't want me to solve anybody's
12:32 intelligence I know pretty much
12:33 everybody just reading this more about
12:34 physics but as it was explained to me if
12:38 let's say this between here is a
12:41 aircraft an aircraft will take an
12:45 aircraft because it has to perform in
12:47 our atmosphere so it has a nose it's got
12:50 a tail it's got wings it's not control
12:52 surfaces it's not an engine in the back
12:54 so playing pretty much less a complain
12:56 yeah might be a b2 versus an f-16 but it
13:00 still is a plane
13:01 where's a rocket doesn't have to fly
13:05 really for very much time in our
13:06 atmosphere it's in no atmosphere so it
13:10 has thrusters doesn't have wings so that
13:11 control services as thrusters has
13:13 chemical rocket motors instead of the
13:16 jet engine because there's no atmosphere
13:17 and yet a submarine looks completely
13:20 different it actually uses buoyancy and
13:22 a propeller to move underwater that's
13:24 why the submarine
13:25 bring a plane was in the plane and a
13:27 rocket looks like a rocket for the most
13:29 part yeah these things we're seeing can
13:32 operate in all these environments
13:34 without changing their physical
13:35 attributes and still continue to perform
13:38 the same way now for those of you who
13:40 are scientists you know the drag
13:42 coefficients we're talking about when
13:44 you're in water when you look at a
13:46 torpedo and I can't go to the details
13:47 here but anything above a moderate speed
13:51 underwater the drag becomes so
13:55 significant that it's almost impossible
13:58 to overcome unless you use other
14:01 technologies to reduce that friction and
14:05 yet these things can perform just as
14:09 easy we picked it up on radar we think
14:11 about much sooner and we pick them up
14:13 with everything in between this was a
14:16 contract focus I've talked about this
14:19 before but this came out back more than
14:23 a year ago before the list of dia
14:26 studies was ever released and this is
14:28 actual from the contract why is that
14:30 important because of work phenomena is
14:32 used does it say aircraft folks
14:34 it says phenomenon it's in black and
14:37 white you can read it yourself in the
14:39 contract black and white every word that
14:42 we use is deliberate in the US
14:44 government you know that from a contract
14:46 vehicle perspective you've never been a
14:48 core contract officers representative
14:50 you know what I'm talking about
14:51 words have meaning they have legal
14:54 meaning so when you see that
14:55 investigating legitimacy of currently
14:58 observed phenomena investigate that
15:00 doesn't mean just do studies folks that
15:02 doesn't mean sit back with a stubby
15:03 pencil and just collect data its
15:05 investigate it's doing it's an action so
15:09 and then ask the question are they
15:11 achievable my current understanding of
15:13 physics and engineering well if there
15:15 are craft than the answer is yes unless
15:19 or not
15:21 and then it says at the bottom if not
15:23 what research is required to achieve it
15:24 well those are the studies that mr. Pugh
15:27 top helped get done for us and several
15:30 other very very very renowned scientists
15:33 some of the best in the world in their
15:36 fields minded so that's why you have
15:40 those studies that came out and again it
15:42 says in black and white phenomena does
15:46 not say aircraft so anybody who tries to
15:49 twist that narrative I would encourage
15:51 you to do a little reading or encourage
15:53 them to do a little reading because it's
15:56 in black and white so this is a slide I
16:03 put out before but I can probably talk a
16:06 little bit more not now about it because
16:07 all these studies came out so let me
16:11 briefly go over what the five
16:13 observables work now you're talking
16:16 about an object here's our little
16:18 airplane again the first observables is
16:22 sudden and instantaneous acceleration
16:24 what we're talking about are the
16:27 inertial forces that are that are
16:29 exhibited by something when it changes
16:32 direction from point A to point B and
16:33 possibly back to a again or Z or
16:35 whatever there are internal inertial
16:37 forces that we can look at and we can
16:40 actually measure to determine is this
16:43 something that we know so put this in
16:45 context the human body can withstand for
16:48 a very short period of time about nine
16:50 GS
16:50 wearing a GC otherwise very unpleasant
16:53 things start to happen blackouts
16:55 brownouts et cetera and that's sixteen
16:58 and I'll be a little bit older aircraft
16:59 anybody here from General Dynamics no
17:02 anyways great aircraft little older
17:04 still one of those highly maneuverable
17:06 aircraft we've ever built except a few
17:09 experimental ones but they were unmanned
17:11 so and that aircraft can go anywhere
17:13 between
17:14 into 18 G's before the material science
17:18 aspect of the aircraft being it's
17:20 breakdown
17:21 meaning when we snap off okay there are
17:25 other things missiles that can
17:29 experience much greater gene for so
17:31 again a period of time and yet very
17:34 short what we're seeing is a consistent
17:37 and a persistent ability to perform gene
17:39 forces well in excess of 400 genes and
17:42 that's on the conservative side well
17:46 beyond the healthy limitations of
17:47 anything biologically certain to a span
17:49 and by the way this is not world
17:51 agreeing to them this is this is
17:52 actually documented it's been recorded
17:54 it's real you can seeing yourself and
17:56 the Nimitz is just one of many many
17:59 examples that I'm fairly certain are
18:01 going to come to light really soon
18:04 the next one is hypersonic velocity so
18:07 here's our little airplane again flying
18:08 in the atmosphere and everybody knows
18:12 it's supersonic speeds are when you're
18:13 talking hypersonic velocity you're
18:15 talking about Mach 5 Plus that's really
18:17 fast but now do we have aircraft that
18:19 can do it sure Hank the Space Shuttle
18:22 did and it was blowing at Jeannie
18:23 orbital velocity but not the way we're
18:27 seeing and certainly not without the
18:29 Associated signatures when you see the
18:31 shuttle launch baby you know it's the
18:33 shuttle
18:33 I mean it's loud you see a smoke plume
18:36 from miles and miles and miles of earth
18:38 shapes when an aircraft is doing that
18:41 kind of speed or missile you have heat
18:44 ablation and friction you have
18:46 atmospheric ionization you have
18:48 contrails of the Faculty of acoustic
18:50 signatures such as sonic booms that are
18:54 very hard to get around an engineer
18:56 around it okay that's why you have
18:59 something like the b2 it's really
19:01 stealthy but it's not
19:02 really fast you want to be really fast
19:05 you're probably not going to be really
19:06 stealthy so it's a trade-off yeah these
19:10 things are performing hypersonic
19:11 velocity some cases happy careful icing
19:16 what I will tell you is that they have
19:19 been officially clocked at over 13,000 19:22 miles an hour unofficially much much
19:25 faster and by the way these are through
19:29 military capabilities okay not grandma's
19:33 awesome weights in the backyard
19:36 the third observable is a little bit of
19:38 an oxymoron low observability right the
19:44 fact that you cannot see it sometimes is
19:47 something that you can record sometimes
19:49 the absence of data itself is just as
19:53 important as having data if you've seen
19:55 ahold of the picture done ooh
19:58 something's creating that hole and very
20:00 much the same way here you'll have the
20:03 reports of the pilots eyewitnesses by
20:05 the way highly trained observers all
20:07 with top-secret security clearances by
20:10 the way trusted to fly lively missions
20:13 over US cities going fight and we need
20:15 more money that these these people are
20:17 trained to know the silhouette between
20:19 the mig-25 and mig-29 and f16 and a
20:21 European Toronado they know it they know
20:24 the difference between a drone and a
20:26 quadcopter a kite and they're telling
20:28 you what they're seeing is unlike
20:30 anything they've ever seen before but
20:31 all the wait there's more because what
20:33 they're reporting and saying you know
20:34 it's weird kind of silvery object it's
20:36 hard to see is also being backed up by
20:39 the electro optical data the cameras are
20:41 seeing that same buzzing weird object
20:42 too with his weird glowing aura this
20:45 halo around it and oh by the way it
20:47 happens to be the
20:48 same thing that the radar is picking up
20:50 to simultaneously and not just one ray
20:53 are many radars at the same time from
20:55 different positions okay so they have
20:58 spatial and temporal Tina coming in oh I
21:01 think they're probably okay spatial and
21:07 temporal information all now coming
21:09 together telling you that you've got
21:13 something there may not know what it is
21:14 hard to see it but maybe that the fact
21:17 that it's hard to see in itself is an
21:19 observable thing is telling you
21:20 something there's some physics there
21:22 right you look at the desert a hot
21:25 desert on a hot thing you see that
21:27 Mirage effect it's kind of harder to
21:28 sees through are we looking at something
21:31 similar and of course it you can see on
21:34 the right these are some of the reasons
21:35 why it's important for us to them from a
21:37 DoD perspective a military perspective a
21:40 national security perspective because if
21:43 I can do instantaneous acceleration the
21:45 hypersonic velocity in low permeability
21:46 that gives me the ability to understand
21:48 thrust management capabilities g-force
21:51 neutralization rapid deployment of a
21:55 capability
21:56 first-strike capability right so if I
21:58 can go ahead and hit my enemy before
22:00 they hit me then that's probably better
22:04 and then of course stealth low
22:06 observability the other two observables
22:09 multi medium travel and positive look
22:11 we'll talk very briefly about that - I
22:12 apologize on the right if it's hard to
22:15 see those I didn't get a chance when I
22:17 was going between PC and Mac and back
22:20 and forth on this in tropical but those
22:23 are supposed to be a multi medium travel
22:26 we talked briefly about that an object
22:27 that can perform just as easily in an
22:29 atmosphere low Earth orbit possibly
22:31 beyond and even underwater now why would
22:35 that be important for us
22:36 well strategic surprise military
22:39 flexibility battlespace dominance I can
22:43 fly I can swim it I can do everything in
22:45 between that's huge but that again is
22:48 just to a world of compromising we're
22:50 talking
22:50 from an engineering perspective for
22:53 example you look at a seaplane right
22:55 that's a plane that can fly but it can
22:57 also kind of be like a boat but a
22:59 seaplane isn't real it's you know is it
23:00 it's it's an amount of evasion of
23:02 compromises it's not really a great
23:04 airplane and it's not really a great
23:07 book it's just kind of in the middle
23:08 there because it's got a satisfying boat
23:10 so there's these compromises we don't
23:12 see those compromises when we're looking
23:14 at the Ewing theme why is that and then
23:18 of course positively the ability to defy
23:21 the natural effects of Earth's
23:23 gravitational force by the way
23:26 universally applies to us all and we
23:30 have technology sure I mean we have hot
23:33 air balloons
23:34 that's positive lift we have lift wings
23:37 right like an aircraft you have the fork
23:40 before coefficient you have to pay
23:42 attention to thrust lift drag weight you
23:48 have a jet engine that could provide
23:49 that for us you have a propeller engine
23:51 that's handle mechanical way of pushing
23:53 the air and then you have rocket engines
23:55 chemical engines but really those are
23:57 only the four real ways we know how to
23:59 how to defy for any real progress
24:03 natural gravitational force other than
24:05 ballistic right wing aboard or just an
24:08 assignment yeah these things can fly in
24:12 these credible speeds and yet hover like
24:14 a helicopter sometimes for a minute
24:17 sometimes for hours sometimes for days
24:19 they can drop in from 80,000 feet down
24:22 to 50 feet right over the water within
24:24 less than a couple seconds
24:32 you tell me I was part of a lot of
24:37 government programs I have a good
24:40 healthy background in aerospace and
24:42 protecting technologies advanced
24:44 technologies when I was a young special
24:45 agent so you can see from a national
24:52 security perspective there are national
24:55 security implications to this now if you
24:57 ask me a human being is a national
25:00 security threat I think my answer to you
25:02 and me could be able wanted to be it has
25:05 a potential speaker I'm not saying
25:08 they're a threat what I'm saying is that
25:10 they could mean if they wanted to be or
25:13 it couldn't be if it's wanted to be so
25:17 as a result you pay your Department of
25:20 Defense to protect this country from all
25:23 over these for non-domestic that's what
25:24 it says so you you want a Department of
25:28 Defense to consider this as potential
25:30 national security threat until it can
25:32 prove it's not so that's why in my job
25:35 look at this is a humanitarian thing and
25:37 everybody was here for peace and sing
25:38 Kumbaya
25:39 give it to the State Department give it
25:40 to an NGO give it to USAID that's not
25:44 doing the t's job whose job is to go
25:45 fight and win it once quickly that is
25:48 what you paid us to do and so that is
25:52 why there was a national security Nexus
25:55 because if it was anything other than
25:56 national security the DoD would not be
25:58 involved the Air Force wouldn't be
26:00 involved maybe wouldn't be involved most
26:03 likely CIA England's me involved
26:05 dia and everybody else it is a national
26:08 security issue is a threat I don't know
26:12 but it is an issue in my opinion
26:21 but you know what this effort didn't
26:24 start with anything
26:25 and I know that and you know that a tip
26:30 was just one piece of a long legacy of
26:33 efforts that some people in this room
26:35 were actually part of how incredible is
26:38 that right so here we are today and
26:41 we're going all the way back some some
26:43 folks in this room we're actually a part
26:45 of Project Blue look these are documents
26:51 that were actually released by these
26:54 organizations I'm talking about the same
26:57 flying observers in fact going back to
27:00 the 1950s early fifties 1950 to be
27:03 precisely officers describing a flying
27:07 white butane tank about 40 feet applying
27:12 logic what does that sound to you
27:16 and these observables go all the way
27:20 back to 1947 and they're written in some
27:23 cases by four-star officers they're
27:27 written to in front Jane and Gruber as
27:30 high as it gets so don't look at agent
27:36 and say well agent frontal this now
27:37 actually we didn't we just continue the
27:40 legacy of a lot of hard work
27:42 it goes well before that we have known
27:45 about these things for a long time the
27:46 only thing they did with the help of
27:48 folks at Cal was be able to understand
27:50 that these things fell into a category
27:52 of observables that then allowed us to
27:54 try to figure out the physics now this
27:56 is an accomplishment of agent
27:58 unfortunately I can't take credit for
27:59 the credit goes to that guy but that is
28:02 something that this this office was able
28:04 to achieve but I do think that's
28:05 significant because once you understand
28:07 the physics you understand how it works
28:10 you understand how it works and then you
28:12 can replicate it so I encourage you at
28:16 some time to take a look at some of
28:17 these documents very very interesting
28:20 again a lot of these are on
28:23 recent poia there's a lot of them I
28:24 don't expect everybody to digest all of
28:26 it but there's enough there or anybody
28:29 to look at these we're going to take
28:30 these slides and go up to see some of
28:32 these examples they're pretty incredible
28:34 I'm sure we'll do this anyway so
28:36 everybody think they'd bring me they go
28:38 through a fine-tooth comb so I try to
28:40 put a couple Easter eggs in there so
28:48 there's a long history but you know what
28:51 it's not one of the us folks foreign
28:54 governments they've gotten interest to
28:56 and some of these countries have
28:59 actually admitted it
29:00 for some reason they're a little more
29:03 forthcoming than we are I don't know why
29:05 I'm totally mad your wife but these are
29:09 some of the organizations that are
29:10 actually within their governments that
29:13 are actually charter specifically to
29:18 look at you a piece from a scientific
29:21 perspective mind you so you're talking
29:24 about money resources and budgets and
29:26 personnel it could be diverted to
29:28 anything like we're on terrorism but
29:29 they're not they're converted to the UAP
29:31 phenomena because they think it's
29:33 important enough that they understand
29:35 what they're dealing with and frankly I
29:36 don't blame them but guess what it's not
29:40 just that there's some more countries so
29:44 I think that we had this conversation
29:46 we're beginning to realize that this is
29:50 not a u.s. phenomenon this is not even a
29:53 phenomena for this hemisphere it is
29:56 truly a global phenomena there's a
29:59 gentleman I've been to here from Peru
30:00 and you know what they have one hell of
30:05 an effort a lot of interesting things
30:08 know happens in in South America how and
30:11 I have had a debriefing with one
30:15 individual in particular from the
30:17 country down
30:18 very senior person I still remember that
30:20 debriefing very very compelling and it
30:24 was an official US government deem
30:25 region by the way so yeah there's a
30:30 history here and this is like this is a
30:32 global phenomena so I what my quickly
30:35 look at it I mean our friends are
30:37 looking at it some are for have a series
30:39 are looking at it sure you should look
30:42 at know there's two things I'd like to
30:44 before you know the next slide talk
30:46 about just briefly national security
30:50 threat I heard someone else say this is
30:51 far more eloquently but let me see if I
30:53 can we capture it real quick
30:56 hypothetically sir senator so-and-so Lou
31:02 do you think this is really gonna be
31:03 really into that just really really well
31:08 sir mr. senator we have we have two
31:11 options and we have something coming
31:13 into our airspace that we have no idea
31:16 what it is how it works and there's not
31:18 a damn thing we can do about it I don't
31:20 by the way has a capability to bring
31:21 potentially nuclear capabilities over
31:24 the White House in two minutes or it's a
31:28 mass delusion everybody is absolutely
31:30 crazy
31:32 thousands of DoD people who have
31:34 top-secret clearances trained observers
31:36 and you trust to go fight win the words
31:38 look like me this you don't know it's
31:39 hideous
31:40 they're crazy by the way some of these
31:42 people are their finger on the nuclear
31:43 button is that not also they should so
31:47 in a way it's an actual street issue
31:48 doesn't matter what side you're on
31:50 doesn't matter how you feel about it hey
31:52 this message three issues those are the
31:53 only two hours it's real or it's not
31:55 neither one is an actual security issue
31:58 so I think I think it's importantly we
32:02 look at it that way and so then the next
32:03 option well you know sir the DMV
32:08 scratches are and there's someone you
32:09 know actually what do you think it's
32:11 Russian
32:12 well good one you know what
32:15 great so how long have you known DoD and
32:21 this was a Russian came to Berlin
32:23 and you failed to inform Congress which
32:25 by the way is law
32:28 what's your answer now because okay
32:31 great it's Russian why would you talk
32:33 you spent how many years and they had
32:34 this game really the entire time so you
32:38 see my pointer when you go down the
32:39 lobby train it's really not that
32:41 illogical to have this conversation from
32:45 a national street perspective because
32:47 either way you look at it is a national
32:49 security issue but with some challenges
32:53 also to come opportunities we are in a
32:57 room now where we have some of the
33:00 greatest minds in this country working
33:02 together to put human beings on the moon
33:07 coming in today this morning I was
33:11 stunned to see a life-sized version of
33:13 the Saturn 5 rocket amazing amazing one
33:20 of the most powerful fastest machines
33:24 mankind has ever built ever is standing
33:29 right over there right in your backyard
33:32 right and let's look at what happened
33:36 during the last space race a lot of
33:38 things happen a lot of industries came
33:42 out of the last space race that we
33:45 couldn't even imagine so my humble
33:47 company along with Hal and several other
33:49 people that Chris known Steve justice we
33:52 have a company that a lot of people kind
33:54 of say well alright hold on you manage
33:57 it and now you're doing this thing with
33:58 TSA and okay you're trying to build
34:02 something you're trying to study
34:03 something you're also selling books
34:05 I'm confused okay well it's okay you can
34:08 be but it actually makes sense but
34:11 that's a whole nother breed but I'm here
34:13 to tell you these are kind of the three
34:14 divisions we have field operations
34:16 science and aerospace and education
34:18 entertainment now what the hell does
34:20 entertainment and a rock star have to do
34:22 with this you've got a popcorn folks
34:25 same reason you're here today you're all
34:27 coming here to have the discussion and
34:28 have a conversation in order to do that
34:30 you got to get the word out how do the
34:33 rock star in a musician who understands
34:36 how to push a message and there's a
34:40 little bit of a vanguard and maverick
34:42 and that's really care about breaking
34:43 some of the rules that you guys like me
34:45 don't worry about sometimes you got to
34:47 break a little China and he knows how to
34:49 break a lot of China you know it's also
34:52 an individual who got to the highest
34:53 levels of government whether what
34:55 admitted or not he got to Podesta so we
35:01 have to give credit where credit is due
35:02 and part of this is like when spielberg
35:05 came out with his Close Encounters of
35:06 the Third Kind that was I think we can
35:10 look back and say wow that was actually
35:12 a very monumental living it was not for
35:14 entertainment but it was a monument to
35:16 living and so you there are examples
35:19 where science fiction has actually
35:22 informed science fact in science fact
35:25 has informed science fiction and that's
35:27 done in entertainment let's put an
35:29 example Jean Bradbury Star Trek right
35:31 remember when they have a little trike
35:33 water and a little flip phone and all of
35:34 a sudden Motorola 30 years later woke up
35:36 with a punch they talked about the trial
35:39 or kind of this thing done where you
35:41 look inside your body now we've got
35:42 cat-scans so those are some examples
35:45 where science fiction help inform
35:47 science fact but let's look at some
35:48 examples where science faculty from
35:50 science vision in the entertainment
35:51 industry and that won't be very much
35:55 follow Thirteen's
35:56 a mission that almost became an
36:00 national tragedy and disaster but it
36:05 wasn't it was a mirror and 30 years
36:09 later
36:10 young Hollywood doing a movie with Ron
36:12 Howard has director on Apollo 13 right
36:15 to get that message out so no different
36:18 than anybody else trying to get their
36:20 message out no different than
36:21 elimination here we're trying to get the
36:25 conversation started and what you saw in
36:27 History Channel that is a start
36:30 you're talking about a global audience
36:32 of millions and millions of people who
36:34 finally had the conversation and by the
36:35 way what people say on camera you can't
36:37 take it back once it's said once this
36:39 recording is there for posterity for
36:41 ever so this is a way that we can have
36:47 that conversation and we can get people
36:49 to have the conversation people with
36:52 access people with expertise people in
36:57 the government this is not the show by
37:00 the way if anybody wants to know how
37:03 well you do financially doing a show
37:05 after seven months like this traveling
37:07 the world internationally working their
37:08 butt off I've made enough just okay but
37:11 I've made enough to buy a decent
37:12 lawnmower so I can now do my long and
37:18 then self-propelled llama so if you
37:21 think these are some get-rich-quick
37:22 scheme it's not those
37:25 go play the lot their chances of making
37:27 more money doing that you do this
37:29 because you believe in and once you see
37:32 it you can't forget so this is our
37:36 humble company we talked about some of
37:38 the innovations that came out profound
37:42 the innovations resulted from the last
37:44 space race well let's take a look at
37:46 fuel portable life support systems micro
37:51 scanners remote medical monitoring and
37:53 sensors memory foam prevents here's just
37:55 a small few examples let's look at a few
37:58 more cosmic rays shield now using
38:01 satellites freeze-dried food I'm not
38:04 sure that was such a great innovation
38:06 portable soil vacuum reflective foil if
38:09 we use now for thermal insulation this
38:12 goes on and on
38:13 right human prosthetics thank NASA
38:16 action over over 6,300 innovations any
38:21 of you have athletic shoes and go work
38:25 out of yoga
38:26 Paulo any of you have a cat scan in the
38:29 last year all LED lights anybody who has
38:33 ever seen an LED light or uses LED
38:36 lights try to save one in your house Wow
38:40 each one of these in some cases tried to
38:43 be multi-billion dollar industries and
38:46 they had no idea NASA had no idea what
38:50 was going to come out of the space race
38:51 and here's just a few small examples so
38:54 guess what in my opinion I think we're
38:56 at that paradigm again I think we are at
38:59 this paradigm where now we are faced
39:01 with a new reality and the sky's the
39:06 limit folks if do you think that's
39:07 exciting
39:08 what did you see what comes out of this
39:10 when you can manipulate space time
39:13 metric imagine what type of what type of
39:18 things we can do for mankind in
39:20 community and that's just one so our
39:24 company is is focused to a great deal on
39:27 the science base in the aerospace on
39:29 looking at this as a as a business case
39:35 model that might work
39:41 all right if you're here just slide
39:42 everybody wants to talk about sheep
39:50 cheese look all those products that came
39:55 out on the last space race from acquired
39:57 material science scientists in some
39:59 cases like you that are sitting in this
40:01 room we need your help
40:02 you know how the material you don't have
40:04 the analysis you know how the data you
40:06 get nothing so this is why forums like
40:09 yours are so important
40:12 you've got to have scientists at the end
40:15 of the day to figure out just what the
40:16 hell it is we're looking at what what
40:19 makes this material so special now in
40:21 some cases this material was told it's
40:24 special through analysis guess one yeah
40:28 not so special some of it I will point
40:34 out which one is up on that slide there
40:37 are some that are absolutely special and
40:41 have been briefed to some very very
40:42 senior levels of the stuff and they do
40:45 remarkable and extraordinary things and
40:47 they're built in such a way that to this
40:49 day we still can't replicate to this day
40:55 so that should be that should be very
40:57 telling material science is a critical
41:00 piece to this we can't just sit there
41:02 and say I told you so that's not what
41:05 this is about
41:06 this is not this effort is not about
41:08 satisfying the natural curiosity of
41:11 people who want to know right now as
41:13 I've said before there's a difference in
41:15 giving information right and giving it
41:17 right now I am not in the business of
41:20 giving information right now I'd rather
41:22 give it to you right so you have to do
41:25 due diligence you have to understand
41:28 what it takes to do the analysis and to
41:32 respect the scientific method and to
41:35 respect the people you're working with
41:36 in government whether it be the
41:38 legislative branch or the executive
41:39 branch you have to give people time you
41:42 have been steeped many of you in this
41:44 for decades some of these people are
41:46 learning about this for the very first
41:47 time no kidding
41:48 they're scratching so wait a minute
41:50 that's real that's real can you imagine
41:54 that so you gotta give them time and
41:57 then you have to make decisions if you
42:00 can imagine with something like this
42:01 there's all sorts of agencies
42:02 organizations that have an interest in
42:04 this I can't tell you which ones
42:06 unfortunately you can use your
42:07 imagination and it's not just propulsion
42:10 there's other organizations that can
42:12 look at this you know in saying let's
42:14 say from let's say my perspective right
42:18 I put X amount of pounds of armor on a
42:22 vehicle that slow me down and weigh me
42:25 down what if I didn't have to have armor
42:27 at all what if I have a way to serve
42:31 material where bullets didn't matter it
42:36 didn't do anything so we're taking this
42:41 step by step I know people are hungry
42:43 for information and I knew that I do
42:46 believe is forthcoming but it has to be
42:49 done the right way and by the way let me
42:52 caveat that to these people
42:53 say when it's a right way you're away no
42:55 it's not likely not my way at all but we
43:00 have to respect the people that are
43:02 involved we have to give them the
43:06 flexibility and latitude to take this in
43:09 and start making the right decisions and
43:11 you want always make sure that your
43:13 executive branch in your legislative
43:15 branch are duly informed you don't want
43:17 one being informed and not the other
43:19 politics assignment if a Republican
43:21 Democrat independent you know tea party
43:23 does it okay the bottom line is when you
43:26 serve as a government servant like I
43:29 needed it is our duty responsibility to
43:31 inform leadership and the executive
43:34 branch doesn't matter who's in charge
43:35 and in turn you also have to make sure
43:37 that the legislative branch is also
43:39 informed and you know what one would be
43:42 more informed than the other because
43:43 then they get mad so it takes time it
43:49 takes time but now let's recap very
43:50 quickly the last year for months okay
43:54 just ready put the humor me for one
43:56 moment
43:58 the New York Times came out and publish
44:00 the story that program was real in
44:04 middle Israel they said they spent 22 44:06 million dollars on three millions for
44:09 the first time in US government history
44:11 were released by the US government
44:14 through the actual review process on
44:16 objects and they still say to this day
44:19 we have no idea what they aren't by the
44:20 way they were already analyzed so please
44:23 don't show me some sort of video game
44:25 that some will pull out their PC and say
44:27 look that's IR flavored it's not even a
44:29 real picture looking at video okay give
44:32 me real danger we had the best of the
44:35 best from the intelligence community
44:36 looking at this that briefed me and they
44:39 said Lou we have a clue this is some
44:42 weird stuff and by the way you will see
44:45 that we even had people
44:46 ATS be on camera a lesson on camera same
44:55 thing
44:55 bingo not include 50 years of doing
45:00 investigation for the NTSB I've never
45:02 seen anything like that in my career for
45:05 the record on camera so I think it's
45:12 important as we build a compelling case
45:14 that we can tell keeping in mind that
45:16 even the grief I'm giving you today
45:17 there are going to be people maybe even
45:19 in this audience but there going to be
45:20 people
45:21 if this goes out that I'm gonna
45:23 scrutinize every single word I say and
45:24 they are waiting for me to mess up one
45:27 wrong word that violates my NDA and I go
45:29 to jail he won't see you for a very long
45:32 time so I have to be careful I will not
45:37 violate my NBA not because I'm afraid of
45:39 jail just because but I am gonna try to
45:47 have a conversation in a way that gets
45:50 everybody involved and that information
45:52 comes to you the right way because it
45:54 shouldn't be coming from the way
45:55 sentence on them shouldn't be coming
45:56 world according to Lou and this is this
45:59 is everything but they should be coming
46:01 doing the government channels the right
46:03 channels because ultimately that's why I
46:06 really left the Department of Defense I
46:07 wanted to fix it I didn't want to ruin
46:09 it
46:10 these are good people most of those
46:12 people are my friends and foxhole into
46:14 combat with they're good they're loyal
46:16 they're Patriots yeah there's this
46:18 function in the government I got it we
46:19 all know it there it's there but there's
46:21 also a lot of goodness and so I wanted
46:24 to compel those in leadership positions
46:26 to fix the system it's not any one
46:31 individuals fault now are the little
46:32 cabal's in there that made my life very
46:34 difficult
46:36 yeah absolutely the work and that's
46:39 another conversation but they were not
46:43 being not representing government read
46:46 law
46:47 and I think it's important that I make
46:49 that distinction and I want the
46:51 government to work to our benefit now
46:53 I'm a private citizen before I was a
46:56 serving other people now the government
46:58 serves for me and I want to make sure it
46:59 works I want to make sure thanks and so
47:02 that's what we're doing so that's really
47:04 what my what my effort has been the last
47:07 year and a half and so if we've been a
47:09 little bit radio silence I apologize for
47:10 that it's not intentional but there's a
47:12 lot of things going on behind the scenes
47:13 just because you don't see what's on top
47:16 of the water there's a whole lot of one
47:18 on underneath so I ask for a little bit
47:20 of patience and understanding what
47:22 you've all been very patient and
47:24 understanding I think that things are
47:27 coming I think good things are coming
47:30 this way yeah they're gonna be a little
47:31 scary for some people maybe this is a
47:34 conversation that that is not only
47:35 involving scientists like human and the
47:37 curious but also making religious
47:40 scholars and philosophers and government
47:42 people and academics right why not bring
47:44 them into the mix because at the end of
47:46 the day I'm sure if you're a doctor
47:49 you're a lawyer you're a cop you're a
47:50 fireman you're a schoolteacher you're a
47:53 student
47:54 this phenomenon affects every single one
47:57 of us equally and how we interpret this
48:02 information may differ depending where
48:04 you come from and what your few want is
48:06 love where do you want is in life but at
48:10 the end of the day we're all affected
48:11 equally so we should probably all have
48:13 the conversation together in my opinion
48:16 anyways so with that said let me go here
48:22 and before we go to questions real quick
48:23 I would like to just point out one last
48:26 thing I was governor crack I did some
48:31 stuff before in the intelligence
48:33 community I spent some time in some
48:37 really bad situations overseas but when
48:40 I came to this program I didn't ask it
48:42 was
48:42 me because of my background in
48:44 counterintelligence to take the job and
48:46 so he did it this is not something that
48:48 I went to scab on I want to do it when
48:51 they came to me and they finally had the
48:52 serious conversation they asked me said
48:54 Lou I want to know what do you think
48:55 about UFOs I told him I don't don't
48:57 think about it
48:58 no no I'm just worried about the N the
49:03 enemy is and so that's probably why I
49:06 was brought on and then later the my the
49:10 the director who preceded me
49:13 unfortunately was right out of the US
49:15 government because of this very caustic
49:20 portfolio a lot of stigma and so people
49:24 like Hal and others who we had to rely
49:28 upon after that director and I took it
49:31 over there really they're the real
49:35 heroes of this I was just kind of the
49:39 guy that can kind of keep everybody
49:40 protected and keep it running but at the
49:42 end of the day they were the ones doing
49:44 the hard work so if there's anybody to
49:47 thank in this scenario there's a handful
49:49 of people that my former director I
49:51 can't say his name because I promised I
49:53 would never he has to make that decision
49:55 if he wants to come out but he's
49:57 certainly one of those heroes how could
50:00 office certainly one of those heroes
50:01 another guy to get green is one of those
50:03 heroes another guy that I can't mention
50:05 his name is one of those heroes
50:07 because he is still fighting to fight in
50:10 Washington right now today today like
50:12 smoke running parts of this program so
50:17 that's encouraging
50:19 it's alive and well
50:21 now
50:23 it's collagen
50:26 but other than that
50:29 it's exactly the same in : Lincoln or
50:33 Florida
50:35 [Music]
50:49 [Music] 

==========5s0mnaz5uwI==========

00:00 you're dead milk man on 91x hello good
00:02 afternoon it's Hillary Tom do you want
00:04 headphones I do you even think about
00:05 that I can't hear anything these days
00:07 okay I hear you though okay that's what
00:10 matters right now for these purposes
00:12 I've enjoyed by Tom DeLonge here in the
00:14 91x studio welcome hello hello I want to
00:18 thank you for being so conveniently
00:20 placed near my house I'm not that far
00:22 away right okay so you're still living
00:24 in San Diego mm-hmm I'm up in Encinitas
00:27 oh you are yeah it's a quality beach
00:29 town for families a boarders absolutely
00:32 yes okay where do you like to eat in
00:34 Encinitas world right there they just
00:36 opened up a fish 101 in Cardiff yeah
00:39 yeah and so I highly recommend it it's
00:42 really good it's really good I ate there
00:44 on Mother's Day with my awesome well
00:49 welcome to 91x again you're probably one
00:52 of the few rock stars that has been here
00:55 like more than 10 times and I just love
00:57 doing he's a rock star remember mother
00:59 was alive but you know you we were
01:04 talking about this earlier your San
01:05 Diego royalty when it comes to music and
01:08 all kinds of things but you've over the
01:10 years you've been here between like
01:11 blink being on loudspeaker back in the
01:13 day and blink 182 and Angels and
01:16 Airwaves I was just telling you I found
01:18 a picture I think from the first Angels
01:20 and Airwaves record when you guys came
01:22 in and was you and David Kennedy and and
01:25 two other guys not not even at and it
01:29 would have been Ryan and Adam right
01:32 right right
01:33 okay so I have an old picture would I
01:35 still love him that we he um came very
01:38 close to actually doing this tour that
01:41 we're coming up you know yeah it was
01:42 really close to having him being on
01:44 we're kind of like a revolving door of
01:46 artists mm-hmm angels was supposed to be
01:48 an art project so it's kind of like
01:49 who's available right now to do it you
01:51 know and not but um oh I love yeah we
01:53 had a lot of fun Adams funny too he is
01:55 funny he's you know he's a quality
01:58 person he has a good guy
02:00 well let's I want to take it way back
02:02 since I have this opportunity to have
02:04 you in here and and you know 91x played
02:07 the adventurer when it came out in 2006 02:10 that was your first record with Angels
02:12 and Airwaves
02:13 only the biggest song of my career to be
02:16 honest really like people think of like
02:18 songs associated with blink-182 and me
02:21 they would say like all the small things
02:22 was like the big I mean it's funny I
02:24 sound like I'm 8 years old in that song
02:26 when I hear I'm oh my god I literally
02:27 was in diapers thinking that you can
02:29 hear it on and when you play that front
02:31 of a hundred thousand people are reading
02:32 or something like that you know I
02:33 remember when we had with us yesterday's
02:35 to somebody when you headlined when
02:37 blink headlined reading the first time I
02:39 stood in there because we did it more
02:40 than once really first of all reading
02:43 and Lee that's right huge festival in
02:45 the UK when you hit all the small things
02:47 you know 100,000 people guys oh my god
02:48 that song has gone a long way the
02:50 adventure on was bigger in a different
02:54 way it's like people walking down the
02:56 aisle to it and playing and I'd like the
02:57 Olympics or when Obama was getting
03:00 elected president they're playing it you
03:01 know like so far because it's such an
03:04 inspirational song on and and and
03:08 exploded that band Angels and Airwaves
03:10 on to the under the themes where we you
03:12 know to where it's a pretty big band
03:14 this day this is a very big deal you had
03:17 David Kennedy has been with you from the
03:19 start
03:20 I had him on my podcast about six seven
03:24 months ago sat down with him actually
03:26 maybe was like eight or nine months ago
03:27 because I met him at James coffee
03:30 company I have a podcast called I like
03:31 food David's coffee right James coffee
03:35 coming it's really really good I met him
03:38 there in the afternoon and he was like I
03:40 just came from Tom's house and this
03:43 thing might be a go it's like what so we
03:46 talked a little bit about sort of when
03:48 you guys were first you know less than a
03:51 year ago starting to mess around in the
03:53 studio yeah yeah well I started
03:55 recording music again I mean a lot of
03:57 people it's funny there's like two
03:58 groups there's like the hardcore Angels
04:00 and Airwaves fans we've never gone
04:02 anywhere we just we put out music each
04:04 year but we do it on our own way with my
04:06 company to the Stars and the film
04:08 projects and stuff so we do all that and
04:10 then we decided well maybe this it
04:12 honestly was a bandwidth thing the
04:14 company couldn't handle putting out this
04:15 particular record so we went and we put
04:18 it on a label and the label has their
04:21 way of kind of plugging into the mass
04:22 industry and that's why I'm sitting here
04:25 today you know all set everyone's like
04:27 we're
04:27 Ben they're back and I haven't really
04:29 gone anywhere but for most people that
04:31 live normal lives they probably wouldn't
04:33 have been hearing what I've been doing
04:35 necessarily for the Panhandle year so um
04:37 with David it was like okay let's let's
04:39 go do this through you know that's
04:41 really laser focus and bring this back
04:44 in a way that continued what we had what
04:47 we wanted to do which was you know
04:50 motion pictures and animations and
04:53 albums and cross pollinating themes on
04:56 different art just like art mediums you
04:58 know mm-hmm and it's happening and here
05:01 we are and now I'm here it is happening
05:03 it feels like kind of an exciting time
05:06 for you I know you know over the years
05:08 it really Angels and Airwaves like you
05:11 said it feels like it's always been more
05:13 than just a band it's almost like this
05:15 living evolving art project with a
05:18 million arms going out in different
05:20 directions with comic books and films
05:23 and and then to the start like is to the
05:27 Stars part of it and it the Angels and
05:30 Airwaves project and actually first tell
05:32 people exactly what to the Stars is who
05:34 may not know okay so when when Angels
05:36 and Airwaves started I knew that we
05:39 couldn't kind of compete in a way that
05:41 blink-blink was like this kind of
05:42 cultural phenomenon at the time and so
05:45 when I started angels I was like okay
05:47 well I'm not gonna try and pretend I can
05:49 do that again I mean that's like we we
05:50 we we just it was a run the lottery you
05:54 know it just no that never happens yeah
05:57 um so I kind of thought well why don't
05:58 we take themes about the human race and
06:00 we'll and try to get all our tea in our
06:02 own way and well we'll do a movie and
06:05 we'll do books and we'll do albums and
06:07 we'll really try to get large groups of
06:08 artists authors and directors and we're
06:11 all kind of working on one theme
06:12 together and we did that and put out a
06:16 movie called love was kind of our house
06:17 movie and got really great reviews but
06:20 there were like a lot of like punk rock
06:21 fans or like you know what the hell is
06:23 this this is so boring why are we
06:25 watching some guy reading poetry it
06:27 wasn't that bad but but for real like I
06:29 think there were like people I didn't
06:30 totally get what we're doing there I'm
06:31 but in any case we expanded on that we
06:33 needed a company to handle that so we
06:35 created two stars which was essentially
06:38 like a science fiction Disney
06:40 we're where we were a publisher and
06:43 we're a merchandiser and we're a
06:45 production studio so we did we put out
06:47 our second art piece which was called
06:48 poet Anderson this animated short film
06:50 we won best animation at Toronto Film
06:53 Festival these novels and we won really
06:57 dope Awards on the but one called a
06:58 Benjamin Franklin award where oddly
07:00 enough it's it's a science fiction award
07:02 for the best cover and the best story Oh
07:04 kind of stoked because our cover was
07:06 painted by this really great painter but
07:08 in any case um so that was all growing
07:11 and we're moving on okay let's talk
07:13 about poet andersen feature films let's
07:15 talk about the new stuff and we had all
07:16 these things brewing and then one of the
07:20 stories that we were gonna do was called
07:22 secret machines and it's about UFOs okay
07:25 yes but the problem was I took a deep
07:27 breath and said if I'm go out and put
07:30 this story in a hundred million dollar
07:32 motion picture I'm probably going to see
07:35 my car just drive right off a cliff and
07:37 randomly like find me at the bottom of a
07:39 river or something because I was dealing
07:41 with national security secrets okay
07:43 because it was like scary
07:45 seriously series you know okay things I
07:47 knew yeah I can't get into that with you
07:49 - yeah so III figured before I do this I
07:53 should probably go around and ask
07:55 permission and that's what I did soand
07:58 the government so I spent about nine
08:00 months working my way of the Department
08:02 of Defense I'm working my way into
08:04 various three-letter agencies and
08:07 eventually got to the group of generals
08:10 that run the UFO program for the United
08:12 States government
08:13 where are you wearing a diaper that idea
08:15 oh my god no the day that I needed to
08:18 wear a diaper was I thought I got the
08:20 complete sign-off which I did but
08:22 there's other three-letter agencies that
08:24 didn't know like DoD CIA who knows
08:28 amongst others okay and so these other
08:31 groups didn't know that I got brought in
08:34 they just knew that I was on the radio
08:36 doing national press leaking national
08:39 security secrets that were super
08:41 classified so believe it or not I got
08:45 put in a small room up in Del Mar by a
08:49 gentleman from one of these three-letter
08:51 agencies and he's showering me with
08:54 compliments
08:54 about my band and and just loved Angels
08:57 and Airwaves in like 20 minutes into it
08:59 I was like sir I know who you are so
09:02 when you sit here and give me all these
09:03 compliments about my music I'm kind of
09:06 thinking what's the deal here you know I
09:08 I'd taken it with a grain of salt and he
09:11 took a big breath and then leaned back
09:13 in his chair and then he then he then he
09:16 just scoots forward and I remember I
09:18 flinched and he goes I need to know who
09:20 they f you are you know a bunch of stuff
09:22 using bad words that you shouldn't know
09:25 and I need to know why you need to tell
09:27 me why you and I are in this room and
09:29 how you know what you know you know
09:31 another line you know stuff the
09:34 president doesn't know and I need to
09:35 know why that's what I wanted the diary
09:38 oh my god what have I gotten myself into
09:42 because at that point they had no idea
09:44 that I was given this long leash by
09:48 another group and very very very secret
09:51 places to start communicating something
09:55 to the world that's because I pitched an
09:57 idea and it was funny because it all
09:59 started with Angels and Airwaves it was
10:00 like I have a band and we have all we
10:03 have this kind of spiritual core of what
10:05 our band is all about and I have an idea
10:07 that that might really work for you guys
10:09 and it's not about the band but we are
10:11 doing these other films and other if we
10:13 can hit it with music we can hit it with
10:15 films and with books and documentaries
10:18 and we do the whole strategic plan to
10:20 open up you know the first conversations
10:22 disclosure it was a vehicle in a
10:24 mechanism for disclosure and it'll start
10:26 with Angels and Airwaves right but I'm
10:28 also kind of like making this stuff up
10:30 as I meet these guys with multiple stars
10:32 on their shoulders so I'm like yeah and
10:34 we would do this and this is it I don't
10:35 know what I'm talking about I'm I knew
10:37 it could happen but I didn't totally
10:38 know how you know on but it worked and
10:41 what was just Angels and Airwaves the
10:44 band and then the little company called
10:46 to the stars to handle all the film
10:48 projects grew into to the Stars Academy
10:51 of Arts and Science where it's it's an
10:54 entertainment division an aerospace
10:56 division and a science division where
10:59 it's let's tell the stories let's build
11:01 the technology and let's study this with
11:03 the world and so we are tied into
11:06 multiple international governments and
11:08 there
11:09 respective intelligence agencies we are
11:11 partnered with the US government on a
11:13 bunch of things I can't talk about some
11:14 of the stuff I can on and it's like it's
11:17 gone from the stinky little project and
11:19 there's something really really big it's
11:20 what happened was it's like well maybe
11:21 it's time to bring angels and he's back
11:23 you know and because now I have a lot to
11:26 tell people and I've been given a very
11:29 long leash to get this out there and
11:31 today by the way I said it to you before
11:34 oh yeah yeah yeah the Pentagon just
11:36 admitted they're studying UFOs they
11:38 admitted the program existed because we
11:39 forced their hand but now it's on the
11:41 front page of Fox News it's on the front
11:43 page of a bunch of places now on that
11:45 they finally came out and said yes we do
11:47 study these and take these serious first
11:49 time in 70 years okay you know so uh
11:50 it's scary and it's a scary subject it's
11:53 one thing it's all that's cool but when
11:55 you really know it's real
11:56 oh yeah it's it cannot it's kind of
11:57 unnerving no I think it's terrifying and
12:00 fascinating and here's what we're gonna
12:02 do I'm talking with Tom DeLonge here on
12:04 91x Angels and Airwaves have this knew
12:06 all kinds of new music and a new album
12:09 coming out at some point but we're gonna
12:13 do this that we're doing live on the air
12:15 and and we're gonna play some new music
12:17 from Angels and Airwaves and then we're
12:18 gonna take it offline and because I want
12:20 to keep going with you and we'll record
12:22 the rest of our conversation and post
12:24 that at 91 XCOM a little bit later today
12:26 and on all our social media because I am
12:28 fascinated and I feel like we could go
12:31 on and on in fact my husband just texted
12:33 me and he said you guys sound like
12:35 you're straight out of coast-to-coast
12:36 which I'm going to take as a compliment
12:38 that that actually is how that specific
12:41 place heard me was on coast to coast no
12:44 way that's what that guy literally
12:46 almost crashed his car knowing what the
12:49 who's this Rockstar saying on his stuff
12:52 on national radio it was coast to coast
12:53 he heard me okay
12:55 you must have been super excited to get
12:56 on coast to coast - yeah yeah you know
12:58 what I took it seriously you know I live
13:01 grew up listening to that show right all
13:03 right well let's bring it back to Angels
13:05 and Airwaves you you are working on not
13:09 only new music and we have this song
13:10 rebel girl that we love and and it's
13:12 starting to get rolling here on 91x and
13:14 all over the world you guys have been so
13:16 supportive I am so like thankful I told
13:18 you when I walked down it's not easy
13:20 even if you sold a bunch of records
13:22 I've been lucky and fortunate to have
13:24 you know um it's not easy getting a song
13:27 on the radio it's not easy getting
13:28 anyone even hear your song it's like
13:30 it's a big deal to me well right onward
13:32 still I mean it's kind of 491 X it feels
13:35 like a no-brainer and it's a great song
13:37 but Garrett and I we don't have everyone
13:38 right totally know yeah so we're stoked
13:41 but so we'll play that in just a sec but
13:44 really quick you have this new music so
13:47 when kind of can we expect it because
13:51 you said you're still working I was not
13:52 totally done and also the film strange
13:54 times so we actually sold a one of our
13:59 properties strange times we sold that to
14:01 TBS so that's okay that's coming that's
14:03 a big development that's an hour kind of
14:06 an Amblin with an edge okay borders in
14:09 Encinitas it literally all about
14:10 skateboarders that investigate UFOs yeah
14:13 kind of like super bad meets super 8 but
14:16 with the jackass guys you know so I grew
14:19 up a skateboarder so it's but you will
14:21 see like Encinitas on television every
14:23 week that's the movie that's associated
14:26 with this particular album I would tell
14:30 you the name but it but it could change
14:32 and I want to kind of launch that when
14:34 we launched the name of the album but
14:35 this album does go with a motion picture
14:37 okay and I'll be directing I co-wrote
14:39 that movie and I'm directing it and
14:41 we're supposed to be in production
14:42 filming in like three weeks
14:44 right no I have more calls after this
14:46 today to make sure that's actually still
14:49 happening so things are tight in my
14:50 world all right well then speaking of
14:54 will get to this song and and so we can
14:56 get things going and get you out of here
14:59 but the tour we're super stoked you've
15:01 got to I mean they sold out like that
15:03 which I heard angels and arrows at House
15:06 of Blues I was like really that's going
15:08 to take two seconds and it did you know
15:11 we put them all up and I knew that our
15:14 fans were gonna be really excited and
15:16 but that's all I thought you know I but
15:18 I know so I kind of thought it look if
15:20 we go out and just do these club dates
15:21 that would be a really great way to
15:23 communicate the art we've been making
15:25 because we've been we have never stopped
15:27 making music we put out albums and EPS
15:29 and we've been doing tenuously I'm a
15:31 musician first and foremost but I have
15:33 not toured with that band in seven years
15:35 so I kind of figure
15:36 you know and I think these dates will do
15:37 really well we'll probably close them
15:39 out by the time the tour goes out there
15:40 and then we put about and I like saying
15:42 this because I'm really proud of it we
15:44 sold out like half the shows in the
15:45 country in like ten minutes yeah so then
15:48 we upped multiple nights in some cities
15:50 and then we just doubled the size of the
15:52 venue's and others and so most of those
15:54 will all be sold out in the next
15:55 probably two weeks or so I hope yeah um
15:57 but what this is leading up to is
16:00 bringing I'm really been pushing hard to
16:02 bring Angels and Airwaves back you know
16:04 not back but to get it into an arena
16:06 into a big place because that's really
16:08 what I always had in mind 12 years ago I
16:11 told everybody we're making movies
16:12 animations books science fiction stuff
16:15 it's all gonna come to life together and
16:17 people are like right on your hi blink
16:20 182 when you're talking about aliens
16:24 you're literally lost the plot but now
16:27 people are like oh my god maybe he's not
16:29 that crazy right it's crazy that what if
16:31 he's right this is scary no I know and
16:33 so I want to dive into that too but do
16:35 you mean so have it in an arena so it
16:37 can be like a people need audio-visual
16:41 everything multimedia all the animations
16:45 all the films even you know we my
16:48 company and I released the first three
16:51 videos of UFOs ever Declassified by
16:53 Unites States government ever and we did
16:55 that of the stars and stars did yeah I
16:59 pregnancy but I I had a very particular
17:01 meeting at a very particular place okay
17:03 and and I was given the videos and I was
17:06 like get these out and we did and we
17:08 took them to the New York Times and we
17:10 did this big thing for six weeks with
17:12 them and then it came out across the
17:13 board on the Washington Post New York
17:15 Times everywhere yeah like but even
17:17 those will come to life in the show you
17:19 know the animations the movies all that
17:21 stuff but to do that you kind of need a
17:23 bigger production yeah you need to have
17:25 more people and it was always though it
17:27 was always the trajectory how do we take
17:29 Angels and Airwaves to do this kind of
17:30 modern Pink Floyd the wall thing um even
17:35 though we're nothing like Pink Floyd but
17:36 it's the idea of being able to branch
17:38 out of just an audio exercise and I
17:41 think that this is all leading up to
17:42 that this is how you know not so much
17:45 the tour we're doing in the fall but
17:47 it's about next summer
17:48 that's why I'm going to the movie now
17:50 doing the movie now and that's what I've
17:52 been working on so hard for 12 years
17:54 with this band even when people thought
17:55 we weren't around but we were still
17:57 doing stuff mm-hmm
17:58 so if all goes right we'll have
18:01 something pretty pretty amazing to bring
18:03 out to the world next summer that's the
18:04 goal that's super exciting well yeah
18:06 two sold-out 91x shows October fifth and
18:09 six House of Blues with angels and
18:11 airwaves and then yeah maybe it's the
18:13 China can Qualcomm whatever okay let's
18:22 play rebel girl this is the first new
18:23 someone we've gotten new music from you
18:25 guys in a long time and and we're super
18:27 stoked to have it on 91x thank you for
18:29 being here if you want to hear more of
18:31 Tom and is my conversation we're gonna
18:33 take it offline and keep going and we
18:35 will share that later
18:36 at 91 XCOM rebel girl new Angels and
18:40 Airwaves it is 91x
18:43 let's keep going you want to I'm just
18:46 recording into here so we are off the
18:48 air and that is done you'd like how
18:55 about you I have questions too like it's
19:00 not only about what you want to know do
19:05 the stars so I have I've been there
19:07 because you have a storefront right next
19:10 to good on yeah yeah for like six
19:15 dollars yeah oh my god I had like a
19:17 breakfast burrito it's like 17 dollars
19:20 like black beans but they were really
19:24 good one there's sue the best black
19:25 beans I've ever had but it is yummy but
19:28 so did you open the store front there
19:30 and Encinitas just for a place kind of
19:32 is it like a headquarters like do you
19:33 know everything so if you go shop yeah
19:37 if you go up to Encinitas on the 101 at
19:38 the beach there's a you'll see little
19:40 cafe I mean we're right next door to
19:42 that and we have our retail store in
19:44 there you'll see all of our books you'll
19:46 see all the merchandise behind that is
19:49 all of offices you have our aerospace
19:50 stuff you have our produce we have a
19:55 show dropping in like thirty first I
20:01 know
20:02 gonna want to see and and so that's
20:04 their produced they're all the my office
20:08 and all that kind of stuff I mean
20:09 everything we do our warehouse is back
20:10 there so kind of traces around the back
20:12 of the whole building complex okay cool
20:14 that's super cool I don't know yeah if
20:16 it was just a little shop storefront or
20:18 if you know it's funny I wanted a place
20:20 on I used to run the technology company
20:25 that we service like all the fan clubs
20:27 and pay-per-view and all that kind of
20:29 stuff for Jack White's company Third Man
20:31 Records hands and then we did it for
20:33 Pearl Jam was that like an offshoot of
20:36 mod life room totally different oh yeah
20:39 and so on what I loved about Jack
20:42 White's setup out in Nashville is he had
20:45 a little store and it was a place where
20:48 people that were big fans of what he
20:49 does was were able to come there and
20:51 kind of you know it's like a place to
20:54 come in and touch things and feel things
20:55 and and and kind of visit you know the
20:58 the stomping grounds of one of their
21:00 favorite artists so I kind of thought
21:01 it'd be good for our company to do this
21:03 yeah and it helped us just to have you
21:07 know it helps pay for the place just to
21:09 have a little retail store there too so
21:10 it made sense and so we got people to
21:12 travel all over the world to come out
21:14 there it's really cool that is cool ya
21:16 know it's me I mean it's like little but
21:18 it is super cool yeah it's meant to me
21:20 we're gonna have to move though I mean
21:21 we're gonna be growing a lot over the
21:23 next two years which which kind of sucks
21:25 got such a great little location but it
21:27 is no more six dollar kombucha I know
21:29 what are we gonna do you can have a door
21:31 - over to you or something okay so I
21:33 want to go back to the very beginning
21:35 because now we can kind of talk about
21:36 this I mean I know we talked about the
21:40 music and and all of this combined but I
21:42 want to dive more into your interest in
21:45 extraterrestrial life and the realities
21:49 that we're dealing with that aren't
21:50 really talked about by our government
21:51 and in in pop culture they're just sort
21:54 of imagined or whatever when did you
21:57 first start to believe that you know
22:02 that that aliens existed or that there
22:05 was something and I have I want to tell
22:06 you I believe it - I think it's hubris I
22:09 think it's ridiculous for us to think
22:12 that were the only things in existence
22:14 in this universe stood
22:15 mystically alone there's got to be
22:18 something else I sort of wonder if there
22:21 could be aliens in this room and but
22:23 they're so outside of our consciousness
22:25 right that we can't even perceive that
22:29 they're here but when did you yeah when
22:31 did you get interested in it when did
22:33 you really start to believe the way you
22:36 were just saying all that is why I got
22:37 way into this and why my band and and
22:40 having a little bit more say about kind
22:42 of the artistic highway that I wanted to
22:45 be on um was because of that type of
22:48 thinking everything that you just said
22:49 it's I I was always so inquisitive and I
22:52 was always I grew up in a really
22:54 dysfunctional home and a broken family
22:56 and I was like I'm gonna get tattoos and
22:58 start a punk rock band you know but on
23:00 the reality was is I was always thinking
23:02 there had to be so much more than this I
23:04 mean this idea that I hate school and
23:06 I'm gonna work at a job nine-to-five and
23:08 sell insurance or something and hate my
23:10 life just gotta be more you know so I
23:12 got really fascinated um and what else
23:15 there could be like even as a kid I did
23:17 when I was like probably in junior high
23:19 I started trying to find books that I
23:21 first book I found was like UFOs and
23:23 Loch Ness monster or something and was
23:25 like well that's oh it's weird thing
23:26 about ghosts or something yeah and that
23:29 that was the beginnings of my love of
23:30 science fiction and all things George
23:32 Lucas and all that kind of stuff um but
23:35 I think I was always I think I was
23:38 always a very spiritual person and what
23:39 that means to me is um I think a lot of
23:41 people in San Diego would recognize
23:43 those types of words more so than maybe
23:46 other areas of the world but um what
23:48 that means to me is that I I kind of
23:50 believe that consciousness and who we
23:52 are as people are tied to something much
23:54 greater and has a lot more to do with
23:56 the universe literally the physical unit
23:58 and we can begin to imagine yes and I
24:01 wanted to really explore that stuff and
24:03 I knew that once you start thinking
24:05 about what is consciousness and who are
24:07 we as human beings and how are we
24:09 connected to each other and is there a
24:11 soul and what does that mean and all
24:13 that kind of stuff you have to start
24:14 thinking about well the universe's and
24:16 as an entire organism must all operate a
24:21 certain way and there must be a lot more
24:23 that's out there than just earth itself
24:25 so I got really into all these large
24:28 concepts
24:29 and books and studies that would take my
24:32 mind out of traffic and going to school
24:35 everyday or being on tour in a van you
24:37 know for hours there you know 12 hours
24:39 at a time just starting to trying to
24:41 understand you know who are we and where
24:44 do we come from and where are we going
24:45 and all that and when you study the UFO
24:47 stuff
24:49 it takes you right down into the heart
24:51 of all of this stuff it's people think
24:53 you just study about spaceship has
24:54 nothing I mean you any UFO book isn't
24:57 even about this you can find ones on
24:59 sightings but no one really cares about
25:01 that you're usually reading about
25:02 ancient religious texts you're reading
25:04 about consciousness you're reading about
25:05 esoteric physics a lot of stuff that's
25:08 really academic that's kind of hard to
25:09 digest to be honest and I wanted Angels
25:12 and Airwaves to kind of be the mechanism
25:14 to explore all that stuff but what are
25:16 gonna do when you just rhyme a few lines
25:18 in a song you know to me it's like books
25:20 and movies and all this stuff it can all
25:22 work together and this is me being
25:23 ambitious and this is me saying I'll all
25:25 aim for the stars but maybe I just land
25:28 on the moon but at least I got a little
25:30 bit further than most and so I got
25:32 really into this stuff and the funny
25:33 thing is is I think um you know I wasn't
25:36 just a guy that created a band they had
25:38 all the space imagery you know angels I
25:40 always like our website had space and
25:42 stars and our t-shirts had space and
25:43 stars you know but it wasn't really
25:45 gimmick because I probably am the only
25:48 guy that went and create an aerospace
25:49 company and I dealing with the the most
25:54 as a side gig defied space secrets you
25:58 know and then I came back and said okay
26:00 figured that out I got it it's all
26:02 unlocked now let's go next record
26:04 alright but it's fascinating stuff
26:07 I mean is fascinating if you I mean
26:09 either the stuff I have in my head that
26:12 I can't talk about anymore it's just
26:13 absolutely unreal I mean it's like I
26:16 thought I knew a lot and then there was
26:18 one meeting I had where somebody goes
26:20 let me just tell you what you're [ __ ]
26:22 with let me just let you know and they
26:24 said something and and I didn't sleep
26:26 for three nights and I'm like oh my god
26:28 I won't see I was going to ask you are
26:31 you able to sleep knowing the things you
26:33 sometimes know but most of the time yeah
26:36 I mean I think it's one of those things
26:38 like you know Isis is bad right now
26:40 al-qaeda is bad
26:42 right they do really bad stuff you know
26:44 that's out there and you know there's
26:45 people dealing with the brunt of that
26:46 for you so you can go to the mall and
26:48 stuff on weekends so I think when people
26:51 want to create conspiracies and point
26:52 fingers at the government you know take
26:54 the politics out of it um but just look
26:57 at the the tried and true career civil
26:59 servants you know these guys I mean I've
27:02 been to the Pentagon and and I've I've
27:04 been in meetings there and I've met the
27:07 people that you know I was told if I
27:09 ever learned their name I'd have to take
27:11 it to the grave you know and these guys
27:13 have the fingernails shoot off all on
27:15 all our fingers I mean the stress is
27:16 just unreal you know because they are
27:19 studying exploring dealing with just all
27:22 types of threats including the UFO
27:25 phenomenon you know and it's not really
27:27 if it is a phenomenon but it's
27:29 phenomenon to most okay do you feel like
27:33 you have in your all your meetings and
27:37 all your studies you are a hundred
27:39 percent convinced that not only is there
27:42 alien life but what that ufos have come
27:46 into our atmosphere have landed on like
27:49 one trillion percent okay complete I've
27:51 seen things know things okay that 99.99%
27:55 of the people will never get access to
27:57 yes it's don't it doesn't matter if you
28:00 believe it or not it's here real yeah
28:02 it's coming okay it's meaning the
28:04 subject you know uh-huh we don't know
28:06 everything about it we know some things
28:08 about it there's a lot more questions
28:10 than answers on but uh but you know you
28:13 know trying to bring it back to the band
28:16 a little bit because if I don't do this
28:18 my sister's gonna chop my head off the
28:20 whole point of what I'm trying to do as
28:22 an artist now is bridge bridge that gap
28:25 where you take something that's totally
28:28 unbelievable and make it palatable for
28:31 people to understand and it works well
28:33 with the ban and what I want to do there
28:35 because I want to be an artist that
28:38 plays with these themes and and and does
28:41 things that's better challenging and
28:42 unifies people and get something
28:44 differently so that all really works
28:46 well and it also works for a lot of our
28:48 government partners because they don't
28:49 have a mechanism to talk about stuff
28:51 that's hard like without like dropping
28:54 upon and freaking everybody yeah
28:56 and it's like you know they don't I mean
28:57 they're there to deal with issues
28:59 they're not there to turn I mean the
29:00 user it's kind of like they're it's like
29:02 you know if there's just making up a
29:05 story like imagine like they caught some
29:07 dude trying to sneak a nuclear weapon
29:09 and do the border of through the border
29:10 of Canada do you expect them to stop
29:13 hold a press conference sit on your like
29:15 your sofa and go this is what we found
29:17 we don't know where it's from everyone
29:19 might die you know just like no get back
29:22 to work
29:22 call me when you're done when you have a
29:24 second you don't want them to stop and
29:26 deal with talking to you about it nor
29:27 should they you know then you throw on a
29:30 subject that they they're they don't
29:32 know everything about it and they and it
29:34 takes a long time to figure this stuff
29:36 out sure this isn't just like spend the
29:38 next 12 months and try and trace where
29:40 people bought wires and plutonium it's
29:42 like spend the next 70 years and let's
29:44 let's try to figure out what the hell
29:47 has been going on on earth for thousands
29:49 of years you know so by you like kind of
29:52 having their permission for lack of a
29:55 better word or blessing to be a little
29:59 more open about these things that you
30:01 know and that that the government and
30:03 these different agencies are okay with
30:05 you have given you the green light to
30:06 share for you it serves a purpose
30:08 because you are an artist and so you can
30:11 create it's an artistic expression of
30:15 all these things that you know it's like
30:16 the culmination of all this knowledge
30:18 and all this information but also for
30:21 them it's like a way to introduce it -
30:24 yeah and it's full without it's hard for
30:26 people to sometimes because they look
30:28 and they go they it'd be nice to call
30:30 the government them but it's not one
30:33 functioning organism
30:34 it's literally like you know I like
30:37 Disney bought Marvel and Marvel Disney's
30:40 three hundred billion dollars and
30:41 Marvel's probably thirty fifty billion
30:43 at this point they're so big they're
30:45 both giant and does Disney and Marvel
30:48 talk about everything or does Disney
30:50 call them up and say we want you to give
30:52 us this accounting report and they're
30:54 like we'll get to it and we can or I
30:55 can't call the guy and get the reports
30:57 and he says that we don't legally have
31:00 to give it to you and and they're you
31:01 know he could picture they even though
31:04 Disney owns them doesn't mean that they
31:05 kind of run their own thing that's 50 31:08 billion dollar division right so think
31:10 about
31:10 the government that way that look how
31:12 hard it is for Trump to tell them not to
31:14 give away his taxes you know it's like
31:16 they're all arguing about it and you
31:18 thought he was in charge not really you
31:20 know so in the government you have a lot
31:22 of different places with and it's a
31:24 trillion dollar company think of it that
31:26 way it literally is like a trillion a
31:27 year you're probably spending on all
31:28 this stuff they're classified budgets
31:30 and in white world budgets it does not
31:33 mean that the Air Force is gonna do what
31:36 the Navy wants them to do it doesn't
31:37 mean that the CIA wants to share all
31:40 their stuff with the guys over at naval
31:42 Intel it doesn't mean that the White
31:44 House even knows what you know the
31:47 Department of Defense has been doing
31:48 since World War two you know unless they
31:50 knew the question to ask okay so you've
31:53 got to think of different places with
31:54 different budgets doing their own stuff
31:56 one of the things that I did with my
31:58 band was I put together a vehicle that
32:03 allowed on kind of a loud conversation
32:05 to take place with a lot of different
32:07 people from different places so if you
32:09 look at the team my company you know
32:11 it's one of the head guys from Lockheed
32:14 Martin skunk works I mean the skunk
32:16 works built area 51 you know for the u-2 32:19 spy plane but I also have Chris Mellon
32:22 was under secretary defense for
32:24 intelligence third in command of the
32:25 Pentagon it works for to this time oh
32:28 yeah he's the chairman of the his boss
32:31 Tom not Chris is because Chris Chris is
32:34 the chairman of the scientific advisory
32:36 board so he's involved and everything
32:39 our company does but he he doesn't but
32:41 you know who does work for me and I like
32:43 to say this because funny is that Lou
32:46 Elizondo did run the government's UFO
32:48 program up until about it 18 months ago
32:50 and he does work for me and so I kind of
32:53 go well that's kind of cool you know but
32:55 yeah but my partner Jim is CIA you know
32:57 he's he's he was a spy it's entire line
33:01 them until last year I think and but
33:06 he's what's called a senior intelligence
33:07 service which is like a two-star general
33:09 equivalent like the talk like pinch
33:14 yourself do you ever like pinch yourself
33:15 like that come this far for you is the
33:17 coolest thing in the world yeah and that
33:20 you're legitimized because you know
33:23 like people thought us not well right
33:25 and aliens exist like haha funny song
33:27 you know I mean totally yeah so so then
33:30 like when do you recall a moment where
33:33 you realized you were finally being seen
33:37 as legitimate and in people you respect
33:39 his eyes like they were finally taking
33:41 you seriously yeah I think it was when
33:43 you might not know about this moment
33:44 maybe you do Darren I don't know but I
33:46 do know when Wall Street Journal wrote a
33:50 story because when all the WikiLeaks
33:52 emails leaked when John Podesta stuff
33:55 god yes yes my emails were in there
33:58 right because I was having conversations
34:00 and everyone know in the article of the
34:02 Wall Street Journal they're all go Tom
34:03 DeLonge is talking about aliens with
34:06 these multi star generals in John
34:08 Podesta and Hillary Clinton's campaign I
34:11 was like no John Podesta was Obama
34:13 senior adviser to so these were
34:16 discussions aimed at the White House and
34:18 when that came out it was about handful
34:22 of months after I said I was working
34:23 with some important people and no one
34:25 believed me at the time they literally
34:26 thought I was nuts so when this came out
34:29 there was pretty big validation but the
34:31 the the other really big validation was
34:33 when we came out with the New York Times
34:35 article when we got those videos
34:38 Declassified and were able to start the
34:40 discussion and we outed the program and
34:43 that was that was not an easy thing to
34:46 do and a lot of people were really
34:48 pissed but then a lot of people were
34:50 calling us up from the you from from
34:52 whether it be the agency a CIA or the
34:55 DoD calling up our partner saying this
34:56 is incredible thank god you guys pulled
35:00 this off you have all of our support and
35:01 even multi star generals we're in on it
35:04 up to like the Joint Chiefs level were
35:05 like this is where they want it to
35:07 happen but there's a lot of people who
35:08 weren't ready for that conversation -
35:10 sure um but you know I was pinching
35:12 myself and it all boils down to again it
35:15 all started with this band Angels and
35:17 heroin yeah and I'm not even just trying
35:19 to throw in the shameless plug I'm like
35:20 nobody real you're right I see that it
35:23 started with me pitching stories that
35:26 would go along on these big concept
35:28 albums and movies but the difference was
35:30 that I wasn't trying to do vanity
35:32 projects with the stories I was like how
35:35 do we make a move how do we do a theme
35:36 that crosses the boundaries of features
35:39 and books and now loses everyone's
35:41 communicating the same theme but let the
35:43 movie be a movie and let the album be an
35:44 album like every piece has to stand on
35:46 its own this doesn't have to be like I'm
35:49 not really trying to do Pink Floyd the
35:50 wall again you know let's let's make a
35:52 movie that can live as a feature and
35:55 every every Sinopoli
35:57 worth AMC Theaters or what is't snob
35:59 looking when I'm near me I don't know
36:00 I'm a big fan of a lot you guys a lot
36:05 once you put your address on it I don't
36:07 know I should I live right next door in
36:09 the little blue house but um but it all
36:11 started with the ambitions of how do I
36:13 take this band and do something
36:15 different and I was thinking I could
36:17 pull it off in like four or five years
36:18 and I was like twelve I was like this
36:20 was hard
36:22 so then especially now I must feel so
36:25 good they're like here it is we've got
36:27 this music like it's it is it really
36:29 does feel like more cohesive maybe well
36:32 everything's you know it's funny I just
36:33 did like three interviews last week in a
36:37 row and I remember one was like enemy
36:39 was crying it was rock sound us all UK
36:43 based stuff but each interview the
36:45 person said quote like wow the stars are
36:49 really aligning not you and everything
36:51 you're doing right now yeah and I
36:52 remember but by the third time I heard
36:54 that I was so happy like because I I has
36:58 no one understood why I wasn't in blink
37:00 anymore and then no one understood why I
37:04 was singing songs about love and
37:06 consciousness when angels were started
37:08 and then no one understood the UFO thing
37:10 at all they just thought I was literally
37:11 nuts and so so much of when all my
37:13 government partners came on was like we
37:15 need to we need people to see you more
37:17 as an Elon Musk and less is who you
37:19 really are you know and I'm like well
37:21 you mean like thirty billion dollars
37:23 then because that's what he has right
37:24 but I'm right but I it's been a long
37:27 road to try to get people to understand
37:30 you know I it's the other thing too is
37:33 I'm a punk rock you I do what I want
37:35 mm-hmm I really don't care what people
37:37 say and I think it really angers a lot
37:38 of the fans oh the fans it's opeth it's
37:42 just like you know we keep telling you
37:44 you're an [ __ ] and you suck why are
37:45 you keep doing this stuff you know but I
37:47 think now they're in
37:50 I think they're seeing a lot of stuff
37:51 you know like they're seeing the
37:53 creative differences in what I do and
37:55 what my brothers in blink do like
37:57 different things we like different music
37:59 on but we're still good friends and we
38:01 still support each other and it hit the
38:04 press last weekend yes yeah yes
38:07 everybody I will play with blink again
38:09 yeah I talked to people who are losing
38:11 their minds that's fine no but that's
38:14 the whole plan I mean you Travis you're
38:17 gonna say and no I talk to Travis all
38:18 time and I talked to Marc just the other
38:20 day and there were we're always
38:23 discussing what makes sense and when you
38:25 know and but for me it was funny but
38:28 when I was starting all this stuff
38:30 working with people that were in the
38:32 government I I couldn't tell those guys
38:34 so they didn't know and I was one of the
38:36 reasons why they got so upset I think
38:38 was you know they're like let's go
38:40 record and let's go do all the awkward
38:42 right now I'm doing something you mean
38:45 you were still in blink when this whole
38:48 meltdown happened it's like Tom quit Tom
38:51 didn't quit and now somebody else is
38:53 playing him blink and everyone hated
38:55 each other and all that stuff all that
38:56 happened was because I couldn't tell
38:58 anybody who I was working with I
38:59 couldn't tell anybody what I was working
39:01 on that must have been really hard it
39:03 was hard because at that point is if
39:05 anyway I was I remember saying to some
39:07 problem off anyone just knew the
39:09 enormity of what I'm putting together
39:11 right now if they have any concept that
39:14 for the first time in the history of
39:16 mankind
39:17 I created a mechanism to have the
39:20 conversation and not only the mechanism
39:23 like I'm driving the [ __ ] car you
39:26 know I'm like on the front seat or
39:28 riding shotgun on the single most
39:32 scariest fascinating secretive
39:35 potentially revolutionary revolutionary
39:37 everything dealing with the tech what
39:39 say well anti-gravity and and other
39:41 species in the universe and interactions
39:44 on the earth and what that means or what
39:46 this thing even could be and all that
39:48 like everything that comes along with it
39:50 and it all again it was all meant to
39:53 fall in line behind what angels and
39:57 Airways was trying to do which was
39:59 spearhead these big conversations
40:02 through
40:03 art who art so but art does that no you
40:06 want honestly this is how this is crazy
40:08 I remember the main bhi mein general the
40:12 guy the guy who holds the keys you know
40:14 okay I remember I went out and gave this
40:17 for our presentation about you know why
40:20 he should consider working with me and
40:23 he was just quiet rocking in his chair
40:25 with his hand on his chin the whole time
40:27 and I remember I was exhausted after
40:29 four hours of how I laid out the entire
40:31 thing how are you holding out hello and
40:34 what you well how I ran the vision okay
40:37 how this would work okay
40:38 and that's like movies and books and
40:41 nonfiction books documentaries the album
40:43 and the tour and how it travels around
40:44 and the messaging and how you
40:46 communicate to young people like it was
40:48 like like I'm pitching the iPhone before
40:50 the iPhone got made you know this is how
40:51 it works and at the end he stands up
40:54 shakes my hand I was really pleasure
40:56 meeting you and I'm like that's it
40:58 that's it
40:59 pleasure meeting you I'm like okay all
41:00 right what do I say what I say is I
41:02 gotta go and he left and I was a broken
41:04 man I was abroad like I got so close I
41:06 met the guy and and I remember he was
41:10 like it's not real none of its real but
41:12 I really enjoyed your yours and I was
41:14 going oh my god so I fly home and I'm at
41:18 the airport and I wrote an email to him
41:20 and I said general please consider for
41:24 once just one line I beg of you and and
41:26 I and I said this one thing to him I
41:28 remembered at the moment that I got the
41:31 time I used to wear an Air Force hat um
41:32 and he was a general with Space Command
41:36 and I remember I said at that moment I
41:39 said I wonder if there's I wonder if
41:41 there's like a cool quote with the Air
41:43 Force I looked up with a teacher in the
41:45 bootcamp and it says a great per all you
41:47 always do what's right even at great
41:49 personal cost you know something to that
41:52 effect and so I put that in the email
41:54 yeah just a Hail Mary I just went on the
41:56 internet like is there any cool quote
41:57 associated with the Air Force you know
41:59 and I found this quote and I threw it in
42:01 there heard nothing get on the plane I
42:04 fly home I'll and I'm driving home I get
42:07 off in Del Mar I do exit in Del Mar and
42:10 I'm in my truck and all sudden my final
42:12 my phone goes
42:13 and I look over and I see there's an
42:15 email from him my heart goes like crazy
42:17 and I pull the truck over it just got
42:20 dark put on my hazards so I remember
42:21 there's like all these red lights
42:23 blinking I opened up the email and he
42:26 responded to to what I said and he goes
42:28 I wonder if there's any time to stop the
42:31 pressing of your books and then he then
42:33 the next paragraph I can't tell you what
42:34 he said but he said maybe there's some
42:37 room in the story for this boom boom
42:39 boom boom boom and I swear to you I
42:41 almost pissed my pants my heart was
42:43 going a thousand miles per hour and I go
42:45 holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] it worked how do i
42:50 okay what do I say next what do I say
42:51 next and so for the next startling more
42:53 quotes next six months was just like it
42:56 was crazy I had to really think through
42:58 what I say when I say you can't ask
43:00 about classified programs sure um so I
43:02 had to keep things largely two things I
43:04 don't want to get in any situation where
43:06 you'd say [ __ ] you I'll never talk to
43:07 you again and I learned how to have an
43:10 enormous honor respect and humility and
43:12 then I had to execute everything said
43:13 that I pitched and I had to get it done
43:16 and I did and I it was just the most
43:18 wonderful wonderful thing you know but
43:21 when the when the emails leaked that
43:23 shut that valve right off I was and I
43:26 said it's on the History Channel show
43:28 that's right
43:29 it's in there I'm talking all about all
43:30 this stuff and I go I had one rule there
43:32 was only one rule do not let the names
43:35 leak of the people I'm working with and
43:38 then it leaked because Julian Assange
43:41 imagine like a pipeline faucet and water
43:48 I was finally getting the stuff out that
43:51 the people needed you know so um but
43:56 what happened because of that Wall
43:57 Street Journal article was that all the
44:00 people around me now sought me out
44:03 because they said you're the real deal
44:05 gotcha and so now I have to the stars
44:07 Academy so everything happens for a
44:08 reason you know yeah but I'm dad story

44:52 getting it off the ground okay and so
44:54 far they're super excited about this
44:56 if this happens on my love of baseball
44:59 will be seen in a really really big way
45:02 oh my god really cool okay cool I can't
45:04 wait for that I hope it does come to
45:06 fruition and then finally this show
45:09 unidentified I wrote it down inside
45:11 America's UFO investigation right that's
45:13 the name of it yep so you said History
45:15 Channel History Channel it airs on the
45:17 31st May or June of this month okay like
45:21 what is like a couple weeks or ten days
45:22 or something and it's a serious serious
45:24 and you know if you remember a couple
45:27 weeks ago it leaked that then released
45:30 from Congress that the Navy was putting
45:33 together a formal reporting mechanism
45:34 for UFOs mm-hmm that was us so to the
45:37 Stars has been briefing the Senate and
45:39 Congress and various oversight
45:42 committees for the past year and so all
45:44 the people were bringing to them to
45:45 brief the Senators and stuff we're all
45:48 current pilots and pilots that are in
45:51 the Navy now that have been intercepting
45:53 these crafts and stuff well we would
45:55 find them we would debrief them and we
45:58 would do it all on camera and then we
45:59 would take them and let them brief the
46:01 Senate and what resulted from all that
46:04 was us helping guide new national
46:06 security policy on this in draft
46:08 language and oversight bills and so that
46:10 leaked a couple weeks ago that that was
46:12 happening but that was to the Stars that
46:13 was us oh my god and that's all on the
46:15 series you've got to be so proud of that
46:17 oh good okay
46:18 so well then I'm excited to have shows
46:20 that there's stuff in there that's like
46:22 wow talk about like this is this is
46:24 going to make people kind of understand

46:28 that I want you that's all my team
46:30 members okay I'm the producer or
46:31 directed it okay clumb yeah but it's all

46:43 finally if people want to learn more
46:45 about what to the Stars what you are
46:48 doing I know there's always like Angels
46:50 and Airwaves calm and all of your social
46:53 but but for the the to the Stars stuff
46:56 do they just go to your website or their
46:57 best thing is always to follow my
47:00 socials on Instagram and Twitter
47:02 obviously dogs and cars that kind of
47:04 which by the way is that not funny it's
47:06 it's the best thing I ate more I'm I
47:08 don't want to piss people off so I but
47:13 outside of those super important posts
47:15 there are other things I'm breaking is
47:18 groundbreaking so we follow my socials
47:20 for Tom DeLonge and Instagram and
47:21 Twitter and all that stuff so all the to
47:22 the stars Academy stuff is on there but
47:24 also to the stars academy.com
47:26 okay and the to the stars dot media
47:30 though is where we have like all of our
47:32 products and books and t-shirts and
47:33 Angels and Airwaves records and all that
47:35 kind of stuff Angels and Airwaves is a
47:38 division of to the stars Academy it's
47:41 kind of the road show so if I have it my
47:44 way all the aerospace all the science
47:47 all the data all the information all the
47:49 projects the ones that that can be
47:52 discussed would be a part of that
47:55 extravaganza that circus going forward
47:58 so that's what we're gearing up for um
48:00 but I will say this you asked me really
48:02 quickly I will say my last thing is um
48:04 I'm super passionate about Angels and
48:07 Airwaves because we've always been
48:08 pretty diverse than the types of songs
48:10 to create Alex for a punk rock kids
48:11 really I feel pretty not it's not
48:14 pigeon-holed too much it always sounds
48:16 kind of like me you know but I'm this
48:20 next record really is going to be the

00:00 and it hits me oh my gosh this is that
00:02 triangle you know there's explanation
00:04 for everything that occurred in the
00:05 Rendlesham forest incident it was
00:09 completely silent it comes right over
00:12 our heads it's also really standing in
00:16 the clearing he turned over to my father
00:18 and held his hand and he looked in his
00:20 eyes and said we're not alone welcome to
00:26 podcast UFO for our live show during the
00:29 show feel free to participate live in
00:31 our chat room and don't forget to Like
00:34 us on our very active Facebook page
00:37 hello and welcome to the show we have a
00:40 Lois Elizondo with us today probably
00:44 don't need to say too much about him I'm
00:47 sure if you've been watching this topic
00:49 you know exactly who he is here and a
00:51 tip and we're gonna be talking about
00:53 that and so much more
00:55 welcome to the show Liu thank you for
00:57 having me okay so let's tackle this hard
01:01 question right off the bat last year and
01:04 MUFON I remember you saying to everyone
01:07 in the audience to be skeptical and so
01:10 what do you think about the people who
01:11 are skeptical about you and that you had
01:14 any involvement in a tip in particular
01:18 let's see there was an article that
01:21 recently came out
01:24 Keith Klaus article and it's saying that
01:27 I believe the Secretary of Defense for
01:31 intelligence the name was Sherwood said
01:35 that he didn't think that you were
01:38 involved with the a tip program any time
01:42 at all sure well first and foremost look
01:47 in today's day of media it look
01:50 everyone's entitled to the minute and
01:51 and not everyone is necessarily going to
01:54 agree with or even lying quiet what what
01:56 we're doing and especially I think when
01:59 we're talking about speaking about
02:00 topics as rich and potentially as as
02:04 obscure and contentious at times as UFOs
02:07 and because of that people are always
02:09 going to have to try to poke holes in a
02:12 story I get it that's that
02:14 just what the media does but I'm very
02:17 confident along with others that are in
02:19 senior positions of the US government of
02:22 my of my credentials the Department of
02:25 Defense is a large bureaucracy and
02:27 sometimes it takes time for information
02:29 to trickle down so this may very well be
02:32 one of those cases and you know frankly
02:35 I'm pretty optimistic that at some point
02:37 here there their position may change
02:39 again so it's not an unfortunate I wish
02:41 I wish I'd say it's unusual but but
02:43 sometimes it takes a while for
02:45 information to keeping in mind for the
02:47 last year and a half they had already
02:48 said for the record that I think she was
02:51 part of the program so you know I think
02:54 they probably got their wires crossed
02:55 somewhere when you read articles like
02:58 this does it discourage you and make you
03:00 want to just you know turn away from
03:03 this whole thing no I mean people are
03:07 entitled to their opinions and this and
03:08 it's going to continue to happen I think
03:10 that look we live in a society where
03:13 everybody has a right to an opinion it
03:15 doesn't matter how goofy or or or
03:18 serious it is and I think that's what
03:20 makes our society so so great so now
03:23 people are gonna have have opinions I
03:24 just had a penis for the last 70 years
03:26 on this topic quite frankly so do I
03:28 think that that opinions are going to
03:30 change us because I happen to be the the
03:32 person who sure on this topic no
03:34 absolutely not I think it's you know
03:36 this is I hate to say but it says
03:38 American as apple pie and you know
03:41 that's what happens when you live in a
03:42 free society we allow everybody to have
03:44 a voice I watched this screener for
03:47 unidentified and I was thrilled by how
03:50 well it was produced and I thought the
03:53 content was great and what it revealed
03:56 and everything and I think the nimitz
03:59 may prove to be one of the most
04:00 important encounters a lot of it had to
04:04 do the notoriety had to do with the
04:06 videos and you know a couple of videos
04:08 came out we have a very visual society
04:11 anyway and are there gonna be more
04:13 videos coming out that we can eventually
04:16 get to see well certainly but let me
04:20 define you know coming out on this
04:22 particular series or the next episode
04:25 you know and I think I think
04:27 videos will be coming out yes but not
04:29 necessarily through our show immediately
04:33 because at the end of the day videos are
04:34 just one aspect of many many many when
04:37 you're trying to - who will build a case
04:39 on something you know eyewitness
04:41 testimony is very important video is
04:43 very important radar data is very
04:45 important electro-optical dated gun
04:46 camera footage is very important and
04:49 it's it's a much bigger story than just
04:51 a video or two or three videos i think
04:53 the viewer will appreciate as you begin
04:55 to watch more and more of these you will
04:58 you will begin to realize that this is a
05:01 much much bigger much more comprehensive
05:04 and nigma that we are facing and
05:07 although videos are neat because people
05:09 look at how that look at that thing
05:12 this is this is much more compelling and
05:14 when you begin to actually listen to the
05:16 eyewitnesses these are men and women who
05:18 are still active duty in uniform and and
05:20 you see what the the struggle that and
05:23 and potentially in some cases even even
05:26 putting them in harm's way and then had
05:29 this discussion in front of the American
05:31 people I think people will begin to
05:33 realize this is a very this is a very
05:35 interesting question that we knew that
05:37 we need to answers to this and yeah
05:39 there's a national security aspect
05:40 edition it's not just hey I saw
05:43 something flying when I was flying my
05:44 f-18 and I think as we continue with a
05:47 few more of these episodes it's going to
05:49 become very very apparent that that this
05:52 is truly a global phenomena was there a
05:54 certain event that made you decide to
05:56 quit the Department of Defense or was
06:00 this something that just came about
06:02 gradually well first of all if I may be
06:06 frank with you personally speaking I've
06:09 seen and know too much at this point to
06:11 simply ignore the fact and turn my back
06:13 and not address that that these crafts
06:17 are real that they exist
06:18 there's frankly just overwhelming
06:20 evidence and my background being a no
06:23 kidding investigator throughout my
06:25 career and intelligence officer we have
06:27 a responsibility to report and it's also
06:31 a duty to warn and so when you go to the
06:35 airport right or you go to a train
06:37 station you hear that a famous
06:39 announcement you see something say
06:41 something
06:41 reported when in doubt see something
06:43 suspicious I mean when it comes to these
06:47 things it's the opposite approach until
06:50 recently it was don't report these
06:52 things because you might with your
06:53 clearance you might you might wind up
06:55 being taking a flight status and may put
06:57 you some sort of psychological
06:58 evaluation and it's detrimental to your
07:01 career and so I found that very
07:03 dangerous because the only thing more
07:05 dangerous or something flying in our
07:07 skies we don't know what it is there's
07:08 nothing we can do about it it's not even
07:10 being able to have a conversation that
07:13 is to me unacceptable and so my decision
07:16 to leave the department was in part
07:18 because of my loyalty to the part about
07:20 disloyalty understand that at the time
07:22 secretary Madison this is a man that I
07:25 served in a combat theater with and I
07:27 have the utmost greatest respect to this
07:29 man I've seen him literally make
07:31 decisions that save people's lives right
07:33 there on the spot so so this is a man
07:35 through my experience who should have
07:37 more information about less and when
07:39 he's in a position of Secretary of
07:40 Defense not even being able to let him
07:43 know look these things are in our
07:45 controlled airspace and they're coming
07:47 close to our to our pilots and to the
07:49 point where you almost have a mid-air
07:50 collision that's a problem and simply
07:53 because of stigma and taboo frankly I
07:56 don't give it a food what the stigma and
07:59 taboo is you've got to tell the boss and
08:01 when the bureaucracy doesn't allow that
08:04 to happen then I think there's a failure
08:07 of the system and we have to we have to
08:09 fix that failure and so in fact going
08:11 back to your question leaving what made
08:13 me leave the department it wasn't
08:15 necessarily a single event it was a
08:17 constant frustration of reporting and
08:19 briefing senior DoD leadership on these
08:22 things and this resistance sale okay we
08:24 know who these things are real you're
08:26 right is compelling we've got the pilots
08:27 testimony we got it we're not quite sure
08:30 we want to tell the boss yet that to me
08:33 and by the way I'm not blaming it
08:35 because you know how did you tell a guy
08:36 by the way who's made bad dog managed
08:39 that there's something I Scott I don't
08:41 know what it is we don't know how to
08:42 stop it
08:43 keeping in mind that Department of
08:45 Defense is an organization that is
08:47 designed to have answers and you do not
08:50 want to go to the boss without any type
08:52 of recommended course of action
08:55 again it but at the same time I don't
08:58 think this is like a conversation about
09:00 fine wine and the longer we keep a cork
09:02 on it the better it gets I I think we
09:04 need to have the conversation now in
09:05 fact I think we didn't have the
09:06 conversation five years ago if you ask
09:08 me and so I left the department
09:11 sometimes if you love an organization
09:13 enough if you want to fix it you have to
09:15 leave it and and by the way you know
09:18 reminding that secretary mattis almost a
09:21 year to the day day that I resigned he
09:24 did the same thing he resigned out of
09:26 principle so sometimes you have to leave
09:29 an organization and fix it from the
09:31 outside if you really really love it
09:33 help one of the things I hear quite a
09:36 bit that people are speculating and I'm
09:39 gonna ask you are you currently any type
09:42 of contractor for the government and any
09:44 type of capacity at this time no I don't
09:48 know where they came from I am sure not
09:51 getting paid that's pretty funny
09:54 you know I watched the livestream when t
09:58 TSA launched back in October I guess it
10:01 was docked Oberer 11th 2017 and was
10:04 surprised that there was so little press
10:06 about it then
10:08 December 16th the same year everything
10:10 changed when the New York Times article
10:13 co-authored by Helen Cooper Ralf
10:15 Blumenthal and Leslie Kane was published
10:18 what was that like for you when that
10:20 happened oh gosh
10:21 you know be honest with you I'm a
10:23 creature of the shadows I've spent my
10:25 entire life living in the shadows out of
10:28 frankly that's a matter of art our job
10:30 so it is not my nature to be in the
10:33 middle of the spotlight personally it's
10:36 it's rather uncomfortable for me but at
10:40 the same time I think the message is
10:42 very important and so I'm doing what
10:45 what I feel is necessary now if you want
10:48 a very poor analogy I've often told
10:51 people you know I think of myself as
10:54 this albino caves new living somewhere
10:57 in the recess of some back cave dark and
10:59 happy and you know and all of a sudden
11:01 someone taking this little this little
11:03 lizard that's been happy its whole life
11:06 living the dark and ripping it out and
11:07 putting it in the middle
11:08 Hot Desert Sun on noon on a noon around
11:11 12 o'clock in the afternoon and people
11:13 start poking at it it's it's not my my
11:17 my natural environment but at the same
11:21 time I think I think the message is
11:24 important enough that we have a
11:26 collective conversation with the
11:27 American people well right after that
11:29 came out I interviewed longtime UFO
11:31 researchers Stanton Friedman who we
11:34 sadly recently lost and he said that his
11:39 biggest question is why now is the
11:41 government letting this out can you
11:43 address that well I can't answer on
11:46 behalf of the government because I'm no
11:47 longer employed by the government but my
11:49 question B would be in return well how
11:51 come not five years ago how come not 10 11:53 years ago with and I can't answer that I
11:55 don't know why it may very well be that
11:59 we now are the point where enough people
12:04 are seeing these things and maybe maybe
12:07 it's a cultural thing I really don't
12:08 know maybe it's maybe looking at a point
12:10 where were as a culture we are more
12:12 willing to accept the fact that there
12:15 were things still in nature that we
12:17 don't understand I mean let's look at it
12:18 this way you know up until recently
12:21 there was a statement by some folks
12:23 saying I know we've discovered every
12:25 species that there is to discover and of
12:27 course every year we find new more
12:28 species up until recently we had defined
12:32 a living organism as something that kind
12:34 of looks like you know an animal if you
12:37 will in breach and reproduces and yet we
12:40 find that life is diverse it's plentiful
12:43 that's if you can go to the deepest
12:45 darkest part of the Marianas Trench
12:46 seven miles down and find life a mile
12:49 under the Antarctic ice and you can find
12:51 life and go to a two location on earth
12:54 where these extremophiles exist and we
12:57 look at this and say how can a creature
12:59 live in total darkness and and you know
13:02 many many many degrees Fahrenheit above
13:05 what we can tolerate and live happiness
13:08 in fact thrive so the definition of life
13:11 is something that we continue to look at
13:14 and ask ourselves a question medically
13:15 speaking you could look at a virus and
13:19 say wow is that living thing
13:21 with some cases it says things like the
13:23 living thing every produces and it will
13:26 do other things to survive but in other
13:30 cases you know doesn't have DNA so what
13:33 makes something alive I suspect if you
13:34 were to come to earth and look at a
13:36 plant and look at a human being you
13:39 probably would say wow those are
13:40 completely different life forms and yet
13:43 they are living we have a lot of things
13:46 in common with plants we were produced
13:47 with compete for resources we grow we
13:49 die so I don't know that's that's a
13:53 really good question I don't know why
13:54 now
13:55 you know I don't know what do you think
13:58 about the Navy's new reporting of
14:00 unidentified aircraft do you think this
14:03 forward motion has in part happened
14:07 because of t TSA and your efforts well
14:11 it is undeniably as a result of what T
14:13 TSA engaged in but it's not just a
14:14 retail he's haunted by I don't I don't
14:16 want people to have the misconception
14:17 that they may lose fear driving the
14:19 train and making this happen because
14:20 because it's not as a team effort we
14:21 have folks like Chris melon this is a
14:23 man who who knows more about government
14:26 inner workings and bureaucracy than just
14:27 about anybody else on the planet you
14:29 have folks like like Jim semi Pam senior
14:32 CIA representative who knows about the
14:35 Intelligence Committee probably better
14:36 than anybody and dr. Howard off is a
14:38 scientist world renowned scientist and
14:39 and Steve justice and Tom belongs this
14:43 is a team effort and it's not just you
14:45 know talking to one person and out the
14:47 native changes their mind starts
14:48 allowing their pilots to report this
14:50 stuff this is a coordinated it's a bit
14:54 like a symphony symphony if your role as
14:56 a coordinated effort every instrument as
14:58 their own sheet of music to play has its
15:00 own purpose and has to be in melody if
15:04 you will with the rest of the
15:05 instruments so we are constantly
15:07 coordinating with each other and and
15:09 engaging the certain points within the
15:12 US government that we think need to
15:13 engage in order for them to be educated
15:16 on what's really going on and then with
15:18 that information you allow them to make
15:20 the decision okay yeah you know what
15:21 there are something there maybe we
15:23 should change our policy and by the way
15:26 it's not just with us as a company it's
15:28 also working with our government
15:30 partners we don't want to alienate them
15:31 they're not necessarily the enemy here
15:33 we have to work with them
15:35 and so that's the way to do that is to
15:37 work in a collaborative collaborative
15:39 way where we're recording with them
15:41 making coordinate with us we can
15:42 exchange information back and forth and
15:44 that's how you make change so this
15:49 question in particular comes from a long
15:52 time UFO researcher and he wanted to
15:55 know did you use the resources of anyone
15:58 at NASA that's National Air and Space
16:01 Intelligence Center had wright-patterson
16:04 Air Force Base
16:06 I can't specifically talk about who we
16:09 have or partnering with right now
16:12 keeping in mind some of these
16:13 relationship ships are still in some
16:16 cases they're nascent in another cases
16:17 there's still a little bit sentiment so
16:20 we have to be mindful a lot of times
16:22 when we mentioned specifically who we're
16:24 working with because still it's a
16:27 sensitive topic and some folks still you
16:29 know get a little bit uncomfortable if
16:31 you will I met you down at Cherry Hill
16:34 at the MUFON event and during the
16:36 conference there I believe you said that
16:38 do you think that we're actually going
16:40 through disclosure where do you think
16:42 things are going in the future what's
16:45 your take on that well let me put it
16:48 this way a year and a half ago if we
16:51 were to have this conversation we would
16:53 probably be laughed out of the building
16:56 that we were in if this was a government
16:58 building and if you were to talk to a TV
17:00 TV production studio they would probably
17:04 very quickly dismiss you and be polite
17:08 but they said you know we're not really
17:09 interested in look how far we've come in
17:12 just the last year and a half you have
17:14 now the government admitting that it did
17:16 indeed have a UFO program that it was
17:19 indeed funded the actual academic
17:21 studies were conducted that videos were
17:24 actually collected and obtained and
17:27 analyzed you now have the the admission
17:30 by several elements in the government
17:32 that these things are indeed real and
17:34 now you have changing of policy at a
17:36 national level that allows the reporting
17:39 and the collection of data of these
17:41 things and by the way there's a lot more
17:43 things that occur that it probably can't
17:45 talk about right now but it'll come to
17:46 light so I think we've come light year
17:49 ahead of where we were just a year and a
17:50 half ago and if you look at even the
17:52 show that we're doing now with our with
17:54 the History Channel Ami's History
17:55 Channel
17:55 this isn't a UFO hunting show this isn't
17:58 a an entertainment show
18:00 this isn't even a reality show this is a
18:03 show about reality what they plan is if
18:05 a saw me think a year and a half ago
18:07 they would have assigned some
18:08 entertainment producers to do a show
18:10 like this this is not what they did
18:12 History Channel decided to assign some
18:14 of them was hardened investigative
18:16 journalists that who spent their careers
18:17 looking at the underbelly of the human
18:19 race and things like like sex
18:21 trafficking and and corruption and
18:24 organized crime even a camera crew that
18:27 they assigned to this thing a lot of
18:29 these folks have been in combat theaters
18:32 filming the US troops under fire so this
18:34 is an investigative journalist at peace
18:36 in fact they won't even let me see the
18:38 episodes before the public because they
18:41 want to keep that investigative
18:43 journalist ik integrity and I admire
18:44 them for that so what you're seeing is
18:46 raw footage we you know there are no
18:50 retakes there are no scripts look I'm
18:52 not a Hollywood gun I'm you know I'm
18:53 gonna i'm an old Intel guy you know
18:55 don't you investigators so you could
18:58 even if you wanted me to act I'm not
18:59 gonna be a very good actor so we
19:01 realized very early on that in order for
19:03 this to work it had to be real and what
19:05 the audience see what you see is what
19:07 you get and it's it's that's it and
19:10 we'll let the audience decide for
19:11 themselves I know you said something
19:13 along the lines where you don't know
19:15 what's happening in each episode as
19:18 before it comes out but can you give us
19:20 an idea what we might be expecting down
19:22 the line on unidentified yeah I mean
19:25 because I was I was there obviously for
19:27 the filming I I can't I haven't I have a
19:29 general understanding but I don't really
19:31 know what what they decide to put in and
19:33 what leaves of there was a tremendous
19:34 amount of information contained and I
19:36 think what you'll realize and the
19:38 audience will realize hopefully is that
19:40 this is truly a global phenomena this is
19:42 something that does have a national
19:44 security Nexus and it is a conversation
19:47 that we should have as young people and
19:49 by the way I think they'll also have a
19:51 great appreciation that there are some
19:52 people working behind the scenes very
19:54 very hard and they're doing some
19:56 incredible work and I think our
19:58 servicemen and women in uniform deserve
20:00 the most credit these folks are
20:02 are the best of the best this country
20:04 has and their braids and their Patriots
20:06 and they're doing their duty and they're
20:08 doing it for the first time stepping out
20:10 of the shadows we're a year and a half
20:12 ago frankly they could have lost their
20:14 jobs doing and now you have a navy and a
20:17 PA Oh actually allowing folks to step
20:20 forward and have a conversation on the
20:22 public stage I mean that's that's
20:23 remarkable I mean just a year and a half
20:25 ago imagine how far we've come in just a
20:28 year and a half on this topic
20:30 you now have major media outlets really
20:32 taking this seriously once and for all
20:34 and of course you know going about your
20:36 original question to me that that's
20:38 folks out there that are you know we're
20:40 still trying to push a narrative but
20:42 look how far we've come and I think that
20:45 that's very encouraging and I think I
20:46 think the American people are ready to
20:48 have the conversation why not I thought
20:50 one of the best parts of episode one was
20:53 the female pilot that remained anonymous
20:56 she did look rather shaken do you think
21:01 someone like her will feel more
21:02 comfortable in the future as more of
21:05 this type of thing is validated I hope
21:08 so I know it's I can't answer on her
21:10 behalf I certainly hope so I know for me
21:14 I still sometimes find myself looking
21:16 over my shoulder and and but let me put
21:18 this into context just very recently I
21:20 had a conversation with a colleague of
21:22 mine at the Pentagon he said you know a
21:23 little conversation you and I had to
21:25 have in the shadows behind a vault
21:27 behind a you know a skiff and we'd have
21:30 to whisper I can now have this
21:32 conversation openly and something in the
21:34 halls of the Pentagon and that that
21:36 represents a seismic shift in where this
21:40 conversation is going that people
21:41 actively wanting to help whereas before
21:44 they would run away in the opposite
21:46 direction to say don't ever mention that
21:47 to me again
21:47 now they're saying hey look how can I
21:49 help but what can we do as an
21:51 organization as an agency is a
21:53 institution to help and I think that's
21:56 tremendous are you kidding me I mean in
21:58 a year and a half that conversation has
21:59 come that far Yeah right that's true
22:03 were you initially hesitant when you
22:06 were getting involved with what Tom
22:08 DeLonge was putting together nope nobody
22:11 was I
22:16 look tell you everybody on this team has
22:19 a very special everybody we were a bit
22:23 about our little company's a bit like a
22:24 Swiss Army knife everybody can do a
22:27 particular function very very well in
22:29 Toms case this is a man everybody knows
22:31 him as I guess we'd senior to a couple
22:33 bands but what they don't know is that
22:34 he's brilliant he is truly a extremely
22:39 creative and and quite frankly he's we
22:42 managed to get to the highest levels of
22:43 the government on this topic when nobody
22:46 wanted to have a conversation he's
22:47 tenacious I think as I've said before
22:51 you know sometimes in a crowded room you
22:53 need a megaphone bomb is definitely that
22:55 megaphone is not afraid to about his
22:58 reputation he does what he feels is
22:59 right and I gotta give him credit for
23:00 that
23:01 sometimes I've told you before you want
23:04 to you want to sometimes you need a bull
23:06 in a china shop in Toms case so it's
23:09 more like a fragmentation grenade but
23:11 you know sometimes you need to you need
23:13 to break a little China in order to fix
23:16 a system and he's been very very
23:17 effective at doing that and frankly it's
23:20 just a really decent human being I mean
23:22 I've had a chance in my career to work
23:24 with a lot of people in some good and
23:26 some not so good
23:26 tom is right up there at the top of the
23:29 list he is just a decent human being he
23:32 wants to do the right thing he's willing
23:34 to do whatever he has to do include
23:35 putting his own money his own reputation
23:37 on the line he left he left one of the
23:39 world's largest punk rock bands to
23:41 pursue this because he felt that this is
23:43 the right thing to do I don't know how
23:45 many people out there willing to do that
23:46 a lot of people wouldn't get off of
23:47 their opinions about this but when push
23:50 comes to shove you think they believe
23:52 their job to do it
23:53 no I think they think their careers
23:55 behind to pursue this I don't know you
23:58 know so I think I think I think we need
24:01 to give him credit where credit is due
24:03 he has definitely moved the needle on
24:06 this conversation that's right and you
24:08 know I think there's a lot of jealousy
24:10 because you know Tom came out of nowhere
24:13 basically and people have been on this
24:16 topic some of them for a good part of
24:18 their lives and so there's some jealousy
24:21 out there but you know we really do have
24:23 to give him credit because you know you
24:25 and I wouldn't be even talking today and
24:28 he really has changed a lot look we've
24:31 got to get over this jealousy thing
24:32 there's nothing to be jealous about
24:35 we're trying to have the conversation
24:38 that we've been that some folks have
24:39 been trying to have for a very long time
24:40 this should be cause for celebration
24:43 it's just not time to be Petty and you
24:45 know it's this is a time for all of us
24:47 to work together and say hey you know
24:49 this is an important topic this is
24:51 something that involves humanity that
24:54 was my opinion anyways I don't think
24:56 there's any reason for anybody jealous
24:58 look this is a team effort this is a
24:59 group effort you know how did I had it
25:01 not been for folks having an interest in
25:04 this for the last I guess you know 70 25:06 years maybe we wouldn't have gotten to
25:09 where we are today
25:10 you know everybody everybody should
25:11 accept credit for this this is not a TTS
25:13 a thing or even a History Channel thing
25:16 this isn't you know this is this is a
25:18 this is something that everybody should
25:20 look at and say hey you know I had a
25:22 little part of that you're doing this
25:25 show right now you are doing this
25:26 podcast you have a part of this you are
25:29 very much integral to the conversation I
25:32 mean don't look now but that's exactly
25:34 what you're doing
25:35 you are very as much part as we are you
25:37 are too and so are your listeners
25:39 because they're taking the time to
25:41 listen to this rather than you know
25:42 change the channel to something else you
25:46 know they could be I was and what
25:48 specifically what but there's lots of
25:50 things that people can listen to and
25:51 watch these days and I then tuning in to
25:55 to to your program that should be an
25:57 indicator at that that you are part of
25:59 this this this see change and so we're
26:02 your listeners everybody every one of us
26:04 have a part Lou thanks so much it's been
26:07 an absolute pleasure yes sir thank you
26:09 very much pleasure than bye thank you

27:01 you 

==========VeqkK358hgs==========

00:00 so tell me how you got to know and meet
00:03 an interview Lu Elizondo because of
00:06 sources here in Las Vegas you know all
00:08 UFO roads lead to Las Vegas at one point
00:11 or another I knew there was a guy in the
00:13 position that Lou had I didn't know what
00:15 his name was I didn't know what the name
00:17 of the program was I just knew there was
00:19 a program and I knew there was a guy
00:21 like him that led it in October of 2017 00:25 Lou Elizondo walked out onto a stage in
00:28 Seattle with Tom DeLonge how put off and
00:31 a couple of other folks from to the
00:32 stars Academy and he announced to the
00:34 world that yes he had been in charge of
00:37 this program there was a UFO study and I
00:40 think it was shocking to anyone who was
00:41 watching it it was especially shocking
00:43 to his former colleagues at the Pentagon
00:45 who had no idea that he was going to
00:47 make this announcement for once he made
00:49 that announcement how how did we get to
00:52 the point we were interviewing two days
00:55 after he was on that stage in Seattle
00:58 Lou Elizondo came to Las Vegas and I was
01:00 at a dinner meeting with he and three
01:02 other people and I got to meet him in
01:03 person and get to know him I saw the
01:05 videos that he was going to release a
01:07 couple months later and I knew he was
01:09 onto some pretty big thing so I made a
01:11 point to stay in contact with him in
01:13 December of 2017 the New York Times
01:16 story explodes Lou elizondo's name is
01:19 all over the world and we made a point
01:22 of since the story was out to get him on
01:24 camera is it a threat and if it's a
01:26 threat as a Russian is it Chinese and
01:27 yet these were all normal questions you
01:30 would ask whether you're dealing with
01:31 terrorism or weapons of mass destruction
01:33 or and he issued the shore write
01:34 national security a Shinto sure and yet
01:36 here we are with something that doesn't
01:40 fit doesn't fit doesn't fit and yet no
01:44 you think that from an Intel perspective
01:45 that be exactly where you'd want to put
01:47 it and yet that's the last place anybody
01:49 wanted it to be because it is it wasn't
01:51 well-defined and that is something that
01:53 from a national security perspective the
01:56 government isn't built to respond to to
02:01 two problems in which they're very
02:03 poorly defined you don't know what it is
02:04 you don't know how it works and you damn
02:06 sure can't do anything about it so you
02:09 know it puts us kind of in a weird you
02:11 know catch-twenty
02:12 - yes we need to look at it because we
02:14 don't know how it works but we don't
02:16 have any real recommendations to the
02:18 boss so where does that leave us right I
02:21 don't want to be the guy to go to the
02:23 Secretary of Defense oh by the way the
02:25 guy who's named Mad Dog of all secretary
02:27 defenses until
02:28 mad dog we got a problem we don't know
02:31 how it works we don't know what it is
02:32 and there's nothing we can do about it
02:33 right now that's not a good conversation
02:36 to get in with with the Secretary of
02:38 Defense right and yet that was my job
02:40 and when people above me didn't want to
02:43 allow us to have that conversation with
02:46 the boss who my personal experiences
02:48 here's a man who who likes to operate
02:50 with more information not less right and
02:52 then and you can't even tell him that
02:55 there's a potential problem even though
02:57 we're spending taxpayer money to do it
02:59 then I think that I think there's a
03:02 there's even that in fact to me is more
03:05 of a threat than the threat itself
03:06 that's more of a national security issue
03:08 the fact that we can't tell the boss
03:09 there's a problem more than the problem
03:12 itself and so you know that was really
03:16 one of the fundamental reasons why he
03:18 decided to to leave what I did I'll come
03:20 back that let's talk about the ride for
03:22 you
03:23 you knew there would this was gonna
03:25 create an uproar is it what you expected
03:27 what the reaction the media reaction the
03:30 public reaction oh my goodness you know
03:34 I I'm not sure I knew what to expect at
03:37 all frankly speaking my my intent was to
03:42 leave government service and and maybe
03:44 out of ignorance on my part fade off
03:46 into the sunset you know maybe go work
03:48 at one of the big supermarket chains or
03:50 go drive a truck or something you know
03:52 and and fade off into the sunset I think
03:56 given the topic of what we're talking
03:59 about I think given the fact that it is
04:03 an emotional topic for many many people
04:05 and rightfully so I think people have
04:10 invested a long amount a large amount of
04:12 energy and time and patience and
04:15 resources trying to get to the truth and
04:20 I think when the government finally came
04:23 out of an acknowledged yes
04:25 we had a program and by the way yes we
04:29 still have a program as of three months
04:31 ago i I think it's it's natural for
04:36 people to react the way they did and as
04:39 you're gonna the full spectrum of
04:40 reactions right so on one side you're
04:41 gonna have have some folks that are very
04:43 very excited that this information
04:45 finally came out and that this
04:47 information if the government's being
04:48 truthful and you know disclosure so to
04:51 speak and then you have the other side
04:54 of the spectrum where you know this type
04:56 of acknowledgement in some cases could
04:59 be could be a bit of a hard pill to
05:03 swallow 

==========ssOuR7xI7xk==========

00:00 hey Tom what's up who are you I am good
00:04 how are you I'm good I'm good I feel
00:08 like this is our semiannual quarantine
00:11 check-in cuz the last time I lucky was
00:14 about two months ago that's why I
00:16 thought I was like did we just talk I
00:17 know we kind of did just talk but it's
00:20 always great to see you so what's been
00:23 just going on over the last couple of
00:25 months for you ah
00:27 lots of stuff well the big news was the
00:31 Senate Intelligence are the Select
00:33 Committee on Intelligence released on
00:35 language for basically grabbing all the
00:40 information and again having them be
00:42 accountable up through an interagency
00:44 task force that reports directly to the
00:47 US Senate Intelligence Committee so
00:49 that's a big deal that's something that
00:51 me and my team did at our company to the
00:54 stars and that's you know this is these
00:56 are the steps that you take to get to
00:58 disclosure that's a big big deal I mean
01:01 ticket Riley get Congress briefed and
01:03 acting like national security language I
01:06 mean that's that's a big deal yeah cuz I
01:08 think the last time that you and I
01:10 talked that was just when the Pentagon
01:13 and the DoD had actually confirmed those
01:16 videos that your company to the stars
01:18 put out with the UFOs and so it seems
01:22 like a lot of kind of progress is is
01:24 being made in that direction yeah on
01:27 there is and there's a lot of things
01:30 that are happening in and behind the
01:31 scenes that we can't talk about so I
01:33 think you know as people just it's a big
01:35 deal I mean look there's a lot of people
01:37 that remember like they thought I was
01:42 like I lost mine because I stopped
01:43 playing and blink and like went chasing
01:45 on spaceships but if you look at the
01:47 stuff that came out with the Senate last
01:49 week then you understand why like I'm
01:51 doing what I'm doing and you know but
01:53 you know to the Stars is not a UFO
01:55 research group it's you've got three
01:57 divisions and there's you know there's
01:59 entertainment that's informed science
02:02 fiction that's no different than like
02:05 Disney and the way it operates much
02:08 smaller obviously but on Disney's
02:10 gargantuan that's like saying my band is
02:12 no different than the Beatles you know
02:14 you know but uh but in any case it's a
02:18 lot of people don't understand how it
02:19 works is there someplace that just maybe
02:20 some places are just you know published
02:22 books some people that just make comic
02:24 but whatever we kind of do it all you
02:25 know um you know and then we also have a
02:28 science division and we built an
02:29 artificial intelligence system and
02:31 that's doing a lot of different stuff
02:32 and then we also have an aerospace
02:33 division that has a lot on its plate
02:36 that are you know especially like
02:38 technologies that are you know like
02:41 advanced propulsion and looking at
02:44 different things dealing with how these
02:45 things fly and how to bring it out to
02:47 the world so you know but you know the
02:50 core of a lot of the people in there was
02:52 really about how to exploit disclosure
02:55 because it's coming and that's the
02:57 technology and it's kind of like the
02:59 history of who we are and where we're
03:00 going but it's also how do we tell
03:02 people about it and how do we get people
03:04 to understand because it's it's
03:05 complicated
03:06 you know so but we do a lot of stuff
03:08 there too that has nothing to do with
03:10 you I mean like we're making animations
03:12 and movies about dreams and cool
03:15 you know so we do it that's my update
03:16 sorry absolutely well that's so awesome
03:19 and you know I think I feel like a lot
03:22 of people have sort of come around to
03:24 the idea of other life-forms existing
03:27 that it's probably a very small chance
03:30 that we're the only ones that are here
03:32 and you know I kind of thought like with
03:35 the release of you know or the
03:38 confirmation from the DoD and the
03:40 Pentagon of aliens you know and UFOs
03:42 it's it just seemed like people didn't
03:44 really freak out that much you know no I
03:47 know it's I think we've all been
03:48 prepared we all suspected it I think the
03:50 people are freaked out are the ones that
03:52 stop take a deep breath and kind of
03:54 going okay you know like what's who's
03:57 inside those things or who sent those
03:59 things or what are those things and what
04:01 did you know that's that's that's when
04:04 people tend to have a little bit of a
04:06 gut check because you know that's what
04:08 the government's been afraid of is when
04:09 people will literally digest the fact
04:11 that there are things here that are so
04:14 advanced technologically that there's
04:17 not much we can do about it you know but
04:19 you know but it's gonna let you know
04:22 everything going on in the world right
04:23 now where everything is like feels like
04:26 the
04:26 ellipse and make ants not as bad as
04:28 world war ii imagine world war ii where
04:30 your whole city is getting bombed and
04:31 all i mean i couldn't even imagine so
04:32 right now we're we're dealing with a lot
04:34 of concerts and like movies and stuff
04:36 but so i guess we don't much to complain
04:38 about but i think it feels really bad a
04:40 lot of people lost their jobs a lot of
04:41 people that can't even provide for the
04:42 family getting kicked out of their
04:43 houses and and all or might even dying
04:46 you know because maybe they had you know
04:48 the compromised immune system or
04:49 whatever but i think so a subject like
04:52 this provides an enormous amount of hope
04:54 because it lets us know that we're
04:55 actually all connected that we're all
04:57 related that you know that maybe things
05:00 that have happened in world events that
05:01 have happened that have gotten us to
05:03 this point might not be as they see
05:04 might have been for different reasons
05:06 and I think that'll eventually bring us
05:08 together and identify like how do we
05:10 take ourselves how we take care of our
05:11 planet you know and what are the
05:13 technologies that'll really propel us
05:15 past this this kind of barrier that
05:17 we're stuck against and keep hitting the
05:18 wall pollution and producing too many
05:22 products and you know too materialistic
05:24 and too weirded out with belief systems
05:27 and fighting wars or arguments that
05:29 going on for thousands of years or
05:30 things people just don't know you know
05:32 so I'm kind of thinking that this this
05:36 confirmation is could not come soon
05:39 enough yeah and I like that you kind of
05:42 touched on you know like hope seems like
05:45 kind of a globally shared trauma and
05:50 experience with being not only being in
05:52 the quarantine but I think everything
05:53 that happened with both the black lives
05:56 matter movement and just people
05:57 awakening to the actual like social
06:00 injustice is that are still happening
06:02 after so long and that you know these
06:05 old paradigms need to be broken and just
06:08 seeing all of the millions of people
06:10 that have come together for peaceful
06:12 protests and the the movements that are
06:14 being made I think for me it's you know
06:16 it can be overwhelming and a little bit
06:18 heavy but also it's giving me a lot of
06:21 hope because I think there are so many
06:22 people out there who just want to help
06:24 and do good well I also I think people
06:28 need to look at right now it's like
06:30 having a toddler that there is a temper
06:31 tantrum you know like that parent tends
06:33 to go oh I'm stronger and bigger and I'm
06:35 gonna grab you by the arm and you're
06:36 gonna do what I say and stop screaming
06:38 and target you know but uh
06:40 that's a lot of kind of what's going on
06:43 people are angry and the temper tantrum
06:46 the analogy is like you know there's
06:47 riots and there's anger and there's you
06:49 know this and that and then there's an
06:51 authoritarian parent like you will not
06:53 do this and we will tear gas you you
06:54 know but really I think what it provides
06:56 is the same thing that like you said
06:59 when you have a child and a parent where
07:01 after the whole episode goes down and
07:04 screaming in the yelling and all that
07:05 kind of stuff you can sit down and go
07:07 what did I do that hurt you and what is
07:09 that you want and usually if you're a
07:11 good parent you have that conversation
07:13 and you and you evolve you know so I'm
07:16 hopeful that you know and by the way I
07:19 should throw this out here like this
07:20 isn't like I'm not saying that
07:22 racism is a temper tantrum I just
07:25 realized that when celebrities say
07:26 anything not that I'm a summary sorry
07:29 that's even a bad word but whenever
07:30 people don't very piney but in any case
07:36 it's that's not that wasn't my point my
07:38 point was when people can't take it
07:40 anymore and they have to emote on and
07:44 it's no different than a military and
07:46 kind of version came in with the police
07:48 and everything but my hope is that just
07:51 like a parent and a child where child
07:54 feels controlled and manipulated
07:56 whatever but you know the parent
08:00 government can evolve you know a
08:01 generation beyond us can evolve you know
08:03 because the younger generation they
08:04 won't stand for it anymore and that's
08:06 where the change comes you know in the
08:07 60s is the same thing and you know it's
08:10 exciting to have change that pulls
08:12 people together we all want it so bad
08:14 some people don't but hopefully we'll be
08:16 kicking them by the ass huh out of town
08:19 you know we're done we're done we're all
08:23 I ever once so done with hate and racism
08:25 and war and poverty and I said we're
08:28 done you know I'm like I want to move to
08:30 Denmark I keep talking about every day
08:33 like I was watching this show on Denmark
08:35 and his moms were like we don't like
08:37 worry that there's gonna be a shootout
08:38 at our kids school we don't worry that
08:41 some rapist is gonna come steal our kid
08:42 off the street when we lose a job we
08:45 don't worry because our government takes
08:46 super good care of us if we lose a job
08:48 and they help us find another one we
08:50 don't worry about health because
08:51 everyone gets health care for free you
08:53 know
08:53 you know so there's only and we have
08:55 bike paths we ride bicycles everywhere
08:56 it sounds so nice yeah completely
09:01 different way of living that absolutely
09:04 makes sense and we have an example right
09:06 there be nice if we you know could fall
09:09 maybe make some changes you know just
09:12 hey I'm just pointing out Denmark that's
09:14 all I'm doing I have no idea what if
09:16 it's like the worst place ever I don't
09:17 know anything bad about maybe the food
09:19 sucks it's like you got it don't talk
09:24 I'm sure I've been to Copenhagen right
09:26 isn't that the main place I've been
09:27 there before I can't tell you that I
09:29 remember they all blur together to me
09:31 like that whole Scandinavia region don't
09:33 really know well I definitely feel like
09:36 all that's left is love you couldn't
09:39 have put it out at a more perfect time
09:41 came out a couple months ago you just
09:43 put out the official video for it and I
09:46 want to be kind of cheesy because you
09:48 put this quote at the beginning of the
09:50 video and it's a quick it says we never
09:53 appreciate the connection we have with
09:55 others until it's gone and although we
09:57 may not be able to change the first part
09:59 of the story we can for sure change the
10:02 UH the ending and I just think that that
10:04 is such a cool quote and I was just
10:06 wondering like what kind of inspired
10:08 that or if you just want to kind of
10:10 expand on that a little bit well I think
10:13 you know the the what people need to
10:15 realize is that you know these events
10:19 that happen are not the definition of
10:20 who we are where we're going and where
10:22 we end up you know every time something
10:23 bad happens you know I'm a choice to
10:25 either wallow in that crisis or you use
10:28 it as an opportunity to evolve
10:29 spiritually and um the whole thing
10:33 that's happening right now I think
10:34 people really are evolving spiritually
10:35 in their own way in a lot of different
10:36 ways you know for some people it's like
10:38 man maybe I was working too much and
10:39 wasn't with my family other people might
10:41 be like wasn't going on walks enough
10:42 that's all you do it like walks the
10:43 nature and whatever it might be
10:46 um I think that the opportunity here is
10:48 for us to is to look why everything bad
10:51 that's happened in my life every single
10:54 thing no matter how horrible it was led
10:57 to something good as a lesson everything
11:01 and yeah and I think anybody can look
11:02 back like you had the best job in the
11:03 world and then you got laid off and you
11:06 lost your apartment you
11:07 like everything went south you like like
11:10 worst time ever but if but what it will
11:13 do for you that moment of clarity is
11:15 you'll probably look back oh yeah but
11:17 then I got like this weird consulting
11:19 gig doing you know makeup and now I'm
11:21 doing makeup on movies and it's like the
11:23 best thing ever I don't know how I you
11:24 know I can choose my own schedule you
11:25 know so everything will will lead to
11:28 something else that's better no matter
11:30 how bad it is and I think that people
11:33 get lost in that this is the problem
11:35 with us as people like losing touch with
11:39 who we are as human beings not like this
11:43 is the thing like people are very kind
11:45 of focused on our life like I'm on I got
11:48 a job I'm in the freeway on traffic and
11:50 I go to the movies I go to concerts on
11:52 weekends or whatever on but that's not
11:55 who we are and why we're here you know
11:57 there's there is a unified consciousness
11:59 we don't know much about it they've
12:01 proven it exists because they even use
12:03 these tools in the US government when
12:05 they have psychics that are meditating
12:06 and they can pull out information past
12:08 present future there is a unified mind
12:10 and everyone's connected to it so you
12:12 got to stop thinking that your mind
12:14 exists in that in your head your this is
12:16 just a receiver yeah I think so
12:20 important for me personally especially
12:23 during this time because it's like you
12:25 said everything externally that we
12:27 thought made us us was taken away so
12:30 then we're just left with like Who am I
12:32 how do I feel about myself what am I
12:34 putting out into the world what do I
12:35 want to do with my future you know and I
12:37 know for me like I get anxiety a lot so
12:40 meditation has been something that you
12:42 know has always just really helped me
12:44 and I just always feel more calm and in
12:46 tune whenever I'm doing that so I'm
12:48 really happy to hear you talking about
12:50 that you know and just putting that out
12:52 in the world that's why I always love
12:53 talking to you
12:54 you just you keep it real you know well
12:57 well I know it's funny it's like a
12:59 meditation calming down anxiety and all
13:01 these different things is so on point
13:03 people don't understand that
13:05 consciousness you know it can manipulate
13:08 an effect matter so when you meditate
13:10 you can calm all your emotions down you
13:13 can calm your heartbeat down you can get
13:15 rid of the anxiety you can do a lot of
13:17 different things but it but it just to
13:20 give you another
13:20 what the same meditation does there was
13:23 a physicist working on the UFO program
13:28 at the department defense and when early
13:30 on decades ago when they're looking into
13:32 all the antigravity stuff what they
13:36 didn't understand was their original
13:38 early calculations was that it took an
13:41 enormous amount of power to cancel
13:42 gravity I mean like taking this power of
13:44 the stunt the Sun or something you know
13:46 whatever it might have been might not be
13:48 the case now but just back then but then
13:50 they had these guys that were meditating
13:51 in the Middle East that were levitating
13:53 with no engine no spaceship you know
13:56 like literally just their mind so
13:58 they're like how does consciousness
14:00 affect matter because all we know is we
14:02 have to build an engine and has to be
14:04 antimatter a nuclear power and we got to
14:06 do these crazy frequencies and we got
14:08 our you know but then there's this guy
14:09 that's just meditating and it does it so
14:12 the point is it's a consciousness thing
14:14 you know it's there's something there
14:16 that on that can do the same thing that
14:21 we think we need the power of a star or
14:23 something to do but that just goes along
14:25 with the fact that um you know
14:27 meditation can control physical matter
14:30 can control the matter of your body
14:32 because you are not your body you know
14:34 like you're you're a soul that's
14:36 connected to something much bigger
14:39 you're in this physical to learn and to
14:42 weave and to bump into people so you
14:45 know we have that's my speech we have so
14:47 much more power than we give ourselves
14:49 credit for you know with what we're able
14:51 to pull our minds and and I do want to
14:54 you know talk to you about the Angels
14:57 and Airwaves album which I know you've
14:59 been working hard I saw maybe an
15:03 Instagram story on Ilan's Instagram
15:06 where you guys were kind of doing
15:07 arrangements and finishing touches so
15:09 what's what's up with the new album we
15:13 just started arranging our very last
15:15 song on this week and it and it's like
15:22 basically the way we do things is people
15:25 kind of keep going
15:26 you keep suing you're almost done or
15:27 it's how come it's taken so long well
15:29 what what I do that's different than
15:30 what I used to do we used to like a
15:32 blink we would like I'll write a song
15:33 and acoustic guitar
15:34 then I would sit with mark and we would
15:36 he would learn it and or vice-versa he
15:39 would write something whatever but we
15:40 would kind of figure it out together
15:41 after the fact and then we would go and
15:43 sit with Travis and go what do you think
15:45 and they would change it some more and
15:46 then learn it all together and then the
15:49 third the third step would be going in
15:51 the studio and recording it exactly that
15:53 way that's not how it works anymore
15:56 because recording has changed so much
15:58 over the past couple decades it's like
16:00 now I spend a year like just creating
16:05 and arranging and moving things around
16:07 flipping sound constantly like it's like
16:12 a painting that you're like coming one
16:13 day go I don't like the blue but it's
16:15 really easy to select the blue and move
16:16 it out and put in purple you know so
16:18 it's like what kind of thing and so
16:20 that's the longest process but to get
16:23 down and actually go okay we didn't love
16:25 this this is what we're doing let's
16:26 record it that takes like two weeks you
16:28 know to redo the tracks to where they're
16:30 like the ones you want to keep that
16:32 sound really good because right now we
16:33 don't spend a lot of time just like
16:34 recording a guitar and then we're like
16:36 okay it's good enough it sounds like a
16:38 guitar you know but later we will okay
16:40 now let's crack the tone that we want
16:42 there's a little more time on but in any
16:45 case we're we are within like two and a
16:47 half weeks from starting that tracking
16:50 process so I we are very close you know
16:52 super close and by the way there's
16:56 something that comes with this album
16:59 that I can't say huh that's a really
17:02 that's a really big deal it's it's as
17:06 it's the most ambitious like thing that
17:09 I've done yet so I I'm really excited
17:11 about it like this is what this bands
17:13 for it's like trying to do things that
17:15 people can't don't expect you know and
17:18 and they're like wow wow that's cool
17:20 it's cool you you really put much effort
17:23 into doing something that that has you
17:25 know has something in it that's touching
17:27 so yeah well I think you give your fans
17:30 a really like an experience and you know
17:33 just it's it's um I think it's a way to
17:36 like be able to people that is to go be
17:38 a bad experience over time
17:40 absolutely so are do you think you're
17:42 gonna be dropping a new single
17:44 I'm soon as well yes but um probably
17:49 it'll be like um it's a few months away
17:53 because we're gonna finish this all up
17:55 and then start mixing so we're we July
17:57 August we'll be mixing in August
17:59 September so I could see the new thing
18:01 coming by October maybe maybe I'll see
18:06 me but it's gonna be in that zone yeah
18:08 also just want to touch on season 2 of
18:12 unidentified which is coming out July
18:15 11th yeah so the first season so for
18:19 people that don't know I have a show on
18:21 the History Channel that follows of all
18:24 of my partners at my company to the
18:25 stars Academy and all the kind of
18:28 government work that we do and there's
18:30 so we focus on first season was a lot
18:32 about like who we are how we came
18:34 together and then getting the briefings
18:37 for the first time in like seven years
18:38 over to the houses of Congress and and
18:41 then also being brought in to certain
18:44 governments like Italy and them talking
18:49 about their UFO issues and programs I
18:51 mean so the first season is pretty
18:52 kick-ass the second season rather than
18:55 focusing on just like one or two
18:57 incidents there's like 30 and we had so
19:00 many people from the government come
19:01 forward on over decades of things that
19:04 have happened I mean I I it's it's like
19:08 quantum leap on as well as incorporating
19:12 the recent events with the Senate so I
19:13 think what people are hoping to get out
19:16 of this show on the second season it's
19:19 we're gonna surpass those expectations
19:20 so I'm really excited yeah yeah I'm
19:23 excited to watch it's such a great show
19:24 it's so well done oh the new seasons
19:30 coming out so it's coming yeah in the
19:32 next couple weeks I forgot the date they
19:34 called me here yeah that's like soon and
19:40 then I wanted to ask you we're
19:42 celebrating 100 years of radio so how
19:45 has radio impacted your life in your
19:48 career I remember early on where I was
19:52 staring at this radio listening to it
19:54 listen to the DJ's in the music and I
19:56 heard I literally
19:58 heard blink-182 type sound coming from
20:02 the radio like the guitar riffs and the
20:05 fast pace and melodies and I'm that's
20:08 how I came up with the sound of Blink
20:12 was by listening to the radio and then
20:14 somehow
20:16 Izone out and go wouldn't it be called
20:18 this type of sound was coming from the
20:21 radio not weird it's not weird that's
20:23 amazing yeah natural supernatural stuff
20:28 you wouldn't get it it's really hard for
20:30 people to get it but it really just it
20:33 shows the power of radio and you know I
20:37 think people worry about it is that
20:38 we're all experiencing the same sounds
20:41 at the same time you know yeah it's just
20:44 it's a community together you know well
20:48 used to say that on the last angels tour
20:50 I said that every night before once one
20:52 specific song because there really was
20:54 this scientific experiment where they
20:56 found out that everyone that listens to
20:58 the same music at a concert your brains
20:59 map up together yes with the artists you
21:03 know and I I thought that was really
21:05 interesting and I and that happens
21:07 whether your radio or at a concert or at
21:09 a baseball game you know when everyone
21:11 that's the idea of a ritual that's why
21:13 so many religious you know leaders in
21:16 the Adolf Hitler and so many people you
21:19 would mass consciousness it's a big deal
21:21 you know so the question is is what do
21:23 you want the masses to focus on loves or
21:25 something else you know so uh so
21:28 hopefully uh you know we learned this
21:30 and we use it to our advantage I mean it
21:32 goes all the way back to Native
21:34 Americans doing rain dancing you know
21:35 and they somehow it worked well why did
21:37 it work because groups of people that
21:39 meditate or focus or map up with each
21:41 other
21:42 can can literally influence the weather
21:45 people's emotion they can move objects
21:48 with their minds they can do all
21:49 different types of things they can
21:51 levitate when meditating like I told you
21:53 earlier like that's just the way
21:54 consciousness works it's not a vacuum
21:56 it's a fabric and the fabric connects
21:59 everything so people need to know that
22:01 I'm trying to tell people they won't

22:05 street they won't listen to me I stop us
22:07 and look I got to tell you about this
22:09 meditating and imitating guy I'm
22:12 dating levitating levitating well you
22:16 are just you're on the level I oh I love
22:19 talking to you because you know it just
22:21 gets real and it's it's cool to be able
22:23 to talk about this stuff and put it out

00:13 [Music]
00:15 hi and welcome to PostScript nice to
00:18 have you with us today I'm John Peterson
00:20 from the Arlington Institute and we get
00:23 together like this about once a month
00:25 and it's usually associated with our
00:27 program that we do locally call
00:31 transition talks the Arlington Institute
00:34 for almost 30 years now has sponsored a
00:36 speaker series where we bring marvelous
00:41 provocative interesting speakers from
00:44 all over the world to come and talk
00:46 about the extraordinary change that's
00:48 going on in the world today we're in the
00:51 middle of annek an amazing kind of
00:53 transition from one ERA to a new one and
00:56 the new world is going to be populated
01:02 by new humans that operate in different
01:05 ways and have different characteristics
01:06 and the new world is going to have a
01:10 whole new set of values and other such
01:12 things it's a literally a paradigm shift
01:15 and so we're happy to have our old
01:20 friend dr. Harold put off with us here
01:23 today how it's nice to have you with us
01:25 thanks I'm good to be your you and I go
01:30 back quite a ways yes many hours many
01:36 towns other play all around the world
01:39 kind of doing on one thing or another
01:42 for our for our viewers you're a quantum
01:47 physicist by education beauty and I
01:53 guess you're best known for being in
01:57 their early seventies starting the
01:59 remote-viewing program at SR I which was
02:03 that Stanford Research Institute I'm and
02:06 were use psychics to essentially for
02:12 those governments to spy on us for the
02:15 CIA and yeah yeah yeah tell us quickly
02:18 about that and then we'll talk about
02:20 some other kind of things
02:21 well I was a straight physicist got my
02:25 PhD at Stanford had just published
02:30 quantum electronics book graduate level
02:33 published in English French and Russian
02:35 and one of the things that kind of
02:38 bugged me was well what about
02:40 consciousness is that can you account
02:43 for that in our physics and so on so I
02:45 was kind of searching around for ways to
02:47 look into that kind of thing
02:49 and so just on a lark I didn't
02:52 experiment with a famous psychic who
02:55 perturbed some well-shielded quantum
02:58 chips and yeah Ingo Swann yeah and I
03:01 circulated that around and so suddenly
03:03 the CIA landed on my doorstep and said
03:06 oh we've been looking for you you know
03:09 the Russians and East Bloc countries are
03:11 spending millions of dollars a year on
03:13 quote ESP and no scientists in America
03:16 even believes there is such they had and
03:19 turns out I am I my my background aside
03:23 from my physics has been an intelligence
03:26 community I was a naval intelligence
03:28 officer spent several years at NSA
03:31 National Security Agency so he lived
03:34 into my background asked me since he's
03:36 so I had all the clearances and
03:38 everything well since you're willing to
03:40 do this experiment kind of on a lark
03:42 would you be willing to look at this
03:43 field for us of course their idea was
03:45 you know I'm hoping you'll find it's all
03:48 nonsense but anyway they grew into a 23 03:54 year program working for many parts of
03:57 the government top secret programs and
03:59 so on and training army intelligence
04:02 officers and yeah that kind of thing but
04:05 at some point I wanted to get back to my
04:06 physics so I had accepted a position to
04:12 be director of these two Advanced
04:13 Studies in Austin and took it thinking
04:16 okay well that's the end of my work with
04:18 the government and that's good there's
04:22 only a few years later and the
04:24 government I was looking into how to
04:27 deal with the UFO problem as you would
04:30 say mm-hmm we say UAP unidentified
04:33 aerial phenomena and so I'm gonna look
04:37 into something weird like that who you
04:39 gonna call right well so I got involved
04:44 in that program that's what I'll be
04:45 speaking to your audience today about
04:47 yeah when we're really looking forward
04:49 to that and you and I have always had
04:52 this ongoing conversation for a better
04:55 part of thirty years almost know about
04:58 whether there was life somewhere else
05:00 and how it all worked and we've been
05:02 involved in a couple interesting little
05:04 projects where we tried to anticipate
05:06 what kind of the disclosure or if alien
05:10 life showed up you know how how what
05:12 would the implications be how it had
05:14 changed the world and so on it yeah
05:16 those are some of the most interesting
05:18 sort of projects yeah are involved in
05:21 now but now you're involved in something
05:25 that from my point of view is really
05:28 quite profound for years for decades it
05:33 was kind of known and presumed that
05:36 there was some kind of interaction with
05:40 UFOs you AP's this alien life I mean
05:44 there's reports thousands if not
05:46 millions of reports all over the world
05:48 for years and years that something was
05:50 going on and systematically over time
05:53 then different other countries started
05:55 to declassify their reports and their
06:00 their history and these kinds of things
06:02 but the United States always was the
06:04 kind of doled out you know and and so
06:08 you had all this other stuff going on
06:10 and the u.s. always said oh well no we
06:13 don't have anything about any of that
06:14 and there's a truth the matter is in the
06:18 deep background there was a continuous
06:20 study yeah from the 40s onward and but
06:25 most of it we thought we'd never see the
06:26 light of day and then suddenly December
06:29 2017 New York Times had a front-page
06:32 story on having dug out the existence of
06:36 this program and so up till then the
06:39 media sort of treated
06:40 this was sort of a tinfoil hat crowd
06:42 thing our Friday afternoon if you didn't
06:45 have any other news or whatever but now
06:47 suddenly you have people coming forward
06:49 like senators and pilots from f-18 jets
06:53 carriers and people in the intelligence
06:58 and government communities starting to
06:59 come forth so that was really sort of a
07:03 gate gate changer game changer well as
07:07 I've told you I think it's kind of the
07:10 watershed then when you and some of your
07:12 associates and friends who were involved
07:15 in some of these programs and came
07:17 forward and all stood on the stage I
07:20 mean really class act serious kind of
07:23 people and said this is very real and we
07:26 ought to do something about it and we've
07:27 got hundreds of case studies and videos
07:30 and all kinds of things and suddenly it
07:32 became the defect of the United States
07:35 has been decided that that that they're
07:41 going to come out or or begin the
07:44 process of disclosure I guess that's
07:46 right recently the number of videos of
07:49 taken by f-18 pilots have been released
07:52 and so took a bit a time but finally the
07:57 Navy came out and announced that in fact
08:00 these are not faith or whatever these
08:02 are real things and we don't understand
08:04 what they are and so they admitted for
08:07 the first time actually first time the
08:09 government to say yes we have evidence
08:11 of unidentified aerial phenomena that we
08:13 simply can't identify and we know it's
08:16 important and so finally they actually
08:19 issued orders for pilots f-18 pilots
08:23 typically off of carriers and so on to
08:26 report their sightings it turns out
08:28 sightings men have been going on for
08:29 well over decades but the pilots didn't
08:34 want to report them because yeah they're
08:36 gonna think I'm drunker Sobers okay and
08:39 I'll lose my flight status now the Navy
08:42 has issued a requirement that pilots
08:46 must report any sightings because
08:48 they've had some
08:50 encounters where it involve possible
08:53 safety concerns yeah flying right
08:56 between a couple of jets that are on a
08:57 mission and suddenly something comes
09:00 through and so so it's it's it's a new
09:03 era with in the government's view and
09:05 the military's view toward at least
09:09 admitting something's going on yeah what
09:11 do you think is going on actually I'm
09:14 not sure we have lots of data lots of it
09:18 unexplained good data to work with good
09:22 pilot reports but generally speaking
09:26 exactly what's going on let's go back a
09:33 little bit in you know historically
09:35 there's some kind of iconic events that
09:38 everybody knows about Roswell and so on
09:41 where these craft crashed
09:44 what do you think about that I mean is
09:47 that all real or not or what well I
09:50 don't specifically know about Roswell
09:52 because my involvement has been looking
09:54 at at recent data there may have been
09:58 some crashes oh my god there are claims
10:10 and people coming forward with pieces of
10:13 material right and they came claim came
10:17 from crashes yeah yeah so we're at least
10:20 taking it seriously enough to examine
10:22 material like that that it provided to
10:24 us see if there's anything we can learn
10:27 from it yeah do you have any sense for
10:30 instance from your background weather
10:32 why are they coming or where these
10:36 vehicles are coming from yeah I'm being
10:39 as a scientist and it's my role to do
10:42 this I'm being very careful to not try
10:44 to speculate
10:45 so in fact I've got a whole model called
10:48 the ultra terrestrial model which names
10:51 every possibility of you know what could
10:53 this be other domain
10:55 is it your mother and it's another solar
10:58 systems is there some secret say
11:02 corporate America aerospace yeah yeah or
11:05 some stranded people from elsewhere I
11:09 mean until we actually have the data I'm
11:14 really staying away well an actual my
11:16 colleagues generally are staying away
11:17 from it's a good position as a matter of
11:23 fact you and I have an old friend
11:27 Jacques belli who has built a very
11:33 compelling and profound kind of career
11:36 around suggesting that these things are
11:40 not at all the kind of the physical
11:43 phenomena that we think of them are or
11:45 at least that's not the origins of what
11:47 it is and so there's all spectrum of
11:50 possibilities here in the and obviously
11:53 there's enough effort to try to convince
11:56 you that it's all physical or manifest
11:58 into this dimension or whatever it turns
12:00 out to be but it could be yeah it could
12:03 be something else entirely that just
12:06 presents itself as its physical so
12:09 they're they're more unknowns and many
12:13 questions to try to answer than there
12:15 are unknowns well we've had people here
12:18 in in the speaker series of transition
12:21 talks to talked about archons and jinn
12:25 and other dimensional kind of entities
12:27 who all can manifest themselves and do
12:30 shape-shifting and come in and so on and
12:33 I've literally sat here across from
12:36 somebody as closely as you a friend of
12:39 mine and had him say well yeah I watched
12:41 this black helicopter that turned into a
12:45 crow and then turned into an hour no I
12:49 mean yeah God what in the world how does
12:51 this all work
12:52 yeah you mentioned John Cole a he's
12:54 first why's this wonderful book called
12:56 wonders in the sky where he traced
13:00 really it was a quality approach all the
13:03 way back to you know thousands of
13:06 years ago and then on up through the
13:08 centuries of these kinds of kinds of
13:11 observations and as part of his
13:14 presentation he and my colleague Eric
13:16 Davis put together a seven layer kind of
13:21 model for what could be happening
13:23 ranging all the way from purely physical
13:26 through interdimensional things up to
13:29 spiritual manifestations so it's when
13:34 when we switch to the concept of
13:36 unidentified aerial phenomenon that
13:38 that's really a good label yeah well
13:43 you're involved now with to the Stars
13:46 Academy and talk to us a little bit
13:48 about what you're trying to do because I
13:50 guess from in Europe you're probably the
13:56 most substantial kind of entity or
14:00 organization that's focused on this area
14:03 and and working in multiple kind of
14:05 dimensions to try to generate more
14:09 awareness about it and under my becoming
14:13 part of founding to the Stars Academy of
14:15 Arts and Science interesting history
14:19 many of us that were working in the
14:22 program that they got revealed by New
14:25 York Times and other people senators
14:27 coming out and talking about it
14:29 nonetheless in the government it's it's
14:31 a tough row to hoe it's not exactly
14:34 career enhancing yeah in charge of the
14:36 UFO issue and so a lot of data that
14:41 could be shared for example the videos
14:43 that are now all over the internet and
14:45 on TV were just languishing in Pentagon
14:50 servers and but they could be
14:54 Declassified and released and so on and
14:57 so a number of us that were involved in
15:00 the program decided you know that there
15:03 should be an open group of people who
15:07 know a lot about what's going on and we
15:11 need to bring what
15:12 be shared out out into the public and
15:14 get a conversation going and so several
15:17 of us got together and formed to the
15:20 stars Academy of Arts and Science
15:23 interestingly enough the fellow who got
15:28 it started was Tom DeLonge of blink-182 15:30 a rock star yeah but it turned out that
15:33 in the background he's always been
15:35 interested in UFOs and ESP and that kind
15:39 of thing and he had a lot of good
15:41 connections into people and aerospace
15:43 corporations in the government and said
15:44 you know there should be an organization
15:46 that the degree we can be discussing
15:49 this in the open seriously you know we
15:51 should do that so he decided to form to
15:54 the stars and so some of the people we
15:56 have associated with with our group are
16:00 for example Lou Elizondo who in fact
16:04 Rand the program in the Pentagon and
16:07 left to come in our he is part of to the
16:11 stars
16:12 we have Kristen Ellen who was a former
16:15 Undersecretary of defense for
16:17 intelligence and so he's part of our
16:20 operation Steve justice yes ran black
16:28 programs with billion dollar budgets for
16:29 Lockheed Martin skunk works he's part of
16:32 our new Jim simav an who
16:36 I knew four years from cia's actually a
16:40 true James Bond kind of guy worked in
16:42 the Director of Operations and so he's
16:45 joined our group and then we pulled
16:48 together some scientists to how to work
16:51 with and so on and so our activities
16:56 have ranged all over the place from
16:58 behind the scenes we do end up talking
17:01 to congressional committees and Senators
17:04 and so on i briefed congressional
17:07 committees twice on yeah on the program
17:09 and then in the science area and
17:14 aerospace area we're trying to raise
17:16 funds to do some some really
17:18 forward-looking look into the best of
17:23 what we know scientifically to try to
17:24 explain how such craft if they're
17:28 physical could operate mm-hmm and and
17:33 then the general science group that says
17:38 you know there are a lot of taboo
17:39 subjects you AP's UFO maybe SETI all
17:45 that psychokinesis whatever these should
17:48 not be throwing babies out with
17:51 bathwater we should we should take a
17:53 good look at them and so and we're
17:55 forming good relationships with
17:58 corporate entities with government
18:00 entities to do serious kind of thing and
18:06 T TSA for example last season had a
18:11 series of episodes on the History
18:15 Channel called unidentified and it
18:19 wasn't your usual UFO Hunters or
18:22 something like that
18:23 instead that was primarily Lou Elizondo
18:26 actually interviewing the f-18 pilots
18:30 interviewing the radar operator
18:31 involved with tracking all this stuff
18:33 and so actually getting facts out
18:36 instead of fiction yeah
18:38 and so that's that that edge an
18:43 educational aspect we think is important
18:46 so it's kind of like educational and
18:48 entertainment and research and you kind
18:53 of evolved across the whole across the
18:56 board yeah and again there are many
19:00 people in the what in the UFO space but
19:03 that there's a substance and there's a
19:07 kind of a critical mass about what
19:10 you've let you go brought together that
19:12 it is really quite encouraging and
19:14 appealing I've suggested to you that I
19:17 believe that a decade from now this
19:23 whole subject matter will have been
19:26 opened up so much and will have turned
19:29 into something quite different than what
19:31 it is right now and potentially even
19:33 ongoing conversations with alien life or
19:36 on extraterrestrial life or whatever and
19:40 and the world will be so different then
19:42 you'll be able to point back and say to
19:45 folks like you and your your associates
19:48 at ETS a that was the watershed that was
19:50 when the window opened right and that
19:53 began to legitimate and one of the
19:57 things that was going to emerge from
19:58 this is that there are other countries
20:02 of course who also have their sighting
20:04 their archives and at least claim to
20:07 have some pieces of craft and that kind
20:10 of thing but they learned early on that
20:13 sharing it with the US government was
20:15 not such a great idea because it
20:16 disappears into a black hole and yeah I
20:18 never learn anything so once we set up
20:21 to the Stars Academy we've gone back and
20:26 made connections with these leaders in
20:29 foreign countries we've talked to
20:33 generals from Brazil and whatever and so
20:36 we've said you know look this is a
20:38 public benefit corporation we're going
20:40 to share data that we
20:42 Payne so if you come up with stuff that
20:44 you think we should be looking at
20:46 whether the videos or interviews with
20:49 your pilot's or pieces of materials that
20:51 seem exotic whatever collaborate with us
20:55 yes and we'll see this sees the light of
20:57 day and so we have many conversations
21:01 going on with people in other countries
21:03 and so that's going to be a big game
21:06 changer movement it's a public benefit
21:08 corporation by the way public benefit
21:11 corporation it's sort of kind of lies
21:16 halfway between just money raising kind
21:21 of thing like crowdfunding or an IP
21:26 corporation or whatever you know it's
21:29 kind of in the middle it's it's a new
21:30 category where people can buy shares
21:35 they're not yet to be traded right on in
21:39 in the market but it's an SEC
21:41 corporation eventually if they if we
21:44 have an IP they'll be able to convert
21:46 their shares and trade them on the
21:48 market but meanwhile it's a big piece of
21:50 the public benefit corporation that
21:53 whatever you're doing you have to show
21:55 that you're benefiting the public
21:56 independent of sharing shares with
21:59 individual so that's why providing
22:02 information with these TV interviews and
22:05 so on is as part of that you know as
22:10 would be natural I guess there's a lot
22:14 of criticism or people that are sniping
22:16 about TTS a-about oh you guys are all
22:19 still the front for the CIA and in in
22:23 things like that and and obviously you
22:27 all have relationships continuing the
22:29 relationships with the government or you
22:31 can't forget what you knew and the and
22:33 the people that you knew but the but
22:39 there's something a lot kind of bigger
22:43 here and by that I mean that the
22:48 government and and potentially
22:52 particularly the people of your
22:54 associates come out of the
22:56 defense in the intelligence community
22:58 and they're already entered toward
23:00 toward threats I mean that is the
23:02 business that's the business it's a
23:04 mindset and so I've listened to any of a
23:06 number of interviews where people were
23:09 all critical of Lou Elizondo who or who
23:12 else a bit saying that all they want to
23:16 do is look at threats entered well
23:18 that's their business that's where they
23:20 came from I mean I've been in that
23:22 business in the past and so I understand
23:25 about it but on the other hand there's
23:28 the whole business of this emergence in
23:31 the of a new era in terms of the
23:34 evolution of humanity that is the that's
23:38 I'm particularly interested in it can
23:41 you talk at all about that and have you
23:43 thought much about that kind of aspect
23:45 of where the species is going and how
23:49 that's opening up to new ideas and a
23:52 larger sense of reality I think I can
23:57 let me start with the the concern that
24:01 the critics have said that were just
24:02 some front for the CIA or whatever
24:04 although many of us come out of
24:06 intelligence and defense came out and so
24:10 on believe me we are not a front for
24:13 them they would just assume that we went
24:16 away because if anything the fact that
24:20 there's so much more discussion and
24:23 conversation and in the public media at
24:25 this that makes problems for them
24:27 because routing and foi a request and so
24:30 on so so no no we're we're a group of
24:34 people who have sort of our thinking as
24:39 you say have been concerned about threat
24:41 in the past that that's just the way it
24:44 is but we think that there's a bigger
24:47 issue here and bigger issue here
24:49 involved and you know if it should
24:51 eventually lead to let's say contact
24:53 with aliens or multi-dimensional
24:55 creatures or you know who knows what I
24:58 mean obviously that's gonna make a big
24:59 difference and so from my own background
25:02 starting out as a really straight arrow
25:04 physicist and then getting drawn into
25:07 the remote viewing program
25:09 the CIA and dia and then finding out oh
25:11 my gosh there are people who just
25:14 sitting in their armchairs at home can
25:18 with a little bit of training a little
25:19 bit of instruction really see events
25:23 elsewhere and so on so that opens up a
25:26 whole new window that yeah there's a lot
25:28 gary already you know what you
25:31 ordinarily think it is and then finally
25:33 getting into the UFO area and seeing the
25:35 complexities there and it's unbelievably
25:37 complex so the main take-home message is
25:42 our usual sort of ordinary view of
25:46 reality is really really a small element
25:48 and I mean there are all kinds of things
25:52 I mean like healing healers and that
25:55 yeah yeah as also fellow the Fetzer
26:00 Institute did we look at some shaman
26:03 healing in China and that kind of theme
26:06 and there's some amazing things going on
26:08 so so I think that each of these are all
26:12 pushes and new directions to say the
26:14 human being is much more right and but
26:17 ordinarily our educational system tells
26:20 us it is and so so they've always been
26:24 in these quote fringe groups that pursue
26:26 these elements but doesn't become part
26:29 of the mainstream but I think now that
26:31 we have many elements coming forth with
26:35 better and better documentation I might
26:39 say for example in the UFO area or the
26:41 UAP area we now have military platforms
26:45 that are so technically exquisite you
26:47 can no longer say well maybe it was just
26:49 the flare oh yeah I know you've got
26:51 great detailed data and in the
26:55 alternative medicine area we now have
26:58 excellent investigations DNA analysis
27:03 and you name it so so they're areas like
27:06 that are showing new new outcomes and of
27:11 course in the remote remote viewing era
27:14 that's so-called area I mean that that's
27:18 just a whole new element of finding out
27:20 that
27:22 sure hoe talent within the human being
27:25 that's I mean we found in the program
27:27 that we did that you know it's a bell
27:30 curve like everywhere everything else
27:31 you got
27:32 virtuosos that went into the scale tone
27:34 deaf people at the other but most
27:36 anybody in the middle can learn to play
27:38 an instrument play a tune well it turns
27:40 out the same thing with it ordinarily
27:43 gets labeled paranormal phenomena that
27:45 it's a bell curve distribution some
27:48 countries like India take it for granted
27:50 yeah
27:51 countries and the Western culture
27:54 basically don't and so that's coming to
27:57 the fore so all these things are
27:59 beginning to knit together and beginning
28:01 to reveal much expanded view of human
28:08 life and even gets to the point where
28:10 for example in remote viewing we did
28:14 some challenges about Investors are so
28:19 great why don't they make money at the
28:21 stock market or Las Vegas or whatever
28:23 and so we did some experiments where we
28:27 use that process to do silver futures
28:28 right 30 days in the market we made two
28:31 hundred sixty thousand dollars right and
28:33 so the fact that you in principle could
28:36 even see into the future and have actual
28:39 documented proof with great statistics
28:41 and money in your pocket right you begin
28:44 to realize well there's a whole aspect
28:46 that people are not absolutely tied to
28:50 the present there's some element okay it
28:54 turns out that fortunately at the same
28:56 time our expansion of ideas and quantum
28:59 physics with quantum entanglement and
29:01 nonlocality and all these kinds of
29:04 things that physicists are very busy
29:06 gathering really good data on but they
29:09 haven't made it into the mainstream
29:10 thinking as to who we are yet and what
29:14 we can do but when all of that gets
29:16 integrated you know we're gonna have a
29:18 whole new picture yeah well what you've
29:20 described quite delightfully is this
29:24 convergence from multiple kind of
29:26 dimensions that is reconfiguring the
29:30 kind of the essential
29:31 nature of who human beings are the
29:33 understanding of who we are and moving
29:36 us from one ERA to another one and in
29:39 that process all the old ideas kind of
29:41 implode or collapse and a whole bunch of
29:43 new ones come up and what you and your
29:47 associates at TTS a are doing is an
29:50 integral part of that an important part
29:53 of that and we're really pleased to have
29:55 you here today and looking forward to
29:57 what you have to say well I'm looking
29:58 forward to the presenting my data yes we
30:01 appreciate your being with us thanks
30:03 Helen well thanks for the invitation I
30:04 appreciate you and thank you for being
30:06 with us we try to do this on a regular
30:11 basis we'll be back about once a month
30:14 and we've got Joanie Petry coming next
30:18 month
30:18 Joanie patria is a world-class
30:21 astrologer quite a force on the internet
30:24 and she's going to come and talk about
30:27 long-term what the astrological kind of
30:31 indicators are for the changes that are
30:34 coming in the next five to seven years
30:36 and so that'll be interesting and we
30:38 hope that you'll come you can find out
30:40 complete information on our program at
30:42 transition talks dot org transition
30:46 talks org and we're located here in
30:50 Berkeley Springs West Virginia just 100 30:53 miles from Washington and Baltimore and
30:55 it's a wonderful little resort town
30:58 where you can come and spend a weekend
31:00 and get provoked intellectually as well
31:03 as getting massaged and all kinds of
31:06 good things for your for your mind and
31:09 your spirit in your body and we hope
31:10 that you'll come and be with us and so
31:12 thanks again I'm John Peterson from the
31:15 Arlington Institute and we thank you for
31:17 coming and beaten with us in post great

00:33 [Music]
00:51 dr. Harrell put off as an old friend of
00:54 mine we go back kind of pretty close to
00:57 30 years we've been wandering around the
01:00 world at different places together and
01:02 sitting for hours on end meanings and I
01:06 mean he and I I remember we were sitting
01:09 on a board together in Las Vegas and 27 01:12 times I went to Las Vegas in three years
01:14 four weekends just to sit around with
01:17 him and a bunch of other wonderful and
01:21 the reason why I think an old friend of
01:23 mine that's because early on when I was
01:25 doing some work with a Department of
01:28 Defense and wandering around knowing
01:30 project for the Secretary of Defense as
01:32 a matter of fact looking at new ways to
01:34 think about the future I ended up in
01:36 some crazy place up in Colorado where
01:44 they were doing a new science convention
01:46 and and it's a whole different story on
01:49 its own but it just blew my mind cuz I
01:51 didn't know what I was getting into and
01:53 it was just crazy UFO things and no
01:57 plants that talk to you and it was weird
02:00 and you know what I'm talking about
02:03 Cleve Backster pathetic
02:06 and in any way I heard about this thing
02:09 by remote viewing and I had and it was
02:13 this deep secret program right that the
02:16 government had to use psychics to spy on
02:19 the Soviets and the Russians and other
02:22 such people and so I had enough
02:25 clearances and stuff and could poke
02:27 around and knew how the system work that
02:28 I hunted up now and I don't remember
02:30 even the details out and all got
02:32 together but anyway we hit it off and
02:35 we've been friends and been involved in
02:38 all things unusual for for a long time
02:42 and the thing of course it brought us
02:44 together in addition to reviewing at the
02:47 beginning was our mutual interest in the
02:50 whole UFOs and alien life and the
02:53 possibility that there was a a lot more
02:55 going on in this part of the galaxy than
02:59 that most people understood the
03:02 importance of that relative to the kinds
03:04 of reasons why we all come together here
03:06 or these dials that you all come
03:08 together here is that we're in this
03:12 middle of this extraordinary transition
03:14 and there is a place 10-15 years from
03:18 now and it's a whole different kind of
03:21 place that operates in a way different
03:23 way and part of the reason of that is
03:26 because almost certainly human beings
03:30 have started to integrate themselves
03:31 into the larger community of
03:36 civilizations that live in this part of
03:39 the galaxy and the reason why that's
03:42 going to happen is because of this man
03:44 and some of his friends because they
03:48 represent the opening to this whole
03:52 disclosure process that about what the
03:56 United States government has been doing
03:57 under the table for a long time of
04:00 course they've been lying to us telling
04:02 us of course that we don't know anything
04:03 about this stuff but they didn't they
04:05 were and what Hal and his friends are
04:08 doing are trying to put that on the
04:11 table and make that part of the
04:12 legitimate conversation that we all have
04:15 and in the process they facilitate this
04:19 emergence and transition of humanity
04:24 he's a quantum physicist and you know
04:27 done a bunch of stuff and he can talk to
04:28 you more about it but it's just
04:30 wonderful to have you with us thank you
04:31 though thank you John well I appreciate
04:41 your interest and the fact that you've
04:43 come here so I'm very anxious to share
04:46 what I had to share and as you'll see
04:49 from my message up here back story and
04:55 forward story there is a back story
04:58 about the government's involvement in
05:00 the UFO or we now call it UAP
05:03 unidentified aerial phenomena program
05:06 but there's also a forward story where
05:09 some of us who've been part of that
05:11 program have banded together to try to
05:15 get more data out for the public to have
05:19 a conversation about so I'm going to
05:21 cover both aspects let me begin with a
05:26 back story anyone who follows the UFO
05:30 area knows that you know starting in
05:33 1947 we supposedly had the Roswell crash
05:35 and whatever and there were a lot of
05:39 people calling the Air Force and saying
05:43 I've seen something in the sky and so on
05:45 and the public pressure was so great
05:47 that project sign was set up ran for 47 05:54 48 to gather data from
05:56 generally the public about what they
05:59 were reporting the seeing and that
06:01 transmogrified into project grudge and
06:04 finally in the Project Blue Book Project
06:06 Blue Book course was the longest-running
06:12 organization ran for 17 years but in
06:15 1969 Condon at University of Colorado I
06:22 was asked to set up a program to
06:24 investigate whether there's anything
06:25 that we should be taking seriously in
06:27 what the Blue Book people had found and
06:30 they came to the inclusion though
06:31 there's nothing here don't worry about
06:35 it
06:36 nothing worth following up on and so
06:39 basically public knowledge about any UFO
06:43 program ended there
06:45 and so if between 1969 and roughly now
06:48 if you send something in to the Air
06:52 Force public affairs office and said
06:53 well what are you learning about UFOs
06:55 what's going on it's oh no no we shut
06:57 that program down in 1969 truth the
07:01 matter however is that the very memo
07:06 that shut down the program written by
07:09 general Bolander had down in the fine
07:12 print of the memo reports of UFOs which
07:17 could affect national security will
07:19 continue to be handled to the standard
07:21 Air Force procedures so the truth of the
07:24 matter is the programs continue and are
07:27 continuing today
07:33 this has been very much under the covers
07:38 separate us is not no media associated
07:42 isn't so on until December 16th 2017 07:48 when suddenly there was a front-page
07:51 story in The New York Times talking
07:55 about a program that had been going on
07:57 called advanced aerospace threat
07:59 identification program and we call it a
08:02 tip and this was an absolutely amazing
08:07 revelation they had good sources I was
08:11 part of the program I thought it would
08:14 never see the light of day and suddenly
08:16 there I am even huns New York Times and
08:22 of course with that kind of coverage
08:25 mainstream press Washington Post CNN so
08:28 on picked up the story and suddenly of
08:31 this big barrage of media publicity the
08:37 thing to realize is that this was a game
08:40 changer the reason was that the kind of
08:44 people who are now coming forward which
08:47 I've listed here X Senate Majority
08:49 Leader Harry Reid who actually founded
08:52 the program top rated f-18 pilots who
08:56 encountering what we call advanced
08:58 aerospace vehicles significant
09:02 Department defense and intelligence
09:04 community officials began to come
09:06 forward because of what had been
09:08 revealed to answer questions and so
09:11 suddenly this whole area via the media
09:16 moved from being just the tinfoil hat
09:19 crowd for news in a Friday afternoon
09:21 when we don't have anything to write
09:23 about there's suddenly oh my god you
09:25 know there's something really going on
09:29 the actual name of the program was
09:31 advanced aerospace weapons systems
09:33 application program all SAP but it went
09:36 by advanced aerospace threat
09:39 identification program a tip so a tip
09:42 was a nickname and later on the actual
09:44 name of the program and how did this get
09:49 started this program began in June of
09:52 2008 the Defense Intelligence Agency was
09:56 concerned about threat from advanced
09:59 aerospace vehicles crafts and drones of
10:03 of unknown origin congressional budget
10:06 was approved to address the issue Senate
10:09 Majority Leader Harry Reid and the
10:12 senator anyway from Hawaii and Senator
10:14 Stevens from Alaska were the people who
10:17 were basically in charge of black-budget
10:19 programs so this was all done behind the
10:22 scenes the rest of Congress didn't know
10:24 the programs being set up so that that's
10:27 how that's how it got started and once
10:33 the news came out in the New York Times
10:35 you might think that while these heavy
10:37 hitters are going to kind of run away
10:38 and walk it back and whatever not at all
10:41 this statement by read I think
10:43 summarizes the view of major political
10:47 players that were involved that is we
10:49 don't know the answers but we have
10:51 plenty of evidence to support the
10:52 questions this is about science and
10:55 national security if America doesn't
10:58 take the lead in answering these
10:59 questions others well well the a tip
11:04 program had two concerns two areas of
11:08 threat that they were concerned about
11:10 the obvious one of course what are these
11:14 things
11:15 craft flying over continental United
11:19 States and we don't know what they are
11:21 possibly offworld possibly some other
11:25 country has got advanced technology what
11:28 is this all about
11:29 now you might think that that would be
11:31 the major threat it turns out that
11:34 wasn't the major threat there
11:36 concerned about majors that they were
11:38 concerned about is future threat what
11:41 happens if a potential terrestrial
11:43 adversary say the Russians are the
11:45 Chinese or whatever achieve some
11:47 significant breakthrough and develop
11:50 game-changing disruptive technologies
11:52 based on their evaluations of the
11:54 phenomena or maybe from sensor data or
11:57 from crash retrieve materials that's
12:00 what they're really worried about of
12:03 course that's what the intelligence
12:04 community and the defense establishment
12:05 have to worry about that's their remit
12:08 and well they should be concerned this
12:12 is a paper or actually it's a giant
12:16 report about that thick that we were
12:19 able to get out of the out of the Soviet
12:21 Union this is all the way back as early
12:24 as 1991 they have had a massive program
12:30 in the black just like we did trying to
12:33 figure out what this is all about and
12:36 this this report has tons of units and
12:41 academic institutes and research
12:43 institutes they were involved in
12:45 assessing various aspects so this was a
12:48 big deal and of course the DIA and
12:51 others in the intelligence community
12:53 understood that that was going on and so
12:56 to give an example which probably most
12:59 of you have seen because it's been in
13:00 the news a lot lately
13:01 the investigations of the Nimitz carrier
13:06 group operating off of San Diego and
13:11 several occasions these advanced
13:14 aerospace vehicles would descend rapidly
13:16 from 60,000 feet 50 feet above the water
13:18 hover and then take off I mean
13:22 absolutely astounding kinds of things
13:26 and one of these times a couple of f-18s
13:29 were a launch from Princeton USS
13:32 Princeton and vectored by overhead AWACS
13:36 planes to investigate and see what was
13:40 this can you get eyes on
13:43 and so in fact they got to where they
13:48 were targeted to see if they could see
13:50 something and sure enough one of the
13:54 f-18 pilots actually got a good view the
13:59 object was hovering kind of over the
14:01 water and he went right down to check it
14:04 out
14:04 and in sunny it took off to the horizon
14:10 in a couple of seconds I mean he was
14:13 absolutely amazed what he described was
14:17 that there was an elongated craft so
14:20 like a tic-tac you know the kind of
14:21 candy you you can eat solid white smooth
14:25 no edges about forty six feet in length
14:28 about the size of his f18 uniformly
14:33 colored no appendages sticking out like
14:36 wings or tails or whatever they were
14:39 stealthy yet day eighteen radars
14:41 couldn't obtain lock but forward-looking
14:45 infrared radar could track while it was
14:50 stationary at lower speeds
14:51 forward-looking infrared radar just
14:53 picks up the heat signature and so even
14:56 though there's no radar lock or whatever
15:00 I mean did have a temperature above that
15:01 or the surrounding volume of space and
15:05 so it would stand out on a flew radar
15:08 and appeared to demonstrate advanced
15:11 acceleration aerodynamic propulsion
15:13 capability zipping around Navy commander
15:17 Dave raver has been on the news and you
15:21 can find interviews of him several in
15:24 fact on the Internet
15:26 he was the first pilot to actually get
15:30 there and see what was there to see and
15:35 of course he had a wingman who also saw
15:38 it and he had another plane who was
15:39 watching from above and there was this
15:43 event occurring he did not have a Fleur
15:47 radar on his particular f-18 so when
15:50 they landed back at the carrier he told
15:53 the next flight of people going out
15:56 you know I saw this thing see if you can
15:59 get out there and get a picture because
16:01 you've got your FLIR radars operational
16:03 and so on the second flight out in fact
16:06 they did capture this picture I have to
16:10 realize this is on infrared video seeing
16:14 a heat signature now if this was some
16:16 kind of propulsion of anything we could
16:18 imagine like hot gases coming out the
16:20 back or whatever you would see that kind
16:23 of a plume and so the big mystery here
16:26 was you just had the craft and it was
16:28 hovering and it's not obvious what is
16:31 propulsion system was you see no
16:33 evidence of it so when they came back
16:36 from their flight then they showed Dave
16:38 flavor this picture he said yeah well
16:40 that's that's basically what it looked
16:41 like when I saw it up relatively close
16:44 range they might think 2004 I mean what
16:47 are you talking about things that
16:48 happened a long time ago it didn't stop
16:51 over the decades
16:53 lots of views of this happening with the
16:57 f-18 pilots more recent times 2015-2016 17:01 you've got the carrier groups USS
17:04 Roosevelt in this case operating off the
17:06 East Coast the United States and they
17:09 see the same things actually interfering
17:12 with their missions there have been
17:16 cases where couple of f-18s are going
17:19 along something disappears or zips
17:22 through it disappears right between them
17:24 and so it actually became an inner
17:26 safety issue and that's part of what led
17:28 to some some additional publicity I
17:34 guess you would say
17:43 [Music]
17:48 Oh
18:10 this is displayed on the web and in
18:12 various TV shows so I'm sure you can
18:16 hunt it down and and learn about it so
18:21 we had Flair displays recorded they're
18:23 detailed debriefs of the pilots for
18:25 example commanded a favor
18:28 he had like 12 planes under his group
18:33 300 people reporting to him he was a top
18:36 commander of this airforce group the key
18:42 assessments were advanced aerospace
18:46 vehicle no known air vehicle an
18:49 inventory of us or for nation low
18:53 observable characteristics stealthy
18:58 advanced performance advanced propulsion
19:04 capability to remain stationary
19:06 transition to horizontal vertical
19:08 velocity is far greater than any known
19:10 aerial vehicle and with no little
19:13 signature so that's what the DIA had to
19:19 contend with so how are we going to
19:23 figure out what's going on so for this
19:25 particular program the latest of many
19:27 programs they put out a broad area
19:31 announcement in 2008 and said we want 12 19:37 potential threat areas to be evaluated
19:39 lift propulsion control human effects
19:44 human interface armament and whatever
19:46 and so a request for proposal went out
19:49 to the defense industry and the
19:51 intelligence community
19:54 and dia chose Bigelow Aerospace as a
19:57 contractor to address the potential
19:59 threat now some critics out there said
20:03 no wait a minute I mean Harry Reid was
20:06 senator from Nevada and Bob Bigelow is
20:10 an aerospace person was located in
20:13 Nevada wasn't this just some kind of
20:14 sweetheart deal the answer is no I mean
20:17 Bigelow had already had a large program
20:20 that he had put his own money into for
20:23 years in fact John and I were a part of
20:26 being on his science advisory board and
20:29 so it's actually the DIA chose Bigelow
20:32 they they felt he would be the person
20:34 who had the right go-get-'em attitude
20:37 and of course had the right kind of
20:41 technical environment behind him so he
20:48 set up a division of Bigelow Aerospace
20:50 called Bigelow Aerospace advanced Space
20:53 Studies we call it bass and of course
20:56 he's supposed to do all the things you'd
20:58 expect someone to do if he set up a
21:01 program like this well I came into the
21:04 picture is that bass contacted me
21:08 contacted my organization and asked me
21:11 to collaborate as a subcontractor since
21:14 with John we had been on this advisory
21:16 science advisory board we had many years
21:19 of collaborating I've been a science
21:21 advisor to Bigelow Aerospace so it be
21:23 natural that you might think of choosing
21:25 me the particular area that I took
21:30 responsibility for is based on this
21:32 there was a critical issue as you can
21:35 well imagine in these deep black
21:37 programs it's difficult for contractors
21:40 to obtain expert opinion on critical
21:42 technologies because there's such high
21:44 level security and there's
21:46 compartmentalization we call it
21:48 stovepiping so you've got people at this
21:51 desk people right next door at that desk
21:55 and they can't talk to each other and so
21:58 I mean this this really held back
21:59 progress so I was given the
22:03 remit to try to break through this kind
22:07 of issue
22:08 and so I was contracted to Commission
22:11 papers from experts around the globe and
22:14 since we didn't want to be in the
22:16 position of going out and saying hey
22:17 we're trying to figure out this UFO
22:19 thing you know can you help us out here
22:21 I mean the publicity associated with
22:23 that in our black program when it would
22:25 have been a disaster so instead I just
22:27 simply went out to people said I'm doing
22:30 a survey where were your particular
22:34 application or your particular interest
22:38 in your particular technologies be in
22:41 the year 2050 and as far as aerospace
22:45 industry went and so if I wanted to know
22:48 well you know what do we know about
22:50 invisibility cloak II I could go to the
22:53 super expert even if he's over in Europe
22:57 someplace not revealing anything and say
23:00 you know can you write us a white paper
23:03 on versus invisibility cloak in
23:05 technology going or whatever so or two
23:10 year period I let out 38 contracts I'm
23:14 going to show you the 38 papers so you
23:17 can judge for yourself how technically
23:20 Hornung oriented this program was as you
23:25 can see I mean some critics out there
23:27 said oh well that program was just
23:29 looking at advanced aerospace vehicles I
23:32 mean in the sense of what are the
23:35 Russians going to do in a few years or
23:37 whatever but of course if you if you
23:40 read between the lines and you see you
23:42 looking at warp drive traversable
23:45 wormholes and stargates I mean we're not
23:48 looking for what the Chinese are going
23:50 to make next year this program was
23:53 absolutely directed toward trying to
23:56 address and solve to the best of our
23:58 ability quote the UFO program problem
24:04 another set of papers we were into
24:09 looking at the forefront area
24:12 everything in case you have any eye any
24:22 resonance with people say whoa no this
24:25 is just looking at ansed aircraft
24:28 production well then how do you explain
24:31 that we had a whole program on
24:33 evaluating the statistical Drake
24:35 equation which is an estimate of how
24:38 many intelligent civilizations are
24:41 they're capable of technological advance
24:44 in our galaxy this is definitely a UFO
24:48 program a UAP program as we call it
24:58 these papers who were collected together
25:00 and put out as a series of Defense
25:03 Intelligence with reference documents
25:06 they were put up on a special server
25:09 called Jay wicks and as you see here
25:13 they were unclassified but for official
25:16 use only subcontractors and defense
25:19 officials intelligence community
25:21 officials they could go all go in and
25:23 read these papers now the DIA often does
25:27 these birds as we call it defense
25:29 intelligence we get reference documents
25:31 typically a series of papers will go up
25:34 for let's say a few couple of months or
25:37 three or four months and then they're
25:38 taken down replaced with something else
25:40 our 38 papers turned out to be the hit
25:44 bonanza years went by and they were
25:49 still on there being looked at every day
25:52 practically so this was really quite a
25:55 hit series because they're very advanced
25:58 technical detailed papers on all kinds
26:03 of things that would be of interest in
26:05 the community so let me give you a
26:11 couple examples we have one here called
26:14 metamaterials for aerospace use I can
26:17 talk about an open-source sample I can't
26:19 talk about others and many of you have
26:22 probably if you've seen various TV
26:26 programs and interviews and so on you
26:28 don't know about this there was a sample
26:31 that was sent anonymously by a military
26:35 source he claimed that his grandfather
26:38 had been involved in a crash retrieval
26:40 operation and had gotten some material
26:43 from it and so he didn't want to
26:46 identify himself but he sent it forward
26:48 for analysis that's what it looked like
26:51 as a multi-layered piece of material and
26:57 Linda Howe is the one who got it and
27:00 began shopping it around
27:02 trying to get analysis of it she's she's
27:05 a really a stalwart person to try to
27:07 find out about this it had layers of
27:11 bismuth the size of that is less than a
27:16 human hair those are the black areas you
27:20 can see through here and then they were
27:23 separated by layers of magnesium which
27:26 are the lighter areas and so that's what
27:29 the sample actually looks like been a
27:32 lot of controversy a lot of discussion
27:34 about this because after all here you
27:38 see something that does look like it was
27:39 in a crash the thin lines with the
27:41 bismuth lines so what do we really know
27:50 about that chain of custody is
27:51 non-existence Providence is questionable
27:54 so for all we know it could be a hoax it
27:59 could be a fraud it could be some slag
28:01 from foundry floors some factory but
28:07 nonetheless it was unusual sample so we
28:11 decided okay well then then we should at
28:15 least take a look at it have an open
28:17 mind early on Linda Howe the researcher
28:23 who had this sample given to her by art
28:26 bell went around to many institutions
28:30 and groups to try to get some analysis
28:35 first of all a survey of academic
28:39 publications interviews with people from
28:45 organizations involved in special
28:47 materials and so on even went to
28:50 archives of the National Labs like Los
28:53 Alamos or wherever and nobody had any
28:56 data on this kind of construction having
29:01 been made and then there was someone
29:04 else she went to and they tried to see
29:06 could they Bob could they just duplicate
29:09 the material in fact they had trouble
29:12 bonding the magnesium and bismuth
29:14 together so it wasn't clear exactly how
29:18 you would make it and then finally and
29:21 talking to materials experts you say
29:22 well let's just say somebody could make
29:25 this what would you use it for and all
29:28 the material scientists said I don't
29:31 have a clue I don't I can't even imagine
29:33 the reason for constructing something
29:36 like this however what happens is a
29:41 couple decades go by or more and
29:44 suddenly we have our whole science of so
29:47 called metamaterials has been coming
29:50 into the fore and developing kinds of
29:52 stuff and lo and behold a paper gets
29:57 published which says you know if you had
30:00 a bismuth layer of just this size that
30:03 happened to match what we had and it was
30:07 separated by magnesium layers of about
30:12 the size that we see this would have a
30:16 very special property this came out of
30:22 metamaterial a with the material so it
30:29 turns out this would make a terror Hertz
30:30 waveguide okay what is what's terahertz
30:33 well you you hear about megahertz and
30:35 gigahertz in the microwave spectrum and
30:38 then you hear about infrared radiation
30:40 well terahertz sort of lies in that
30:42 no-man's land as far as technology
30:44 development goes above microwaves above
30:48 gigahertz but less than the wavelength
30:52 of infrared heat so it turns out that
30:57 ordinarily when you have a waveguide and
31:01 you want to sink it send a signal from
31:03 one place to another you know you have a
31:05 pipe for example and the pipe generally
31:08 has to be about the size of the
31:10 wavelength a half a wavelength for
31:14 example well in this case there's a
31:16 frequency band around five terahertz and
31:20 the wavelength is a certain size
31:26 but turns out in this special kind of
31:28 material those thin bismuth layers would
31:33 transmit those signals at 120th the size
31:38 of the wavelength and so that means you
31:42 now have sub-wavelength waveguide
31:46 effects so what that means is if you
31:49 want to transmit a lot of data it
31:50 terrorists frequencies and usually can
31:52 imagine a stack of wave guys to do it
31:54 with now suddenly you've got this whole
31:56 thing micro-sized down and you can carry
32:01 out your task and it's only because of
32:03 metamaterials being developed now
32:06 there's no mana materials being
32:07 developed back in the days when the
32:10 sample was found and that's for sure but
32:13 anyway so there's a possibility this has
32:16 an important effect so actually what we
32:18 see here then and this happens in many
32:21 cases you get a material sample unusual
32:24 characteristics and you want to evaluate
32:25 it metha manufacture is difficult to
32:29 assess or reproduce as it was here
32:33 purpose of function not readily apparent
32:36 but then our own science advances on
32:39 over the decades and finally we get to a
32:42 place where we can imagine the possible
32:45 purpose or function comes to lie which
32:47 is what was the case here we still have
32:51 this in the pipeline to do a lot of
32:53 experiments on that haven't been done
32:55 yet because we haven't raised the
32:56 funding for it but there's more to be
32:59 done let me pick another one spacetime
33:03 metric engineering this is a mouthful
33:07 this happens to be the area that I
33:09 personally was the leader on the
33:13 question is can you account for what
33:17 we're seeing based on known physics and
33:20 of course all the pilots get back and
33:22 say oh my god I can't believe these
33:23 things and they're violating the laws of
33:25 physics are standing still they're
33:27 taking off instantly like they don't
33:31 have any inertial mass as this you know
33:33 we don't know how that could even be
33:35 possible in principle well that's fine
33:38 for the pundits and the media
33:39 and even the pilots to to say but the
33:42 truth of the matter is we can't account
33:44 for them we can't account for them by
33:47 taking an engineering approach to
33:48 general relativity Einstein's theory of
33:50 general relativity so what does that
33:54 mean
33:54 well all of our electronic devices you
33:56 know this device I'm holding your
33:59 cellphone's the lights whatever you want
34:01 say are all using equation using
34:04 electromagnetism electromagnetism has
34:07 its foundational equations and
34:10 everything that we have is really built
34:13 on the what the equations predict and
34:15 that that's a completely mined area of
34:19 science and technology when it comes to
34:22 general relativity Einstein's theory of
34:24 general relativity that's mostly been in
34:25 the purview of astrophysicists or trying
34:30 to figure out what happens when black
34:31 holes merge or whatever no one ever
34:37 thought of taking the equations of
34:39 general relativity just like we have the
34:42 equations for electromagnetism Maxwell's
34:44 equations and say well suppose we could
34:46 engineer those equations suppose we
34:49 could build something based on those
34:50 equation this is textbook physics we're
34:52 talking about not not French physics so
34:56 one of my jobs was then to make a list
34:58 of all the weird anomalies reported
35:01 about these objects actually from my
35:04 standpoint the weirder the better
35:06 because if somebody is making up
35:08 something and it's fraudulent and the
35:10 hoax they're gonna try to say something
35:12 that's you know kind of could sell make
35:16 sense when somebody comes up says well
35:19 you know I was outside the craft and
35:21 it's only that big but when I got inside
35:23 it was a football field in size I mean
35:25 oh you know so we list all the weird
35:28 aspects that have been reported and list
35:31 all what would be the weird things you
35:34 would find if you could engineer general
35:36 relativity equations and they matched up
35:38 hand and glove I'll give you some
35:42 examples for example warp drive how
35:46 about zipping across the universe and
35:48 you always hear we you can't do
35:50 it's uh you know he can't beat the speed
35:52 of light and so on well that whole thing
35:54 about not beating the speed of light has
35:56 to do with Einstein's special theory
35:57 relativity but it turns out that in
36:00 general theory of relativity there's a
36:02 way to do that here's a very famous
36:06 astrophysicist by the name of Alcubierre
36:10 he was a Star Trek fan and so he said
36:14 you know I wonder if I could find
36:16 solutions and general relativity that
36:19 would let me make warp drive and I have
36:23 a lot of constraints on that you know I
36:25 want to leave it breakfast time I have
36:28 breakfast time at home go to Alpha
36:30 Centauri for lunch come back and have
36:33 dinner with my family and I want them
36:35 still to be the same age I am and on the
36:38 trip I don't want to be turned into
36:40 sauce on the back of the spaceship with
36:42 giant accelerations in fact I'd like to
36:46 just be feel like normal kind of things
36:48 and so we worked through that solution
36:50 and developed what's now called the
36:53 Alcubierre warp drive he published this
36:55 at an absolutely Tier one physics
37:00 journal that deals with general
37:03 relativity and so it was very sort of
37:08 famous picture of what his warp drive
37:13 solution look like where you sort of
37:16 depress space-time metric as we call it
37:20 in front of the ship and build it up
37:22 behind and and let
37:24 space-time metric push you through it so
37:26 on so there's a whole cottage industry
37:29 of general relativity theorists who are
37:31 working on various forms of warp drive
37:33 and so on what about the boss Eli
37:37 constraint again in general relativity
37:41 you can solve the equation and come up
37:43 with something called for example a
37:45 wormhole and again I'm not talking about
37:47 fringe physics this is textbook material
37:52 mad vesser's and one of the great
37:56 theorists and if there any engineers in
37:59 the crowd for the engineers in the crowd
38:01 I would point out that well what do you
38:03 mean by velocity of life velocity of
38:05 light is given by a little equation here
38:07 one over the square root of the magnetic
38:10 permeability and the dielectric
38:12 permittivity of the vacuum so if you
38:14 want to go fast the speed of light you
38:16 just simply arrange to reduce the value
38:20 of those constants and now the effective
38:22 speed of light and your engineered
38:24 reason is much higher and so even though
38:27 you're zipping through a faster speed of
38:29 light as far as anyone on the ground is
38:31 concerned actually within your
38:33 engineered space you're not actually
38:35 beating the speed of light but it works
38:37 in principle so the take-home message
38:43 here is reduced time interstellar travel
38:45 either by ET or ourselves in the future
38:48 is not as naive consideration might hold
38:50 fundamentally constrained by physical
38:52 principles and it can be addressed the
38:59 exotic physics and engineering turns
39:00 metric engineering so you might well ask
39:03 ok well then why are we living around
39:05 the universe and well unfortunately you
39:07 solve the equation say oh yeah all these
39:09 things could be done what would be the
39:12 engineering required to do it well in
39:15 our solution so far is oh my gosh we
39:18 have to have so much energy density
39:20 compactified and such a small volume
39:22 there's no way we can get here get there
39:25 with our present engineering smarts so
39:29 it's gonna be for our future for us
39:31 unless we happen to find some kind of
39:34 back door that lets us through so in
39:39 fact that was one of the papers fact is
39:41 the paper that I published so I was one
39:44 of the Defense Intelligence reference
39:48 documents one of the 38 that went up on
39:51 the special
39:53 but by the way as I mentioned we didn't
39:56 tell these authors that we got 38 papers
39:58 generated by that this was some kind of
40:00 spooky UFO bro he says you couldn't even
40:03 publish your work in the open literature
40:05 if you want of course they didn't know
40:07 it had anything to do with UFOs
40:09 so in fact I published my paper advanced
40:12 space propulsion based on vacuum space
40:14 diametric engineering and in a physics
40:17 journal now we kept the lists of these
40:21 titles and the authors still secret and
40:26 then finally somebody through a Freedom
40:28 of Information Act request got a letter
40:31 from John McCain which listed all of the
40:34 papers and the authors and their
40:37 affiliations I thought oh my gosh that
40:40 means my phone is gonna ring off the
40:41 hook saying what he didn't tell me this
40:44 was a UFO program but actually I haven't
40:47 had any pushback so lucky so far
40:50 the papers generally have not been have
40:54 not been released by the Department of
40:55 Defense and resellers community and only
40:58 a few have begun to publish some of the
41:00 workers as I did here
41:03 so anyway is there anything you can
41:05 learn from this that can help us in
41:07 terms of evaluating observations in the
41:10 world associated with unidentified
41:12 aerial phenomena I'll just give you one
41:14 example and I have about a thousand I
41:17 could get but that would take a week or
41:18 so in this room mostly electromagnetic
41:25 energy you can't see why because it's in
41:28 the infrared in the form of heat and
41:31 then it's very narrow band in the
41:33 electromagnetic spectrum that you can
41:34 see and that's what we call you know the
41:38 visible spectrum and then there are
41:40 higher frequencies into the ultraviolet
41:42 and beyond that we that we don't see now
41:45 it turns out that one of the side
41:48 effects of engineering space-time metric
41:51 to get this kind of flight performance
41:54 is it it we call it blue shifts the
41:57 frequencies all the frequencies that are
42:00 involved get moved to a higher frequency
42:03 that's just built into what
42:05 equations say when you generate these
42:07 anomalous effects so what that means
42:11 then and has significance for us is the
42:14 infrared we don't ordinarily see it gets
42:17 blue shifted up into the visible so when
42:21 we hear that these crafts are so bright
42:23 and so luminous when you see them it's
42:25 not nothing
42:27 not a surprise and then what was in the
42:32 visible spectrum gets shifted up into
42:35 let's say the ultraviolet and so if you
42:38 get too close to one of these things
42:40 that are powered up you'll get the
42:42 sunburn often reported by people who
42:46 claimed we've gotten close to a craft
42:48 and if you get too close you might
42:56 actually pick up some of the blue
42:58 shifted radiation from the visible
43:00 that's now blue shifted up into the soft
43:02 x-ray region and get radiation poisoning
43:04 and there have been cases where that's
43:06 been reported so having these set of
43:09 equations and seeing what they predict
43:11 and then going out and mashing against
43:12 real data and that's really a really a
43:15 boon I'll give you one example klaris
43:20 island in Brazil 1977 1978 they had a
43:24 massive wave that lasted for many days
43:28 of like a scene from Close Encounters of
43:33 the Third Kind or whatever hundreds of
43:37 advanced aerospace vehicles were
43:39 observed by civilians and the Brazilian
43:41 Air Force investigative team they set up
43:45 a whole operation called Operation plate
43:47 by the Brazilian Air Force more than a
43:51 thousand pages of documents logs
43:52 sketches and maps more than 500 43:55 photographs 15 hours of motion film
43:58 physiological effects and medical
44:00 injuries and so in our 8 tip program all
44:03 this information was compiled into a big
44:06 database and we did our best to analyze
44:09 the implications so part of what led to
44:14 the engine
44:16 spacetime metric engineering as we call
44:18 it is when you see all these injuries
44:20 you say well what could have caused that
44:22 well this blue shifting would cause it
44:24 where do you get blue shifts you all
44:25 from Einstein's equations if you were
44:28 able to generate the space-time metric
44:30 engineering so you know the medical
44:33 injuries some overlap with current cases
44:36 range all the way from numbness headache
44:39 paralysis some debts in here and so on
44:44 so actually having a model like this
44:46 that can then be matched against data
44:49 even medical injury data's it turned out
44:52 to be significant for us now despite the
44:55 programs of progress in the programs of
44:58 the advance as an atypical space
45:00 verification program let's face as the
45:04 topic is inherently anomalous and no one
45:06 would disagree with that therefore
45:08 despite the reality of the observation
45:10 the topic does not fit smoothly into a
45:12 known profile of the department defense
45:14 or intelligence community structures and
45:17 especially if it's a very black program
45:19 you know the Public Affairs Office
45:21 doesn't even know about it doesn't know
45:23 what you're dealing with so it's it's
45:27 not a happy marriage and because of the
45:30 national security implications so much
45:32 compartmentalization and stovepiping
45:34 it's very difficult to integrate all the
45:37 data and and make rapid progress so
45:40 progress in trying to get to the root of
45:42 all these elements that are being
45:45 observed it's very difficult and the
45:49 advocacy of the issue in government
45:50 circles was not viewed as career
45:53 enhancing people are trying to push this
45:56 inside the pentagon and sign and tell us
45:58 the community always had to deal with
45:59 pushback from higher-level people who
46:03 really didn't know what was going on and
46:06 it was so compartmentalize you couldn't
46:08 brief them tell them what was going on
46:11 so
46:13 a group of us decided that we should set
46:18 up an outreach program in the public
46:20 sector and try to get as much
46:22 information out there as we possibly
46:24 could the goal was to establish a broad
46:28 base high quality scientific community
46:31 of interest to have the conversation in
46:33 the public sector concerning you AP on
46:37 identified area phenomena and other
46:39 related eating edge topics because a lot
46:41 of these topics are linked so we set up
46:45 something called to the stars Academy of
46:48 Arts and Science and if you've been
46:50 following the field you've probably seen
46:52 reference to it
46:54 it was co-founded by Tom DeLonge senior
46:57 intelligence officers from the
46:58 department defense of CIA and
47:00 distinguished research scientists it was
47:03 structured as an SEC regulated public
47:06 benefit corporation so that means a sort
47:09 of lies between crowdfunding in one end
47:11 and your usual IP organization that you
47:17 can buy and sell shares on the public
47:19 market it's kind of in-between and one
47:21 of the requirements I mean people can go
47:24 to the website and buy shares they just
47:27 can't trade them until at some future
47:29 point you have an IPO and you get into
47:32 the regular market and one of the
47:36 requirements of public benefit
47:38 corporation is that you have to provide
47:40 something of value to the public so
47:42 educational aspects are our major
47:45 requirement to have a public benefit
47:48 corporation and the structure is
47:51 transparent you can go to the website to
47:52 the stars Academy downtown and you can
47:56 track everything that's going on so it's
47:59 a very rich web-based community of
48:03 interested up called default which is
48:05 now being developed where there can be a
48:07 lot of information transfer back and
48:08 forth between the public and the
48:10 organization and government entities and
48:14 contractors so it's growing he was set
48:20 up by Tom DeLonge as I said I mean he
48:23 was
48:24 founded blink-182 maybe right man I'd
48:29 never heard of it when I talked to my
48:32 son they said well of course everybody
48:33 knows about blink 182 well he's had a
48:37 lifelong interest in in the UFO et alien
48:42 tech and so on and because of his
48:45 notoriety he can always get into the
48:48 office of various DoD officials and
48:53 high-level executives and aerospace
48:55 corporations and and he made the big
48:58 pitch that you know everyone out in the
49:01 street knows that something's going on
49:02 and the government is saying you know
49:06 there's nothing going on you know that
49:10 that's not good it's not it's not good
49:11 for your industry it's not good for the
49:13 government or whatever you should let me
49:15 setup something where we kind of get a
49:16 conversation going so in fact he was
49:19 able to convince people to do that so we
49:21 formed to the Stars Academy he's the CEO
49:24 I interrupts it you know Lou Elizondo
49:28 probably seen his face if you follow
49:31 this area at all he was a person the
49:35 last person in the Pentagon who actually
49:36 ran the 8a program and he was frustrated
49:40 because he couldn't get more acid assets
49:46 to help resolve the problem and so on
49:49 he's one of those people who've realized
49:51 it wasn't that career enhancing and so
49:53 on so he actually left even though he
49:56 was running the program to join to the
49:58 stars and he's taking very public stance
50:02 and you see him on news programs all the
50:04 time Kerry is on CNN so he's in charge
50:11 of our global affairs and security
50:14 division of T TSA Chris Mellon
50:20 he joined he's still a consultant and
50:25 nationals to the intelligence community
50:27 and national security matters he had a
50:29 20 year career included being deputy
50:31 assistant secretary of defense for
50:33 intelligence he also has been various
50:37 both publicly and you'll see him in
50:40 interviews often if you followed this
50:43 topic
50:44 he's untuck or Carlsen up and down but
50:49 he's also very good at behind-the-scenes
50:52 interactions with senators and
50:56 congressmen and arranging for briefs i
50:59 mean i briefed two congressional
51:01 committees recently myself so so he's
51:06 quite a superstar and helping yes jimsim
51:10 even just retired from CIA he was one of
51:14 the two James Bond kinds of people I've
51:17 heard his stories you know and he needed
51:20 to get a missile out of Iran or whatever
51:24 I mean he'd be the one to figure out how
51:25 to go over there and buy it and so he
51:29 was an Operations Officer both overseas
51:32 and domestically he's on our board he's
51:36 in charge of operations vice president
51:38 for operations
51:39 Steve justice who had briefed many times
51:44 at highly classified levels when he was
51:46 running black programs that Lockheed
51:49 Martin skunk works and I couldn't
51:52 believe it
51:53 that about the time I joined he left
51:57 skunk works and agreed to join also so
52:02 he's uncharged if I said he said he's a
52:04 vice perhaps well he's he's in charge of
52:08 the aerospace division of TTS a
52:11 brilliant guy knows everything
52:14 billion-dollar programs all black that
52:16 he was in charge of I mean we're talking
52:18 about heavy hitters here and then
52:22 there's me
52:24 I had my physics background happy as a
52:27 clam PhD from Stanford working on lasers
52:30 got my first laser patent lifecell a PhD
52:33 student or whatever but in addition to
52:36 that life which is resulted and then oh
52:38 some 200 publications and three patents
52:42 and so on in the background I also had
52:44 this other life because I started out as
52:48 a naval intelligence officer stationed
52:51 at the National Security Agency and I
52:52 say between my masters and my PhD before
52:57 he went out to Stanford to get my PhD
52:58 and so I had that background and so it
53:02 turns out that every time there's a
53:03 problem somebody wants to solve and they
53:05 want a physicist whose head clearances
53:08 and they know they can trust and they
53:10 know the area is so weird that no other
53:12 physicians are going to agree to do
53:13 anything about it
53:14 who you gonna call that's how I get
53:18 involved these programs and we have a
53:21 couple of people are really savvy people
53:24 who've run investment groups to handle
53:27 the financial aspects of tts a and so
53:32 the SEC filings and everything is all
53:34 out there on the websites of it that's a
53:37 very transparent organization of course
53:41 we don't all tell everything we know but
53:44 Chris Mullins also the chair of a
53:48 science advisory board and several
53:50 distinguished scientists snackin
53:53 emissions so if you go to the website
53:55 you can see their CVS and backgrounds
53:58 you'll see that many of them have been
54:00 involved at CIA or Department of Defense
54:03 or whatever with fantastic backgrounds
54:06 of information so they can make a real
54:08 contribution and there's a science
54:10 advisory board to make sure that we
54:11 stand straight and narrow with any
54:13 flames we have so what RTT essays goals
54:19 first of all promote the concept that
54:22 forefront topics should not be
54:24 considered taboo for investigation by
54:27 scientists I mean that's always been a
54:30 problem with these kinds of topics
54:32 remote viewing
54:34 telepathy psychokinesis ufos
54:37 search for extra intelligence and of
54:40 course to generate funding I mean that's
54:42 why we have a website where people can
54:43 send money to underwrite significant
54:46 research in the areas but because of our
54:49 public benefit corporation element we
54:52 want to have user friendly databases so
54:54 they can be universal access to whatever
54:56 information we can come up with and then
54:58 we can reveal and to provide positives
55:01 for for collaboration between government
55:05 aerospace industry academia to
55:09 accomplish all these things for example
55:11 we just recently assigned something
55:13 called an army crater with the army
55:19 create a stands for cooperative research
55:23 and development agreement and so we're
55:28 still doing things with the government
55:31 as well as with the public but since
55:34 part of our remit has public benefit
55:38 corporation we create entertainment
55:39 properties books documentaries films on
55:41 like on it also makes money to help
55:44 support the research for example there's
55:48 a series of secret machine series is now
55:51 two volumes out which is science fiction
55:54 written by Tom DeLonge and another
55:58 author which kind of incorporates the
56:02 ideas that we're talking about only a
56:04 fiction level there's also another
56:06 series God's Man and more by Peter
56:09 lavinda
56:11 that explores humanity's history going
56:15 back thousands of years
56:16 unclaimed interaction with other kinds
56:22 of beings whether it's angels or aliens
56:25 or jinn or who knows what they are so
56:29 it's it's a nice compendium of the fact
56:33 that there's a rich history throughout
56:36 our whole culture about interaction with
56:38 non-human beings so the structures we
56:43 have a science structure it has a series
56:45 of programs
56:46 an aerospace structure for example a
56:50 beam energy propulsion launched a
56:52 program is one we're trying to get
56:53 funded at this point ordinarily when you
56:56 put something into orbit you got you're
56:58 carrying all that rocket fuel and that
57:00 takes up most of the volume and get a
57:04 very small pane what turns out you've
57:07 leave all the rocket fuel at home and
57:08 just have really giant lasers on the
57:11 ground that then hit the back of a
57:14 satellite of CubeSat that you want to
57:16 launch and so there's a whole industry
57:18 there already proven by NASA and the Air
57:21 Force to be a viable industry but the
57:24 infrastructure he hasn't been set up
57:25 because I mean we got Rockets working
57:27 who wants to put a billion dollars in to
57:31 a new industry before we actually can
57:33 use it anyway that's something that
57:36 should be done and and once that area
57:38 gets filled out and brought up to speed
57:43 the cost for launching satellites into
57:46 orbit will be 10% of what it is now so
57:51 everybody recognizes the economic
57:52 potential but who wants to put in all
57:54 the money to build it until a decade or
57:57 now from the actually use it and make
57:59 money so it's it's a tough row to hoe
58:02 and of course because the entertainment
58:04 and public interface documentaries TV
58:08 books and so on so what our activities
58:10 today well I mean some sense we were
58:12 responsible for legitimizing the topic
58:15 in the mainstream press so that was
58:19 really a sea change about this subject
58:21 area and TTS a working in public and
58:25 also behind the scenes this is one of
58:28 their successes as I say Lou Elizondo
58:33 he's out there top media presenting the
58:40 facts so that that's a big change and
58:43 it's given the quality of the sources
58:45 coming out from the shadows I mean acts
58:47 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -
58:48 operated f-18 pilots important
58:51 government officials the bar has been
58:53 raised on legitimization so after that
58:56 New York Times article
58:57 December 2017 the ridicule factor has by
59:01 and large gone way down in comparison to
59:04 the acceptance that there's something
59:07 here the three high quality f-18 59:09 videotapes they've unidentified aerial
59:11 phenomena I showed you one here you can
59:14 go on the internet or to the TTS a
59:15 website and see the others they've been
59:21 pulled out of the Pentagon and release
59:23 due to the pressure from primarily Lou
59:26 Elizondo and we've set up meetings with
59:31 people in foreign UAP programs some of
59:36 them have promised to provide us data
59:38 and even materials from crashed craft in
59:44 the past whenever or some foreign
59:47 company a country came up with some not
59:50 say some material or whatever call in
59:52 United States give it to them it
59:54 disappears into black hole they never
59:56 find out anything about it so that's the
59:59 end of that well we're coming on as a
60:01 public benefit corporation say you know
60:03 you give us pieces whatever we learn in
60:06 our evaluation is going to go on a
60:07 website for the public so it's not going
60:10 to disappear in a black hole so suddenly
60:12 we have generals in other countries I
60:17 met with the general from Brazil and the
60:19 sole issue myself really willing to
60:23 cooperate and of course from
60:26 negotiations medialis to share
60:27 documentation or in process some of you
60:31 may know or have seen unidentified it
60:35 was the History Channel series of
60:39 several episodes that went forward last
60:43 year we're now recording the second
60:46 season and unlike ancient aliens on
60:51 History Channel there's a lot of
60:52 speculation and stuff that's fascinating
60:55 but you don't know how much of it is is
60:57 this real and also unlike things like
61:00 UFO Hunters where people go out and talk
61:04 to people and you get a pretty
61:05 sensationalistic view
61:07 the undignified program really went out
61:09 of its way to like really just reveal
61:12 the facts
61:13 so most of lose time was going around
61:17 interviewing the f-18 pilots
61:19 interviewing the radar operators on the
61:23 ships and that that kind of thing so it
61:28 was pretty straight line
61:30 no no exaggerated went out of our way in
61:34 that whole program you'll never hear
61:35 anybody say the word alien I mean until
61:39 it's absolutely nailed down what's going
61:41 on speculation is off the table
61:44 just the facts Pam that's it we'll
61:48 follow the data where the data leads us
61:51 it'll be tall but that's what it is
61:54 follow the data now some of the pressure
61:59 and especially behind the scenes stuff
62:01 the navy finally confirmed for the first
62:04 time that those videos really are
62:08 unidentified aerial phenomena I mean
62:10 after the videos were released you had
62:13 everybody and their cousins saying oh
62:15 well maybe it's just some new drone that
62:17 the Navy or the Air Force is testing and
62:21 and whatever I mean why should I think
62:23 it's really that they don't know what it
62:25 is but because of the pressure and the
62:28 Hawaii requests and briefing behind the
62:30 scenes the Navy finally agreed to come
62:33 forward and say they really are
62:34 unidentified for example in a Politico
62:38 Brian benders writing about defense said
62:42 the US Navy is drafting new guidelines
62:45 for reporting UFOs I'm me up until this
62:47 time I've told you there were decades of
62:49 Navy pilots running into these things
62:52 all over the place but they never
62:54 reported them why because they were
62:57 concerned their superiors would tell
62:58 them okay you've been smoking dope or
63:01 something I mean what's going on so no
63:04 one wanted to lose their flight status
63:05 by reporting UFOs so they didn't now
63:09 because of the pressure
63:10 the Navy has come out and put out
63:12 official edicts to the f-18 and other
63:18 pilots saying if you see
63:20 UFO first of all grab all the data you
63:23 can and I've seen some neat ones where
63:25 the pilots actually use their cell
63:27 phones to take a picture and you must
63:32 report it so that's now part of the new
63:34 culture and the Navy even is emitted
63:39 they providing a series of briefings for
63:41 senior by senior naval intelligence
63:44 officer as well as aviators who reported
63:47 hazards to aviation safety so this is
63:50 not just lying and a little cloister of
63:54 people would like to kind of be part of
63:56 this kind of thing no it's it's it's
63:59 being briefed you won't hear who's being
64:02 briefed because they don't don't want to
64:05 make an issue of it but there are a lot
64:07 of people at high places being briefed I
64:10 even saw on the Tucker Carlson show that
64:12 president dropped with told it these
64:15 beams are going on what are you thinking
64:17 I sort of I don't know about that but on
64:20 the other hand I our privates are really
64:22 short people sauce anyway so that's the
64:27 back story in the forward story the back
64:29 story is dia set up this program one in
64:34 2008 that had a whole precedence of
64:38 other programs other programs ongoing
64:42 and in the forward story is some of us
64:45 coming forward to form to the stars
64:47 Academy to try to get a better
64:50 acceptance and more conversation out of
64:53 the public and so that's what we've been
64:55 doing that's our forward story
64:57 contribution so that's that's the story
65:01 thanks for your for your interest
65:03 [Applause]
65:14 okay it's a reasonable question well how
65:17 how does our organization in our
65:19 viewpoint my viewpoint consider the
65:23 other viewpoints out there for example
65:25 there's a whole group of people who are
65:27 talking about we have bases on Mars as a
65:30 secret UFO program we got spacecraft all
65:35 over the place in the solar system and
65:39 many other organizations reaching
65:42 certain viewpoints like that from our
65:45 standpoint we're just following and I
65:47 personally mean I'm just following the
65:50 data and what I can really get my hands
65:52 around somehow and so when I read many
65:55 of these other or hear many of these
65:57 other claims that you know we have a
66:01 secret space program already ongoing I
66:04 mean I can't absolutely refute it but I
66:08 have no evidence and in my programs I've
66:11 been involved with I haven't seen any
66:13 evidence like that so I just put all
66:16 that in a grey basket on the shelf and
66:18 stick with what we can follow with data
66:23 and basically my colleagues within T TSA
66:26 are doing the same thing I mean we don't
66:29 even go it so far as to say when we know
66:32 they're et spaceships some people may
66:35 think that but we don't say anything
66:38 along those lines because until we have
66:40 hard evidence that's what we committed
66:42 ourselves to having in the public
66:45 conversation things that can be verified
66:48 documented and so on and we'll leave the
66:50 speculation to elsewhere
66:57 I'll soon war probably be available for
67:02 for civilian use what sparked some more
67:08 to the question better a lot more to the
67:13 question certainly we have people
67:17 working on the theoretical physics of it
67:19 as I say space-time metric engineering
67:22 and so on that would say that in
67:23 principle warp drive is possible or
67:27 wormhole access out of the cosmos as
67:30 possible we've all seen many of us seen
67:34 elvers interstellar which is a terrific
67:36 movie the science advisor to that movie
67:39 was Kip Thorne one of the top general
67:42 relativity people from Princeton so the
67:46 science in that program is absolutely
67:49 absolutely perfect in fact he expressed
67:53 the fact that he's really glad that that
67:56 movie got made because there are a lot
67:58 of solutions and general relativity that
68:01 you would have to understand to make the
68:04 concepts that we're shown in the movie
68:06 but no academic budget was able to put
68:10 up the money to run all those computer
68:12 programs but in Hollywood they did and
68:15 so in fact they they learned a lot and
68:17 were able to publish things based on the
68:21 what's been what what was done by the
68:23 Hollywood industry either industry but
68:27 in terms of generally thinking that
68:30 we're going to get from here to there in
68:33 our lifetime or maybe even within a
68:35 century right now we don't see a path
68:37 forward so either it's as hard as the
68:42 equations would now predict and
68:45 therefore warp drive a work dry probably
68:48 is going to happen for
68:49 a century or maybe more or there's some
68:54 backdoor to the Alamo so to speak that
68:58 we can do an end-around run and find
69:01 some lower energy way of generating
69:04 things like warp drive and wormhole and
69:07 so on that we just haven't discovered
69:09 yet so of course that's a big issue
69:12 behind government and aerospace
69:16 corporation programs is to try to figure
69:18 out how these things work and see if
69:21 there is some unknown shortcut that we
69:24 could take so at this point all I could
69:27 say for sure is it's going to be a
69:30 century or more and if it pops up to be
69:35 usable within our lifetimes
69:37 that's because somebody isn't really
69:38 found of magic key due to the lock so at
69:41 this point we don't see where it will
69:44 come from this is a question about what
69:47 about free energy technology I mean a
69:50 lot of the energy buffs out there in
69:54 fact for a long time I was one myself
69:55 because I it's been a number of years
69:59 investigating potential applications of
70:02 zero-point energy so called and one of
70:06 the you might say attractive aspects as
70:10 well as all that energy and the vacuum
70:11 fluctuations maybe we can tap some of it
70:14 and so in fact we even set up a maverick
70:16 inventor program in in our lab and we
70:20 said ok as smart as we think we are we
70:22 may not be able to find the answer but
70:24 maybe it's some kind of garage who
70:26 doesn't know enough physics and he does
70:29 some stupid experiment that no
70:30 physicists would ever think of doing and
70:32 he happens to stumble on whoa there's an
70:34 energy source and so in our maverick
70:37 inventor program we put out the word
70:39 that if you think you got quote a free
70:42 energy device and over-unity energy
70:43 source of whatever bring it to us we
70:47 have this giant million dollar
70:48 calorimeter that's excellent for
70:50 measuring energy and we've had people
70:54 show up from as far away as China to
70:57 have their devices looked at I looked at
70:59 many cold fusion
71:01 those that were brought to us and so on
71:03 and I'm sorry to say that even though
71:06 our Investor at the time said you know
71:08 just find one that works and you know
71:10 we're all going to be trillionaires
71:12 their truth the matter is we are our
71:16 website is a graveyard of dashed and
71:18 vintage dreams so at this point I
71:21 haven't seen any evidence for workable
71:25 new free-energy over-unity energy device
71:29 even though i mean it's interesting for
71:32 example vacuum fluctuation energy put a
71:35 couple of plates up electromagnetic
71:38 energy fluctuating in the vacuum as it
71:42 turns out the modes that can exist
71:44 between the plates is restricted because
71:47 you have to me it matches the boundary
71:49 condition there's no restrictions on the
71:51 modes outside the place it'll push the
71:53 place together so-called Casimir effect
71:55 and hey you got a puff of energy out of
71:58 the vacuum fluctuations whoa but then
72:01 what do you do if you pull the plates
72:02 apart you have to put in as much energy
72:04 as you got so that's not the way to go I
72:09 know of one way that I think should be
72:11 explored and and my colleagues and I had
72:14 worked on it
72:15 Berni Haitian Garrett Modell and they
72:19 actually got a patent on it a very very
72:22 difficult experiment to do circulating
72:26 hydrogen gas through nanopores and some
72:30 possibility of doing something but it's
72:33 a very expensive experiment way out
72:36 there in terms of the technology you
72:38 need to do it so at this point I have
72:40 yet to see even though I've had a lot of
72:42 interest in it any new energy devices to
72:45 come out of these new concepts sorry to
72:48 say
72:50 this is a question about Richard Doty as
72:52 stated on the Internet a very
72:54 controversial figure as many of you
72:56 would know and he stated that he had
72:59 worked for us for I guess over a decade
73:03 that was the period in which we were
73:05 really investigating all kinds of
73:09 aspects of the phenomena that I talked
73:12 about today and so we had all kinds of
73:14 consultants and Richard Doty is one of
73:17 them
73:18 and so he gathered up information that
73:22 that he could gather up and thought we'd
73:24 be interested in but he was like one of
73:26 many and so even though he's a very
73:30 controversial figure out there we're not
73:33 sure if the data he provided what was
73:35 the percentage of that we could really
73:37 count on okay we we didn't we didn't
73:40 want to leave any stone unturned any
73:42 anything that might be hiding under a
73:44 rock so we had several people and he was
73:47 one who consulted with us and you know
73:50 he told us about various sightings and
73:53 [Music]
73:55 certain aspects of government programs
73:57 and so on so so what he says is true and
74:02 be too long to try to go into the day
74:05 provided us with some what we evaluated
74:07 and couldn't verify and some of it we
74:10 couldn't verify so we're pretty sure
74:13 might not exactly be the case but he was
74:16 a counterintelligence officer so that
74:17 that would be okay that would be his job
74:20 so anyway we interacted with all levels
74:24 of people in and out of the government
74:26 so it's not surprising that you know if
74:29 we were doing all of this and trying to
74:30 find out everything we could find out
74:32 why would we leave out of our toolkit
74:35 somebody who's making these big claims
74:38 and was clearly part of a program so
74:40 yeah we we worked with him I have to
74:43 like him as an individual
74:45 he's a nice guy okay the question I had
74:48 to do with 238 papers that we that we
74:52 commissioned that gave us looks at all
74:56 kinds of advanced technologies with our
74:59 question though where will your area of
75:02 expertise be by the year 2050 they could
75:05 make a contribution to aerospace
75:07 engineering and flight and so on
75:09 and so a lot of the information that
75:12 came out of those programs is you know
75:14 pretty startling I mean so it was very
75:17 you know quite originally quite
75:20 sensitive and we had to beat up on
75:22 people and some aerospace corporations
75:24 they were come on tell me something
75:26 about plasma physics therefore proposed
75:28 and then what I can is classified well
75:30 you know dig something out there so
75:32 anyway because these were unclassified
75:34 papers so given the broad span as you
75:38 could see in my listing of the 38 areas
75:41 of new technologies coming along I think
75:46 it's reasonable to think that at some
75:47 point there will be a fusion that will
75:50 really really really make a big
75:51 difference of course way back when
75:55 early people investigating
75:57 electromagnetic effects did things who
76:02 could have predicted a cell phone one of
76:05 the one of the great examples I have X
76:08 was given to me my Steve justice from
76:10 Lucky Martin skunkworks who's now in the
76:14 art of TTS a he said that he found an
76:18 article and 19 something or other years
76:21 and years ago saying well you know
76:24 someday there will be an army officer
76:28 could carry a 50 pound pack on his back
76:31 and be able to tell me exactly where he
76:34 is on the surface of the earth and
76:36 that'll probably happen in 10 or 15 76:38 years of course we now all have that in
76:41 our cell phones so it's always the case
76:43 that predicting ahead usually falls
76:46 short rather than over estimating where
76:50 you
76:51 so all I can say is that given the level
76:54 of technologies that are being pursued
76:56 in every area and they're being pursued
76:59 with better and better instrumentation
77:00 so the product per unit time is actually
77:06 going up exponentially so I'm certain
77:09 that you know within 10 20 years or
77:12 whatever we're going to have some
77:13 amazing technologies that if I were try
77:15 to list them right now any reasonable
77:19 person would say well that's ridiculous
77:20 or not I'm going to get from here to
77:22 there so so that that that's that's the
77:25 point of TTS a and many aerospace
77:27 corporations we work with is let's just
77:29 plumb everything in sight and see how
77:32 far and fast we can get he suggests work
77:39 5 30 years since I'm living in the
77:43 present I would say not a chance
77:45 I know but thirty years from now you
77:48 might look back and say what you know
77:51 you should have known better
77:52 of course we're going to get it why
77:54 don't you say something you have the
77:58 question about another sorted part of my
78:01 past
78:03 working with ESP and remote viewing and
78:06 Ingo Swann and so on that was really
78:11 really quite a deal there's an
78:12 interesting background about how that
78:14 happened and I should tell you at the
78:17 time I was a very straight arrow
78:18 physicist and in fact I had just caught
78:21 a textbook while I was at Stanford on
78:24 fundamentals of quantum electronics
78:25 which was a graduate level textbook
78:28 published in English French Russian and
78:30 Chinese I was at the top of my game and
78:35 but one of the things that bothered me
78:37 and bothered many of my physics
78:38 colleagues were well what about
78:41 consciousness what about sentience is it
78:45 still atoms and molecules all the way
78:47 down it's just too complicated for us to
78:49 figure out or are there some additional
78:51 fields beyond what we know of the four
78:54 forces and so on and so that bugged me
78:57 writing a textbook didn't know the
78:59 answer but a lot of my colleagues so I
79:02 was always on the search for were there
79:04 any evidence that there's other kinds of
79:06 fields that we don't know about you know
79:08 we should find out it was about that
79:11 time that Cleve Backster who is famous
79:15 well he's the famous polygraph expert
79:17 taught polygraph to FBI CIA law
79:22 enforcement organizations and one day on
79:25 a lark he just connected his polygraph
79:27 up to a plant and he saw the signals
79:30 coming out of the plant that looked
79:32 pretty much like what he sees on people
79:34 and so he said boy I think I'm gonna
79:37 threaten the plant like I would a person
79:38 and so he got out as a matchbook and he
79:42 saw a big response on the plant he
79:44 thought oh my gosh maybe this means
79:46 plants are sentient at some level so
79:49 they started doing experiments we had a
79:51 plant here and plant here he do
79:53 something to disturb this plant and this
79:55 plant would show us signal and so that
79:57 was published and I saw that and I was
80:01 ruminating over my idea about
80:05 they're extra fields or whatever so I
80:07 said okay I'm gonna set up a really cool
80:08 experiment
80:09 100% of physics experiment nothing to do
80:12 with remote viewing nothing to do with
80:14 the ESPE nothing to do with
80:15 psychokinesis I'm just going to grow
80:17 some algae culture together separate the
80:19 two cultures zap this one with a laser
80:23 and see if that one responded measure
80:25 the velocity of propagation between the
80:27 two so I bundled all that up into a
80:29 proposal and sent it off to fleet Baxter
80:33 in New York and so what do you think of
80:36 my idea to try to kind of replicate your
80:37 effect and a real high-tech kind of way
80:40 well it's one of those things where your
80:42 life takes an unbelievable turn based on
80:45 two random coincidence it turned out the
80:47 Cleve Baxter and Ingo Swann the famous
80:50 psychic and remote viewer met at a
80:52 cocktail party in New York City and they
80:55 were talking about what they do and so
80:56 Cleve invited him over to his lab to see
80:59 if he could affect his plants as the
81:02 plants would respond tone while he was
81:04 there he saw my proposal on Cleves desk
81:07 so he wrote me a letter saying well if
81:09 you're interested in that sort of
81:10 borderline between animate and inanimate
81:12 physics why do you want to deal with
81:14 hal-g culture they can't tell you what's
81:17 happening you should be dealing with
81:18 somebody like me
81:20 ordinarily I mean not really as I say it
81:22 straight our physicists I would just
81:24 throw that in the garbage
81:25 except attached to the letter was a big
81:28 report of an experiment that been done
81:31 in City College in New York
81:32 we're on command working with Gertrude
81:35 smiler there he was able to make the
81:38 temperature of temperature measuring
81:40 devices that were in thermos bottles on
81:43 the other side of the lab go up and down
81:45 on command I said oh my gosh that's you
81:48 know that's physics so I decided to
81:50 invite him out to Stanford Research
81:52 Institute where it was at the time and I
81:55 told my physics colleagues hey I've got
81:57 this psychic coming oh my god they're
82:00 all frauds and charlatans you know
82:03 you've got to really have a good
82:04 experiment well as it turns out I did
82:06 have a good experiment it turned out
82:08 that we had a million dollar or what
82:11 special magnetometer that was being
82:15 built that had been built to detect
82:18 quarks which are sub nuclear particles
82:20 anyway there's this look quantum ship
82:22 down inside this device surrounded by
82:25 electrical shielding surrounded by
82:27 magnetic shielding surrounded by
82:28 superconducting fielding no way that
82:32 anything from the outside could affect
82:33 that so I grabbed him by the arm I took
82:37 him over there and say you know I sort
82:38 of have a kind of a high-tech version of
82:40 what you did in New York those
82:42 temperature measuring devices I wanted
82:45 to see if you can affect this so
82:48 uncommanded signals on there they were
82:52 absolutely undoubtably effects of what
82:56 he was doing and of course they graduate
82:59 student whose life depended on this
83:00 being interval from the outside only
83:03 that there must be some bubbles in the
83:05 liquid helium line you know I only get
83:07 it let me check let me check so I'm sure
83:10 that was just some kind of good some
83:11 kind of coincidence and I was running
83:13 fine said okay you know God you will try
83:15 that again
83:16 you reproduce the same effect and so
83:21 you're just doing against I might get
83:23 you got to go get it go get a break I go
83:25 go there you know the restaurant or
83:27 something and let me find out what's
83:30 wrong with my system I'm running just
83:32 fine we came back in and said well I'm
83:37 sure you can't do that again he did it
83:39 again and I'm not talking about a little
83:41 signal peeking out of out of the noise
83:43 I'm talking about something that
83:45 generally looks like that and instead of
83:46 cook so of course he kicked us out of
83:50 the lab said never again the Navy had
83:54 paid for the development of same with
83:56 you how did this happen
83:58 the result of that was that I wrote it
84:00 up I'm gonna know it's a long answer to
84:02 your question I wrote it up circulate
84:04 around of physics friends somebody
84:05 dropped in on a CIA desk suddenly the
84:08 DCI agent sends on my doorstep they said
84:10 Oh have we been looking for you I said
84:14 why what'd I do said look Russia and the
84:18 East Bloc countries are spending
84:20 millions of dollars for
84:21 years on ESP research no scientists in
84:24 America please there is such a thing and
84:27 yet you did this experiment we looked
84:29 into your background and saw that you
84:31 had all these clearances because you had
84:33 been a naval intelligence officer
84:34 stationed at NSA so we knew we could
84:37 count on talking to you your des RI we
84:40 have lots of bright black projects here
84:42 anyway why don't you invite income out
84:45 here and look into this and of course
84:47 their hope was that I'd invite him out
84:49 to some really tough experiments and it
84:53 wouldn't work and they can just take
84:55 this off the plate and never have to
84:56 worry about it well that's not what
84:59 happened to grew into 23-year it's a
85:02 million-dollar project and we ended up I
85:04 mean it was a big deal
85:06 we trained army intelligence officers to
85:08 use remote viewing I've briefed all
85:11 kinds of people including Bill Casey
85:14 when he was Reagan's director of CIA and
85:16 directions of dia I appeared before
85:18 Senate no congressional intelligence
85:23 committees and so on you know yeah it
85:24 came out to be a big thing it was still
85:26 all top-secret all wrapped up but now
85:29 it's all been Declassified you can buy a
85:32 big book called Stargate chronicles on
85:35 the internet and see all of the reports
85:38 we wrote that I thought would never see
85:39 the light of day all because Ingo Swann
85:42 did what he did and then showed up at
85:46 that cocktail party and so he it was
85:49 think about Ingo Swann sitterson him was
85:53 he's very inward looking he could figure
85:56 out what he was doing and so he was able
85:59 to lay out a procedure for how to
86:01 accomplish the remote viewing tasks and
86:03 then we were able to train those with
86:05 other people so he was a real
86:07 contributor he's a very very smart guy
86:10 and by the way you might think that
86:12 psychic say try to take it you know
86:15 credit for anything no he was the
86:18 hardest guy if we said well that looks
86:20 like that really work if he could find a
86:22 loophole say well we're not going to
86:23 count that you know if you if you accept
86:26 something that's kind of borderline it's
86:29 kind of loophole and it destroys the
86:31 credibility of all the
86:32 research so he was one of the toughest
86:33 people to accept that there had been an
86:37 actual result so I always take great
86:40 respect for him the question is here
86:45 from colleague of mine Erik Davis who
86:47 worked for me he's now at the Aerospace
86:50 Corporation and he had mentioned that I
86:53 had written a paper it's not been
86:56 published it's been somewhat circulated
86:58 what I call ultra terrestrials as they
87:03 said we're just following the data and
87:05 so I've got my colleagues who say oh my
87:09 god the aliens are here I've got Jack
87:12 Foley telling me no it's it's these are
87:15 interdimensional you know whatever
87:16 whatever so I decided to write down all
87:20 options and put it in the paper called
87:24 ultra terrestrials and circulated among
87:27 my colleagues to say we can't overlook
87:30 anything
87:31 we must not come to a conclusion before
87:33 we looked at every possibility so who
87:36 knows maybe they're ETS living here they
87:40 got stranded here millennia ago or maybe
87:43 there's some aerospace corporations put
87:46 all the stuff together and it's being
87:48 hidden or maybe it's maybe it's a means
87:52 or maybe it's a sign list at all
87:55 possible or maybe it's just trapped time
87:59 travelers from the future that happen to
88:00 be showing you so I put all of the
88:03 aspects of what it might be given that
88:06 we can't say for sure and then what are
88:10 the elements you would look for to find
88:12 out if this were true or this were true
88:14 or this were true so this whole idea of
88:18 quote ultra terrestrials is something
88:20 that kind of floats around in the
88:21 community a great book by Mac Tony I
88:25 think is his name has it has a title I'm
88:30 almost like that so Soniya it was just
88:33 it was just a circulated think piece to
88:36 realize okay we should quit being
88:40 reporters and turn into intelligence
88:44 officers
88:44 and go out and seek data instead of just
88:47 speaking at the passive in waiting for
88:49 the government to tell us what or
88:51 waiting for the aliens to tell us well
88:53 you know whatever no we should turn into
88:57 policemen who are searching for clues
88:58 and trying to build a case for this
89:01 possibility or this possibility or this
89:04 possibility and fleshing out those
89:06 possibilities you know if it's this well
89:09 then maybe there are a lot of
89:10 corporations involved so we should be
89:12 looking into their financial structure
89:14 or maybe it's this well we should be so
89:17 anyway it was a circulated paper which
89:19 I'm not ready to publish him oh this
89:23 question has to do with the fact that
89:25 there have been people in general and
89:27 people within T TSA specifically who are
89:30 talking about the apparent observation
89:33 of craft who can move through any kind
89:37 of media they can be maybe coming from
89:39 outer space and then they're in our
89:41 atmosphere and then they dive into the
89:43 water
89:45 that's a tough aerospace engineering to
89:52 try to come to grips with we do have
89:54 craft that can kind of go in the water
89:57 and then come out that are but you know
90:00 not now are the kind of characteristics
90:01 that are being observed and then she
90:03 added under that well what about going
90:06 into matter well it just turns out that
90:10 one of the outcomes in the list of weird
90:13 things from space diametric engineering
90:16 is that materials under those conditions
90:20 are so hardened that they're like made
90:23 out of a diamond or better and the rest
90:26 of the world looks like butter
90:28 so even going into matter going
90:32 high-velocity into the water or whatever
90:36 is one of the predictions of the
90:39 modeling so haven't talked about us
90:43 specifically I mean there there have
90:44 been some reported cases but you know
90:47 they came from the public so you don't
90:50 know whether to believe it or not of
90:51 craft quite in the mountains and stuff
90:54 like that no explosion no so anyway
90:57 those
90:58 that's all just debris intellectual
91:01 debris on the table that we're trying to
91:03 put together like a put a jigsaw puzzle
91:05 and so if there hasn't been any
91:08 particular reason not to talk about it
91:10 or to talk about it I mean the data we
91:13 have and before holding the data that's
91:15 what we want to concentrate we don't
91:17 have good data on that so I'm happening
91:20 to be personally interested because one
91:22 of the predictors of the modeling but
91:24 sorry that's that's where that stands
91:28 okay since it's a question that sort of
91:31 implies Wilson since you're inverted and
91:33 involved in all these sordid areas have
91:37 you thought about using remove merely to
91:39 try to answer questions about craft and
91:42 so on there have been attempts by some
91:45 of the critics could we started
91:47 reviewing programs
91:48 army intelligence and so on and those
91:50 people have all now retired from army
91:54 intelligence and they're now out in the
91:55 public giving courses on remote viewing
91:58 and a number of them have attempted to
92:01 get answers to questions about UAP using
92:06 remote viewing as far as coming up with
92:10 something solid I mean a couple of times
92:12 when I when we had some pretty good
92:16 evidence of a craft caught under good
92:21 national means sit remote viewers just
92:26 over tried to figure out how it was
92:28 operating the descriptions were - we
92:32 would say right brain I mean turns out
92:34 remote viewing is very much of a right
92:36 brained artistic kind of thing as
92:38 opposed to a left brain analytical thing
92:40 so a tip to try to figure out technology
92:44 about it by remote viewers has not been
92:47 particularly useful a lot of anomalies
92:53 show up I mean we had one of our best
92:55 remote viewers was Pat price and in
93:00 addition doing all the wonderful stuff
93:02 he was doing for us just to give you an
93:04 idea how good a remote viewer can be
93:07 this is during the first first four
93:13 years of Nixon's presidency he came in
93:18 one morning and he said well you know
93:20 Nixon's not going to make it through the
93:22 second term because there's something in
93:24 his office that's going to harm him well
93:29 we had to report that to the CIA and
93:31 they went over there and they looked for
93:33 toxic substances hidden microwave
93:35 generator they couldn't find anything of
93:38 course we now know by history that it
93:41 was the tape recorder that did him in
93:44 when he told us that we said oh my gosh
93:49 that means Spiro Agnew will be President
93:52 and he says no he goes first well it
93:57 turns out he did go first for some kind
93:59 of money laundering scheme or whatever
94:01 and so he got a guy with that kind of
94:05 ability and you know one day comes in
94:08 and says well I found four UFO bases on
94:10 on the planet now give you their
94:13 locations well I didn't really want to
94:17 report that but I had to and so it turns
94:21 out one of my contract miners one of the
94:23 locations was in Australia nirmaan zero
94:29 and so I told my contract mother I guess
94:32 you know it's crazy a list of places so
94:35 on he says well I know the station keep
94:38 her in Australia I'll call him out there
94:41 I won't tell him why I'm calling but
94:43 I'll just see if what I can find out so
94:45 they called him up and said you know I'm
94:48 interested that area around nazia I
94:50 think I immediately said oh you mean
94:51 with UFOs or flying around so does that
94:55 mean that it might be possible to
94:56 collected your photos using remote
95:00 viewing it may be but I do not know of
95:03 any actual effort under good
95:08 circumstances with great follow up to
95:13 take advantage of remote viewing in the
95:15 UAP area
95:16 so that's something left for the future
95:21 so I guess the question really has to do
95:23 with specifically about TTS a or we're
95:27 pursuing let's say advanced physics that
95:31 might include the more arcane aspect
95:35 right now we're not pursuing elements of
95:38 you wants to know for your pursuing
95:40 elements of or what about consciousness
95:42 with regard to you ap phenomenon so on
95:45 are we pursuing anything like that
95:46 within TTS a not particularly at this
95:54 point I know that there I know people
95:57 who are pursuing that kind of thing in
95:59 fact in the absolutely straight arrow
96:01 quantum physics community now that we're
96:04 digging into things like quantum
96:06 entanglement and so on there's a lot of
96:08 discussion of its consciousness just an
96:12 emergent epiphenomena of our atoms and
96:15 molecules or just consciousness have its
96:18 own sub platform in which the physical
96:21 universe is built and so they're real
96:23 physicists who have a really good
96:25 credentials they're actually doing
96:27 experiments to try to answer questions
96:30 like that because it's built in quantum
96:33 physics that we have nonlocality
96:35 and it's built in quantum physics that
96:39 there is entanglement over time and
96:44 space so there's a lot of you might say
96:47 the philosophical elements of very
96:50 straight academic quantum physics
96:52 they're looking into exactly those kinds
96:55 of issues of the connection between
96:56 consciousness and what otherwise we call
96:59 the physical world so you know if
97:02 anything comes out of that that looks
97:04 useful you can be sure that I and my
97:06 colleagues at ETS a will try to see if
97:09 we can take advantage of the knowledge
97:12 that's being developed but right now I
97:15 don't I don't know if anyone
97:16 particularly located that
97:20 well the question is is there just sort
97:23 of one type of UAV or UFO or whatever we
97:26 see out there or are there many
97:29 different kinds and if we made a
97:32 connection whether these might be alien
97:35 or not and so on the scattering of
97:39 options that are absolutely picked up on
97:44 the best of our military platforms are
97:47 all over the map I don't know if you've
97:49 heard for example there was a sphere
97:51 with a cube inside dashes between two of
97:55 our f-18 pilots in fact that's the event
97:58 that caused the aviation safety thing to
98:02 then move to the element of requesting
98:05 that pilots report their UFO sightings
98:07 because it was an aviation safety issue
98:09 not a boo-boo issue and so and then
98:14 there's a tic-tac shape and then there
98:17 there's really good data on triangles
98:20 and so on so there are a lot of
98:22 different structures that are reported
98:25 under under good conditions and so it
98:28 isn't just one kind of thing for sure
98:32 this is a question on the bismuth
98:35 magnesium sample which is unbelievably
98:39 complicated and all over the internet
98:43 with everyone from this comes from a
98:46 well-known process of that that's known
98:50 in sucking bismuth out of magnesium with
98:57 mercury and so that kind of thing just
98:59 off of a factory floor versus claims
99:03 that this definitely did come from a
99:06 naming fresh retrieval and so on so the
99:09 answer is we don't yet really know where
99:11 it came from and it's true that ten
99:14 years ago and then to how provided us a
99:16 sample and we did a lot of tests
99:19 electron microscope pictures and
99:21 irradiated with various gigahertz
99:24 frequencies megahertz frequencies and so
99:27 on
99:28 could couldn't make any anything out of
99:30 it so it kind of went on the shelf and
99:32 there was only after this paper and
99:35 metamaterials was published we said oh
99:36 my gosh the claim here that this could
99:39 have some real utility has microscopic
99:42 waveguides it would actually fit the
99:45 structure you know that we see there ok
99:49 well where do we go with that well the
99:50 truth of matter is that piece is
99:52 actually pretty mangled and what you'd
99:55 really like to do is say okay well let's
99:56 have a nice clean piece of this and
99:59 muscle radiate with terahertz
100:00 frequencies first of all to see if it
100:02 really does act as a microscopic
100:04 waveguide for territory Qin see and then
100:07 that works oils you know irradiated with
100:10 other kinds of fields and see if there
100:12 any unexpected responses and so on so it
100:15 is still despite the fact that gets
100:17 unbelievable publicity out there it's
100:20 still absolutely unknown the DES range
100:22 all the way from this was a fraud of
100:25 junk material sent to us - no this came
100:29 off the wedge of an ET craft we don't
100:31 know the answer to that and the only way
100:35 we're going to get something about I use
100:37 to determine its properties or maybe
100:39 reproduce it under nice conditions and
100:42 determines properties so it's still a
100:44 giant question mark out there so even
100:47 though it's it's you know it's like a
100:49 few percent of our effort at TTS a it's
100:52 like 99 percent of our criticisms oh
100:55 that's just what you get in this field
100:57 it's wake-ups some of us have developed
101:01 very hard skins
101:04 a question about Ingo Swann and his
101:06 reporting of being on the moon I don't
101:10 know if it was on the on the backside or
101:12 not yeah I know detail I didn't remember
101:21 that was in the dark on the backside of
101:23 the front side or whatever while we had
101:27 it's exactly described as a book
101:29 actually while we were doing remote
101:31 viewing we're getting 20% hit rate 30%
101:35 40% 50% and one day someone has somehow
101:41 gotten into his crypto locked office and
101:43 left a note on his desk saying when you
101:46 get to 70% let us know and you let us
101:51 know by some procedure I forget what it
101:54 was and so he finally got up to that
101:56 point he did let whoever said that no
101:59 and so they showed up and said and
102:02 apparently part of some kind of black
102:04 program and said not you remote viewing
102:08 is that good we want to use your talents
102:13 to do some explorations so you know
102:15 right out of a movie you know meet him
102:18 in New York City put a bag over his head
102:20 drive around go to an underground
102:23 facility Baba Papa very military kinds
102:26 of people and they just gave him some
102:28 coordinates because by then we're doing
102:30 coordinate remote viewing realizing that
102:32 they just send somebody to a site you'd
102:35 just use coordinates explaining that's a
102:38 whole other thing but anyway and so he
102:40 was getting some descriptions and so on
102:42 they're really strange because he didn't
102:44 realize that they were coordinates on
102:46 the moon and turned out his descriptions
102:49 were matching features of the moon at
102:52 some point he said you know I might
102:55 looking at the moon and they agreed that
102:58 he was and he was actually shocked by
103:02 some of the stuff that you can read
103:04 about in the book penetration so that
103:06 was like some kind of test of whether
103:09 that could happen and he had already
103:10 shown
103:11 he had the ability to do remote
103:13 locations because before NASA's flyby of
103:17 Jupiter he found with thin rings around
103:21 Jupiter and we reported them in our book
103:23 called mind reach ahead of NASA getting
103:26 there the Carl Sagan came by our lab and
103:29 said yeah this stuff he generated it's
103:33 ridiculous that there's only stuff you
103:35 can get out of any encyclopedia
103:36 he's got rings around Jupiter I'm at
103:38 that sounds like say I don't know rings
103:39 around Jupiter and of course when they
103:41 probe actually got there there were
103:44 rings aren't you but a very thin so it's
103:46 no so he was ahead of everybody in that
103:49 so anyway these people knew about that
103:52 and so then the second thing they did is
103:55 some time later they showed up and said
104:00 we want to take you to a place up in the
104:03 north and so he didn't know where it was
104:05 Alaska Canada or whatever and they had
104:08 him there when the UFO came over or a
104:11 lake that they knew was going to come
104:12 over at a certain time how'd they know
104:14 that no and so he they wanted him to say
104:18 anything about anything you know he was
104:20 so scared he couldn't say anything
104:21 anyway the book goes on all those kind
104:23 of things he didn't know how to come to
104:29 grips of that he was even though we're
104:34 on top-secret projects he had to wait
104:37 ten years before he tell me that he
104:40 waited 12 years because he was really
104:42 afraid I'd really get mad at him for not
104:44 sharing this so when I came to my own
104:48 conclusions about you know that he was
104:50 being tested by people who already knew
104:52 the answers they just want to see if
104:54 they were vulnerable to remove yours and
104:56 he insisted no no they were trying to
104:58 get answers that they didn't know the
104:59 answers to so we never agreed on that so
105:03 anyway that's that's a long bit of
105:05 arcana about a very long story
105:09 okay's questions about that what I
105:11 raised about how everything speaks sort
105:14 of come in like compartmentalize or say
105:16 still fight there's any way to cut
105:19 through that well in the eight chip
105:22 program we were doing our best to cut
105:24 through that that's why we got all these
105:26 individual 38 papers and then made them
105:29 available to everyone and so behind the
105:33 scenes there are efforts to get people
105:35 talking to each other all of whom have
105:38 their little fiefdom and so whether
105:41 that's gonna work out I don't know the
105:43 answer to yet so we're doing her best so
105:48 the question is given that in my talk I
105:51 basically talked about Navy involvement
105:53 what about the Air Force you'd expect
105:55 the Air Force to be involved and I have
106:00 my reasons for believing the Air Force
106:01 is involved but I can't go into any
106:04 detail and and most of the what's come
106:09 out for public consumption is the Navy's
106:12 involvement so you know I just have to
106:15 stick with that I didn't quite get the
106:18 question you said it since Project Blue
106:20 Book continued and actually Project Blue
106:21 Book as that as as a named Project Blue
106:24 Book didn't continue it's just that
106:26 other programs were set up with
106:28 different names all over the place so
106:30 and what was the second party Oh his
106:33 project Stargate the remote viewing a
106:35 program continued on if it has you
106:38 wouldn't hear of it that's all I can say
106:45 the question is about the confusing
106:47 messages that come out from the Public
106:49 Affairs Office and the Pentagon who
106:51 don't have the clearances to know
106:52 exactly what's going on in a tip or
106:55 followin program you know is that clear
106:58 afrika clarification of that for example
107:01 when new Elizondo describe his position
107:05 at one point the pentagon said well we
107:09 don't know that he was involved in this
107:11 program there even was a UFO and that a
107:14 tip was involved with UFOs and and so
107:17 that caused a lot of you know problems
107:20 for elizondo's
107:22 absolute hero I could give you a list of
107:27 stuff he's done in the intelligence
107:29 world you know what a hero he was and
107:32 then they changed their mind and ridden
107:35 originally said that the videotapes of
107:39 the f18 didn't really come out of the
107:41 Pentagon or they weren't officially
107:43 approved for release then they changed
107:45 their mind say ok yeah he was in the
107:47 program and then it goes back is just
107:49 the clarification is not coming forward
107:52 very cleanly and so there's a lot of
107:57 work behind the scenes that say you know
107:59 as long as the story out there is so
108:02 confused and that might be good for some
108:05 people to get this off the radar but you
108:09 know it's not right and so T TSA and my
108:13 colleagues are doing a lot behind the
108:15 scenes speaking to people to try to
108:17 clean up so they get a nice clean
108:19 statement they finally came out with a
108:21 clean statement to say yeah these videos
108:24 are official and what's in the videos
108:27 really is unidentified so we're making
108:30 progress but there's a lot more
108:32 clarification that could and I think
108:34 will come because now that the profile
108:38 is so high they're drowning in fo ia
108:41 requests and
108:43 having to deal with them and sends them
108:46 off into the bowels of the Pentagon the
108:49 intelligence community to try to get
108:50 some answers good luck so anyway I think
108:54 in a matter of time things would get
108:55 clarified but it's really a slow process
108:58 and for the Azam guys really been
109:01 suffering and I gotta say he's repeating
109:05 a well known actually was from a
109:07 presentation that Ben rich who was head
109:11 of Lockheed Martin skunk works
109:12 he gave shortly before his death to an
109:15 engineering group at some University in
109:20 Southern California and he was talking
109:23 about all the advances in aerospace and
109:25 how he developed stealth and so on and
109:28 he's got toward the end of his set of
109:32 slides he ended up with a slide of what
109:34 looks like an ET craft taking off into
109:36 the stars and so Jan Marcin who's
109:42 actually director of MUFON actually
109:45 after the talk was over cornered him and
109:48 said well you know is this what can you
109:50 tell me do you guys really have all this
109:52 going together and and so in I guess
109:56 maybe was he even in his talk he said
109:58 you know we hadn't now had the
109:59 technology to take e.t home and so on
110:04 and so a lot of questions
110:07 in fact by me and everybody in this
110:11 field you know was he exaggerating was
110:14 he really trying to tell us something or
110:16 is he just generating interest in the
110:19 future and so whether what he was saying
110:23 you know we had the technology to take
110:25 e.t home and it's not as hard as you
110:27 would think it would be statements like
110:29 that coming from a guy who's head of the
110:31 skunk work really hard to discount it on
110:35 the other hand as we go digging for
110:36 evidence you know people's skunk works I
110:40 mean I've had contracts with Scott
110:42 Parkey let me keep digging
110:44 you really can't find out why he said
110:46 that so either it was somewhat of an
110:49 exaggerated
110:49 and just kind of a blueprint for the
110:51 future or it is so buried that even
110:55 people you who you think would know
110:58 don't know so I don't know the answer to
111:02 that question how should I take Ben
111:06 Rich's comments seriously or not
111:09 I just keep digging on the off chance
111:12 that he might have been telling it like
111:14 it is but you know until nice find data
111:18 or my colleagues find data it's just
111:22 again just one of those things in the
111:24 gray box oh they are looking like mad at
111:35 the whole subject area just like we are
111:36 I think I showed one slide which was the
111:41 1991 report that's that thick of all the
111:46 things they were trying to figure out I
111:48 mean both the US and the Russians have a
111:51 similar problem and that is that UFOs
111:55 have come over our nuclear missile silos
111:59 and turned them off
112:03 so that we can't launch well it turns
112:07 out there's a case in Russia which is
112:08 even worse than that UFO came over and
112:11 the missile silo got turned on and
112:14 started the launch code sequence and
112:17 they couldn't they couldn't turn it off
112:20 they couldn't control it they thought
112:23 they were about ready to start World War
112:24 three and when he got up to sort of the
112:27 last element of the launch it stopped
112:30 they took that thing apart not my boat
112:34 to try to figure out how could this
112:35 could even happen in principle and you
112:38 know similarly in our case all the
112:42 contractors a bill to hold the control
112:44 equipment or called in figure out how
112:46 this could even happen in principle so
112:49 yes the Russians are concerned just like
112:51 we're concerned because they're
112:52 gathering data just like we're gathering
112:55 data they have evidence just like we
112:57 have evidence they have their teams
112:59 there a tip teams just like we have our
113:01 a tip teams so they have less openness I
113:07 mean TTS a is really kind of out in the
113:09 front of being relatively open about
113:11 what's going on I have not seen that and
113:15 so but you can be sure that they're
113:18 involved just as we're involved and this
113:23 is a question about something you've
113:24 been floating around on the internet
113:26 about something magical happening in in
113:31 Antarctica Senator Kerry went to
113:35 investigate it and other things some
113:38 astronauts and so on I've not been able
113:41 to tell I don't have any evidence I
113:42 don't have any opinion because I base my
113:45 opinions only in what I can verify and
113:48 so I've not seen any actual evidence of
113:51 some strange et or not C or whatever
113:55 thing going on in Antarctica so to me I
113:59 in my file about conspiracy theories
114:02 that that I'm not accepting as as we're
114:05 spending any time thinking about I don't
114:08 actually have any data so I don't have
114:10 an opinion I only follow the data this
114:15 is a question about the Wilson documents
114:18 that finally got leaked on the Internet
114:20 Edmund Wilson who was one of the Joint
114:24 Chiefs of Staff interview by my senior
114:28 scientist colleague Eric Davis since it
114:32 discusses potentially ongoing programs I
114:36 have no comment this is a question about
114:42 discussion in fact I guess I even
114:45 mentioned it on an interview with George
114:46 Knapp about a document leaking that
114:52 verified that there were in fact crash
114:55 retrievals I know it's out there on the
115:00 internet someplace I'm not sure where
115:03 and so I don't know where you could go
115:07 look for it
115:12 and the question was when they when I
115:16 had Richard Doty as a consult and you
115:20 know some years ago was that part of the
115:21 ATF program no this was on another
115:24 program before a tip this is a question
115:27 about Dan Sherman's book or just called
115:31 above black or something like that about
115:34 his experiences being involved with ET
115:38 communication and as part of a
115:40 super-secret program and so on I don't
115:43 have any evidence for it I don't have
115:45 any opinion for of it some of what was
115:50 described and quite gel with things I
115:53 knew about in the general quote psychic
115:57 realm of government investigation so
116:01 I've been kind of skeptical but you know
116:03 can I say for sure and I for sure was
116:06 there something to that I have no way of
116:08 judging her question has to do with the
116:11 fact that mentioned under the ultra
116:13 terrestrial hypothesis that I had formed
116:16 that you know maybe maybe there's some
116:19 group out there that in fact has been
116:21 successful in reverse engineering or
116:24 even inventing from scratch those kinds
116:28 of exotic craft well that's got to be on
116:31 the table as an option as a possibility
116:34 my point and bringing it up in that
116:37 paper was say okay well if that's a
116:38 possibility what would be the clues that
116:41 we could find out there you know I mean
116:44 if somebody's building really magical
116:46 craft they still have to order their
116:47 nuts and bolts from Home Depot or
116:49 something you know it should be possible
116:51 to follow some lines and so on so that
116:55 was that was an example one example
116:58 though okay if that's an option that's
117:00 possibility how would we be able to find
117:03 out what investigatory tools who use
117:06 what paths should we follow to see if we
117:10 can find evidence for that I can't rule
117:12 out the possibility that you know some
117:15 terrestrial or organization who knows
117:19 back in the Middle Ages accidentally
117:23 just you know discovered antigravity
117:25 airs
117:26 thing and now they're off in some you
117:30 know mountain hideout and the Himalayas
117:33 or something building these craft so you
117:35 can't you can't I'm not ready to rule
117:38 out anything also I want you to know
117:40 that you know that sounds like my mind
117:42 is so open my brains are falling out the
117:44 truth the matter is I know I'm I'm very
117:47 skeptical I don't because just knowing
117:50 the physics I can't imagine that
117:52 somebody has done that purely ground up
117:57 and I have yet to see evidence in the
118:01 official literature that I'm exposed to
118:03 even at high levels that successful
118:07 reverse engineering has occurred so all
118:10 that just stays in my gray box at this
118:12 point well this is a question about one
118:16 of the things that floating out and I
118:17 think I even know the program you're
118:19 talking about that Nixon left some
118:22 secret document when he left talking
118:26 about UFOs or ETS or what he knew or
118:28 whatever and that document has not been
118:30 found could remote viewers be used to
118:34 find the document and so on I don't know
118:37 what to make of that whether there's any
118:40 validity to the story generally speaking
118:44 it's difficult for remote viewers to
118:46 find hidden things you can give the
118:49 coordinates and they can get there but
118:51 it's like they were dropped in on the
118:53 parachute and they had no idea where
118:54 they are but when you do it the other
118:56 way and that is will tell you exactly
118:58 what's looking for can you find us
119:02 that's a much tougher tougher Avenue
119:05 with remote knowing it has worked in
119:08 fact Jimmy Carter revealed a result that
119:13 we thought we were told would never be
119:14 revealed and that is a Soviet plane was
119:19 being flown out of
119:24 lívia to be turned over to us and
119:29 phenomena the pilot got cold feet he
119:31 said well you know KGB's gonna hunt me
119:34 down the rest of my life sweets just
119:36 bailed out yes I changed his mind and
119:38 let it crash somewhere in Africa
119:40 somewhere in Africa when I ran out of
119:43 fill and nobody could find it with
119:46 satellites because it crashed in the
119:48 jungle canopy likely and so the
119:51 satellites couldn't find it so when
119:53 things get really tough Stan Turner who
119:55 is Carter's head of CIA came to us I
120:00 said can your quote remote viewers find
120:03 this plane we want to find it before the
120:05 Russians do and so we put two of our
120:08 best remote viewers on it one from the
120:09 Air Force one from our own SSRI and they
120:13 described where it was and put an X on a
120:16 map which was in two miles and this is
120:19 over hundreds of thousands of square
120:21 miles on a map within two miles of where
120:24 the plane was in the jungle so the CIA
120:27 folks could run in and get the plane
120:29 which we got and so that was a case of
120:32 successful finding something that was
120:35 hidden we were told that that would
120:37 never be revealed but then after Carter
120:41 was out of office he was talking to a
120:42 group and at a university in Georgia and
120:48 somebody said what do you think it's
120:49 kind of weird and strange happened while
120:51 you were president said yeah you know
120:53 Soviet bomber went down in Africa turn
120:57 to psychics to pregnant and he's
121:00 actually his his there's a videotaped
121:03 interview of him actually describing
121:05 that event so but anyway finding stuff
121:08 especially you wanna use your resource
121:10 to find something that just comes out of
121:13 a conspiracy theory may not even be true
121:15 you know if you just don't go there
121:17 Thanks
121:20 [Applause]
121:25 all right I hope I have one more final
121:31 question for the last time I heard your
121:35 name on the Internet
121:38 Steven Greer was pitching his movie
121:42 that's coming out and he said that you
121:46 had told him that there were some anti
121:51 gravity or anti energy anti energy
121:56 devices or something and he had asked
121:59 you why didn't make them public and you
122:03 said that they would murder your kids
122:07 and your wife and probably you if if you
122:12 said why did you say that I didn't say
122:15 that I didn't say that most of I mean it
122:21 really really ruins my appreciation for
122:25 the media in general because most times
122:27 when I find something in there about me
122:29 it's not true so I wonder what is that
122:33 the case with everything I'm reading
122:35 error in anyway no I did not tell a
122:37 Greer Steve prayer that if anything were
122:41 released if I were to release anything I
122:45 and my family would be murdered never
122:47 said it never even thought it thanks for
122:52 clearing that up
122:53 [Applause] 

==========LTZr1lRbIUI==========

00:01 hey it's Marty and Danielle and we've
00:05 got Tom DeLonge of Angels and Airwaves
00:07 with this in a zoom digital space where
00:12 we get to be looking like we're on ESPN
00:14 talking sports but we're talking music
00:16 as that it is very sports like of us
00:19 yeah a track jacket so I tell him you
00:26 hit us with a brand new song so cool
00:29 tell us why you came fast and furious
00:31 with this song I think it's to help
00:33 people get some food yeah well okay so
00:36 I've been recording this Angels and
00:38 Airwaves album for over a year and all
00:41 that was left on this particular left
00:44 which is funny because the song is all
00:45 that's left is not a chord on the song
00:48 or the where the the vocals the lyrics
00:51 and I just thought at the moment it
00:54 happened when the world was kind of
00:56 really and what the most fearful period
00:58 which is that first week when it was
01:00 Russian grocery stores and all over so
01:01 like this is weird
01:02 and this is scary we don't really know
01:04 it's gonna come out of this I I was
01:07 struck kinda by public consciousness
01:11 because there's there's a lot of studies
01:13 that have been done and a lot within the
01:15 US government as well that I'm aware of
01:17 but that that your mind this remind over
01:22 matter that saying is very true where
01:24 they found and I actually have a really
01:27 amazing sensitive document that and I'd
01:30 always tell people about this where they
01:31 actually were as part of the UFO program
01:33 at the Pentagon they were following this
01:35 kid in China that can move objects with
01:37 his mind and he was like 10 years old
01:39 why yeah so they repeated the experiment
01:43 in the Department of Defense and they
01:46 put a piece of paper in a glass mason
01:47 jar and they screwed the lid on it with
01:49 their mind they moved the paper through
01:50 the lid of the jar six feet across the
01:52 floor and it says right there in the
01:55 document the letter had and everything
01:56 on our defense
01:58 you know it's they found that it's a
02:00 hundred percent of people can do it but
02:02 only 10% of the people can really like
02:03 master it and my point being is that you
02:07 know the your mindset that you're in it
02:10 affects all matter around you and I can
02:12 give you another couple laboratory
02:14 Spearman's but we can put down our
02:15 alcohol but they prove that
02:17 consciousness effect all matter around
02:20 you in terms of healing they've been
02:22 healed but it's like 30 mice with like
02:25 crazy terminal cancers they healed all
02:27 the mice with just energy healing in a
02:29 way I was a wonderful lecture I listened
02:32 to but I was thinking when everyone was
02:34 really scared with the virus you have
02:36 mass consciousness but for something
02:37 that's negative fear and that's a really
02:39 bad place to be because it's gonna
02:41 perpetuate things you know in a negative
02:44 way so I was like well maybe my little
02:46 part you know put out something more
02:48 hopeful or more optimistic and so it
02:51 started then and then we were able to
02:53 release it today and - and and the other
02:57 thing is about this is feeding America
02:59 San Diego is a group that I've worked
03:02 with for years I've done things like
03:03 hand out food to underplay the school
03:06 kids at schools I have handed out food
03:08 to people that were on in in kind of
03:11 situations dealers of poverty or health
03:14 or something that kind of kept them from
03:16 being able to have access to warm meals
03:18 done that holidays and all you know so I
03:20 and I've done syrup into certain
03:23 functions with them like fundraising
03:26 events with feeding America and so I
03:29 just thought what a wonderful
03:31 organization for right now for so many
03:33 people losing their jobs have no money
03:35 to go to the grocery store a lot of
03:37 these kids they're only warm meal was
03:40 death school and schools are closed you
03:41 know so the whole thing kind of worked
03:43 out really symbiotically and it was very
03:46 organic to do something positive and to
03:49 hope and to raise money for an
03:50 organization I believe in that I worked
03:52 with but also right now is more
03:54 important than ever and beyond the song
03:56 did I also see that there's a t-shirt
03:59 that is out as well for this there
04:01 probably is I I only say that because
04:05 I've been so concentrating on so
04:07 strongly on like the music part of it I
04:10 I know that the team put together how
04:12 it's gonna raise money and where and I
04:14 don't know all the details of that but
04:15 normally what we do is we add a t-shirt
04:19 or something to be involved with a
04:20 limited edition and try to do something
04:22 kind of cool and it helps us raise more
04:24 money for the cause so well so let me
04:26 tell you about this
04:27 Tom so you've come out with a really
04:29 cool shirt an Angels and Airwaves shirt
04:31 and one from it is benefiting a feeding
04:34 Sam who though it is up on the website
04:35 for Angels and Airwaves in your store
04:37 it's a really cool shirt too like if
04:40 your hand you're gonna dig it three
04:42 quick questions for you biggest fashion
04:45 regret over the years Tom you've been at
04:46 it through I just asked your grant so
04:50 really my biggest fan we got would have
04:52 been in high school where I had no idea
04:55 that I could have gone down to Walmart
04:58 and bought white t-shirts and Dickie's
05:00 and I felt so cool different lover the
05:04 white t-shirts and Dickie's thing until
05:06 blink started and we're wearing it
05:07 everyday you know and obviously people
05:10 can look at the old blink photos the big
05:12 Dickie shorts in the sideways hats and
05:14 stuff just a good pair of Dickies pants
05:17 in a Hanes white t-shirt from Walmart
05:20 it's a great look and like I would have
05:22 knew that that I was cool in high school
05:24 I would have been like I would have
05:27 looked been so much cooler than I was
05:29 piecing together weird that we
05:31 didn't have money for at my house so
05:33 it's like hand-me-downs and like Kmart
05:36 clothing and stuff you know yeah what
05:38 about that gift of you doing wth how's
05:41 that sit in your life WTF yeah yeah yes
05:49 you love it right you got to yes I knew
05:53 what they have one where you know he did
05:57 the symptom it merged it with The
05:58 Simpsons guy what disappears into the
06:00 hedge have worn when he put the glasses
06:02 where it looks like the matrix
06:03 yes you know with the lumbers I think
06:05 it's so fun yes and we we've been
06:07 putting out a lot of boomer merchandise
06:09 lately um we brought back a whole bunch
06:12 of so that character's name is boomer
06:13 it's from an old blink-182 video for a
06:15 song called first date where we're all
06:17 dressed up it came from I came from
06:19 watching a documentary on the Bee Gees
06:20 and I call that mark I was like dude you
06:22 gotta wash your these dudes are on
06:23 top of her mouth with the whole hair
06:25 singing last question when you see this
06:32 what do you think it has the first
06:34 feeling is this the good physically yeah
06:36 technically the second album of Angel
06:38 blinks are not angels of Blake and
06:41 what's funny about it is called Cheshire
06:43 cat so just shows you how much we know
06:46 is this people think it's the first
06:48 record we had some demos out before that
06:50 we just called Buddha but when we did
06:55 that Cheshire Cat album the guy that
06:57 that put it out on the record label made
07:00 a bet with his son because the son was
07:02 the one that wanted to sign us he made a
07:05 bet with the son that we wouldn't sell
07:06 more than 3000 copies he hated it you
07:08 know and and then it went really big you
07:11 know probably sold millions by now or
07:13 something
07:13 but I remember not only after that been
07:16 we signed to a major label with dude
07:19 ranch and we go to MCA records which is
07:22 Universal Music Group big major label at
07:24 the time and they brought all the people
07:26 from all the divisions to a lobby to
07:28 play Deuter at the new record and they
07:31 put it on it everyone's have a drinks
07:33 and cake and it's like a party a blank
07:34 is blocking your first big major label
07:37 debut they put on the first song in
07:39 about 45 seconds into that song they all
07:42 left every single person that they all
07:44 hate at the band they all thought it was
07:46 just like noise you know and then we
07:48 were left and we're sitting there with
07:49 the one guy that signed us and we're go
07:50 well we could have signed to epitaph you
07:53 know hit the tigers epitaph which a big
07:55 punk label on where all of our friends
07:57 were at like rancid and offspring and
07:59 Pennywise less you know we were like we
08:03 should maybe we should have gone there
08:04 you know cuz they don't get us but it
08:06 worked you know and uh and then later
08:08 once the band's big all the people come
08:10 to all we always loved you yeah you're
08:11 okay yeah yeah always
08:14 carving our own path but Cheshire cat
08:16 was the cat I was delivering concrete I
08:19 strut his truck and deliver these big
08:21 bags of concrete and some dude probably
08:25 someone from another country or
08:26 something was knocking door-to-door at
08:27 an industrial park selling calendars
08:29 with pictures of cats in it and right
08:33 and I showed mark mother this cat with
08:34 blue eyes and he's all I love Cheshire
08:36 Cat or something I don't know how it all
08:38 work but I look at that it's like the
08:40 worst album cover ever the best thing
08:42 about that album covers if you turn it
08:43 over my friend is in a box with little
08:45 arms and legs of the knife row
08:48 the best part of the album cover yeah
08:51 all that's left is love is the new song
08:53 Khmer Angels and Airwaves thanks for
08:54 dropping it on 91x today the world is
08:56 going to come around and thanks to you
08:58 and the rest of the group for feeding
09:00 Sandiego the food bank here and all that
09:02 you're doing for people in this very
09:04 tough time Tom DeLonge of Angels &
09:06 Airwaves and cheese we didn't get into
09:08 the many other things you do in your
09:13 racer by the way oh there you go love
09:18 from all over bro thanks for song thank

00:24 Were you involved with a tip?
00:26 Yes, I was in what?
00:29 In what respect were you involved
00:30 with a tip as a consultant?
00:35 The IRS program was where
00:37 I was actually a subcontractor as
00:39 an employee here.
00:40 We were a subcontractor to big low
00:43 aerospace advance based studies, be
00:45 a SS on
00:47 the ISAF, which was the other
00:49 side of a tip.
00:50 A tip was handled out of the office
00:52 of the undersecretary of Defense for
00:54 Intelligence, and ASKAP
00:56 was at the Defense Intelligence
00:57 Agency.
00:58 And that's the actual funded program
01:00 that received enough congressional
01:03 appropriation to hire outside
01:04 contractors like Bass
01:06 and Urtext to work on the programs.
01:09 OK, so you you
01:11 you all you ultimately worked
01:13 for were part of
01:16 the Pentagon's UFO program.
01:18 Yeah.
01:20 What kind of what kind of stuff did
01:22 you do for the Pentagon UFO program?
01:25 Oh, basically
01:27 what I just discussed was
01:29 we we had.
01:30 Well, first of all, we gave
01:31 technical advice to the field
01:33 investigation. We'd get information
01:35 and data on reports and
01:37 we would do physics analysis and
01:40 report back on what we what our
01:41 opinion or assessments on the field.
01:43 Investigations and data was
01:45 on variety of observations and
01:46 encounters of UFO phenomena.
01:48 But one big main part
01:50 of our work was to hire
01:53 38 independent
01:55 expert scientists
01:57 in industry, academia and government
02:00 to write defense
02:02 intelligence reference documents on
02:05 future transformation concepts
02:08 for concepts that we can envision
02:10 in the year 2050.
02:12 And take what we have in our
02:14 existing really advanced physics
02:15 and really advanced aerospace
02:18 technology and evolve it
02:20 to the future 2050 and see what
02:21 it looks like and see if we can
02:23 compare.
02:24 See if we have any hopes of
02:26 of developing an advanced technology
02:28 in 2050 that's comparable
02:30 to the Tic-Tac
02:32 UFOs that the USS Nimitz and
02:34 Roosevelt encountered.
02:35 And the other type of UFO is at the
02:37 other naval warships have
02:39 encountered out in the Middle East
02:40 and elsewhere around the
02:43 around the Pacific and Atlantic.
02:45 OK. So you said that part of your
02:47 job at all set.
02:48 Right. All set us
02:50 out. So that was you would get
02:52 reports and you guys
02:54 would study and analyze the physics
02:56 behind those reports.
02:58 What kind of reports are you talking
02:59 about?
03:01 One was the least.
03:02 One was a Navy laser weapon report
03:04 about the development of the
03:05 breakthroughs in Solid-State laser
03:07 weapon technology.
03:08 Another one was a paper I coauthored
03:10 as a second author on extra space
03:13 dimensional warp drive.
03:14 So the lead author got his p.g in
03:16 physics at Baylor University in
03:17 Waco, Texas, on
03:19 looking at extra space dimensions
03:21 and drawing on vacuum energy,
03:23 quantum vacuum energy from the extra
03:24 dimensions to power warp drive.
03:27 So we coauthored a paper that I
03:28 coauthored. I wrote as a single
03:30 author, a paper on traversable
03:32 wormholes.
03:33 And then I wrote a paper
03:35 on
03:37 how to explore
03:39 the quantum vacuum to
03:41 produce negative vacuum energy that
03:43 creates that you would need to
03:44 create a wormhole and work drive.
03:47 And then I authored a paper
03:49 on anti-gravity propulsion physics
03:50 using generativity because
03:52 all that is all wrapped up into the
03:53 same physics.
03:55 Other people talked about smart
03:57 materials, nano materials,
04:00 MHC aerospace propulsion
04:02 systems, hypersonic
04:04 propulsion,
04:07 invisibility cloaks, using
04:09 metamaterials,
04:10 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
04:12 There were 38 reports.
04:13 I don't have the list of I have them
04:15 that I have. I don't have all of
04:16 them. Only a few, I think, were
04:17 released. But I have the one on
04:19 traversable wormholes.
04:22 OK, one quick thing
04:24 about Allsopp.
04:25 So how long
04:27 did you work with Allsopp?
04:29 Five years from 2007 to 2012,
04:32 and then it was shut down, right?
04:34 Yeah, because we couldn't get.
04:36 We couldn't. The DEA
04:38 director and executive director were
04:40 against renewing it for another
04:42 five years.
04:43 So they're supposed to get another
04:45 five year appropriation from the
04:46 Senate through the defense
04:49 appropriations bill.
04:50 But they turned it down because they
04:52 were not given enough complete
04:54 information, understand, with the
04:55 full scope of the program was
04:57 and the reason for that is we were
04:59 not sure that they would be accepted
05:01 or receptive of this
05:03 type of program.
05:04 So they were only briefed on
05:05 superficial aspects of the program
05:08 that they misconstrued to be
05:10 a waste of money or just,
05:12 you know, unexplained.
05:13 Why are we putting that kind of
05:14 money into something that got
05:16 138 technical papers come out of it
05:18 while there's was much more than 30 05:19 technical papers?
05:20 And and the problem is, is
05:22 that you have a problem with a
05:25 very biased, closed minds where the
05:27 UFO subject concern, especially
05:29 if you've got military and civilian
05:30 leadership that have been raised
05:33 and educated as evangelical
05:35 Christians or other religious
05:37 or other religious
05:39 cults or whatnot, where
05:41 they object to UFO is being
05:43 set. Canik tone.
05:44 And got it.
05:46 You know,
05:48 nothing that you worked on, though,
05:50 during those five years was
05:52 considered top secret.
05:53 Correct.
05:54 It was it was top secret FCI.
05:57 It was T.S. FCI sensitive,
05:59 compartmentalized information.
06:01 So the DOT s it was a
06:03 slash FCI.
06:04 So the documents I have in my
06:06 possession, 38 06:09 reports are classified except
06:11 for the laser weapon one, which is
06:13 now that particular
06:15 report is now.
06:16 I think it got unclassified because
06:18 or declassified because the
06:19 technology is now old and out of
06:21 date. It's been replaced by more
06:23 recent Solid-State weapon technology
06:25 that the report.
06:26 Well, that that report was basically
06:28 a survey of the existing
06:30 state of the art of Solid-State
06:32 laser weapons at the Navy
06:34 and other elements of the DSD have
06:35 been developing and deploying for
06:37 testing.
06:38 OK, so that paper's now opening
06:40 with all the other papers.
06:42 Of course, they were unclassified,
06:43 but that's the nature of those
06:45 papers. We wanted the authors
06:47 of those papers to be allowed to
06:48 publish those papers in the peer
06:50 reviewed journals that
06:52 correspond to their professional
06:53 discipline.
06:54 So we deliberately
06:56 wanted those papers to be
06:57 unclassified so that the authors
06:59 can publish those. In fact, my
07:02 boss. How put off had already
07:03 published his limit that
07:06 he had already published his time
07:07 metric engineering paper in the
07:09 Journal of the British
07:09 Interplanetary Society
07:11 during the asset program.
07:13 But before his DARPA
07:15 got published by the DEA.
07:17 My my paper
07:19 on warp drives, wormholes and
07:21 negative vacuum energy that the
07:23 quantum tomography of looking at
07:25 negative vacuum energy in a variety
07:27 of squee state systems
07:29 that didn't get published until
07:32 2013 in the Journal of the British
07:34 Interplanetary Society.
07:35 It was also a paper that I presented
07:38 as in the in the 20 07:40 and the 2011 07:42 DARPA, NASA 100 year Starship
07:44 Symposium in Tampa in
07:46 Orlando, Florida.
07:48 And that that was in September,
07:50 the end of September 2011.
07:52 So I presented that DARPA
07:54 paper as a symposium and
07:56 proceedings.
07:57 That symposium proceedings was being
07:58 published along with the others by
08:00 Jabe is the Journal of
08:02 the British Interplanetary Society
08:03 after they underwent the usual
08:05 peer review process for acceptance.
08:07 Where was all seven eight?
08:09 To date coexist at the same
08:11 time.
08:12 Pretty much all atrip came before
08:14 Orsa because of the Nemitz
08:15 encounter. So almost, almost
08:17 simultaneously, a tip came a little
08:19 bit before, but they coordinated and
08:21 they both ended in 2012.
08:24 No, no.
08:25 A tip never ended.
08:28 A tip never ended.
08:29 No.
08:31 It's still going on today.
08:33 Yeah.
08:35 Who runs it?
08:36 Not me.
08:37 They changed the name, changed
08:39 names, changed location, changed
08:41 leadership.
08:41 So what did was on.
08:43 What's the new name?
08:45 I can't tell you, though.
08:48 You said the reason you know
08:49 this is because you are still
08:52 on the inside.
08:53 Oh, I'm I'm a consultant still.
08:55 Yeah.
08:56 You are still insulting.
08:58 You are still a consultant for
09:00 the program, formerly known as
09:02 a tip.
09:02 Correct.
09:04 And you're saying it's it's
09:06 been renamed.
09:07 It still exists and it's
09:09 still being run out of USDA.
09:12 I won't confirm where it's been run
09:14 out of, but generally an
09:16 intelligence program.
09:17 Yeah. You know.
09:19 Yeah, I mean, maybe I am confirming
09:21 yelped up generally oh, issue.
09:23 Oh. Oh, USDA.
09:24 Yeah, it it
09:26 isn't likely to change locations for
09:28 any reason because of the way
09:30 the DOJ
09:32 is organized.
09:33 This is not a this is this
09:35 is an intelligence operation to
09:37 gather data, analyze it, evaluated
09:39 and and recommend courses of action.
09:41 So that falls into the intelligence
09:44 area.
09:45 I got I got a quote from the DOJ
09:47 D.
09:49 That said that a tip did
09:51 investigate and research
09:53 unidentified aerial phenomenon.
09:57 Does it still investigate?
10:00 Unidentified aerial phenomenon?
10:02 Yes.
10:04 Confirm that a tip is still going.
10:06 It's still owned by the, oh USD
10:08 guy. It's under a new name and
10:10 that's under new management.
10:12 That's about all I can say about it,
10:14 because you are still under
10:15 contract, right?
10:17 No, there's no contract.
10:18 It's an informing consulting right
10:19 now because they don't have
10:22 an appropriation to fund external
10:24 contractors. So I'm I may
10:26 unofficial. I'm just a consultant
10:28 and I'm not getting paid to do it.
10:29 It's just what happens.
10:33 But you have signed some kind of
10:35 NDA, correct?
10:37 No, don't need to.
10:38 I had security clearances.
10:41 OK.
10:42 And I've got a history in this
10:44 business going back to 1996,
10:45 so the all of the
10:47 the program director knows
10:50 me very well.
10:51 He knows my boss very well.
10:52 He knows my former boss very well.
10:54 So if you are not contracted
10:57 nor why can't you reveal
10:59 the name of the program?
11:01 Well, because I still have
11:03 security clearances on the record.
11:05 So, you know, I wonder, under those
11:06 conditions is still we
11:08 were still patriotic Americans.
11:09 We don't like to talk about
11:10 sensitive stuff even
11:12 if we don't have a contract.
11:14 OK.
11:16 It's the rules of the road over
11:17 there. You know, we have some
11:18 informal, informal rules.
11:20 Why would the Pentagon say that
11:21 efficiently to the press?
11:23 Why would the Pentagon say that a
11:24 tip was shut down?
11:28 Let me tell you something about the
11:29 Pentagon.
11:31 It is not true that the public
11:33 relations office knows everything
11:34 that's going on, especially if it's
11:36 a classified program.
11:37 There's no automatic procedure by
11:39 which they are briefed on everything
11:41 there. They don't receive it from
11:43 there. They'd be flooded with
11:44 information that they don't know
11:45 what to do with.
11:46 So basically, they would
11:48 have to find out about something
11:50 after the fact in order to make a
11:52 public comment about it.
11:53 They are they don't know what the
11:54 let's say let's say they're the
11:55 right hand. They don't know what the
11:57 left hand is doing.
11:58 And that's how they. That's how your
11:59 government operates.
12:00 That's how the Pentagon operates.
12:01 When they said that statement, they
12:03 were only slightly to correct the
12:05 H by that mean no longer
12:07 exist.
12:08 But the but as an organization
12:10 under new leadership, it does exist
12:12 with a new name.
12:14 So that statement is incorrect.
12:16 And that's not because somebody is
12:17 lying. It's because they simply
12:19 don't know the answer.
12:20 And they did not know who to ask to
12:22 get that answer, to get that
12:23 information from.
12:24 All right. When when they came out
12:26 and said that Lewis Elizondo
12:28 had nothing to do with a tip
12:30 whatsoever, the Pentagon, it
12:32 was horrible, wrong
12:34 place of public relations.
12:36 That was absolutely incorrect.
12:38 They did not know what they were
12:39 talking about.
12:41 My boss went to report to Lou
12:43 at the Pentagon and the YO USDA
12:45 offices during the atypia
12:47 era.
12:48 So that's, you know, who my boss is,
12:50 how put off, right?
12:51 Doctor, help it off.
12:53 Right. So your boss reported
12:55 to little.
12:56 Yeah.
12:58 And I've been over there, too.
12:59 I didn't report to Lou.
13:00 I wasn't involved with Lou at that
13:02 time, but I'd been I'd been involved
13:04 with the new management.
13:06 So are you.
13:07 Are you guys still
13:09 investigating UFOs at the Pentagon?
13:13 Yeah, I would say yeah.
13:16 Course, they've they never
13:17 went away.
13:19 They never went away, Steve.
13:20 They're still there.
13:21 They're still coming up and causing
13:23 aviation havoc.
13:25 They're getting in the middle of
13:26 military aviators
13:29 operations.
13:30 And that's dangerous.
13:31 That's dangerous for those pilots.
13:32 I'm gonna ask one more time.
13:34 Sure.
13:35 Could you at least give me a clue
13:37 nugget breadcrumb about the
13:39 current eight to anything?
13:43 That's about all I have for you.
13:44 All right.
13:45 I think that's about it.
13:46 I try like Bel Air.
13:47 Yeah. Okay.
13:49 That's about it.
13:50 All right. Thank you so much.
13:52 Take care. Bye bye. 

==========41TJGAkZCu0==========

00:00 Unknown: What I would say to people who are skeptical about
00:02 this is that verifiably all around the world, a number of
00:07 different governments are putting an awful lot of
00:10 resources into this. We know of course, now a little bit about
00:15 what the United States has done. All these different governments
00:19 wouldn't be looking at this if it was just pie in the sky.
00:24 Clearly, there's no smoke without fire here.
00:36 Videotapes that have been released, they came right out
00:38 and stated, these are legitimate tapes. These are not fakes. And
00:43 we don't understand what the phenomenon is. The UK's Ministry
00:47 of Defence where I worked, we have now declassified and
00:51 released most of our UAP files. UAP is the new term for what
00:57 used to be called UFOs. UAP stands for unidentified aerial
01:03 phenomena. The reason for the change was to try to lose the
01:08 pop culture baggage that had attached itself to the term
01:13 UFOs, which just conjures up images of sci-fi movies, and it
01:17 was an attempt to reframe the debate about the topic. Not
01:22 really with the media and the public. But within government.
01:26 One of the concerns, of course, for keeping things secret is
01:29 that, as I say, we're concerned about what about some adversary
01:33 who may be making some progress, just like we're making some
01:37 progress, understanding the technology or whatever. And if
01:41 we happen to come forth with what we had learned, we might
01:44 provide some clue that would help them get over some speed
01:48 bumps they had in developing their technology. But part of
01:51 the problem with that is that with all the stovepiping and and
01:55 compartmentalization progress is very slow. In December 2017. It
02:02 turned out the new york times with some really good reporters
02:06 dug into this and suddenly found that there was an ongoing
02:09 program called ATIP, advanced aerospace threat identification
02:16 program, which in fact was the Pentagon's one of guns UAP
02:21 programs. That was the program because of my quantum background
02:26 and my general relativity, spacetime metric engineering
02:30 background. I got pulled into some years ago and asked to be a
02:35 senior advisor and the contractor. And so that's how I
02:40 got involved. These days our instrumentation has gotten so
02:47 sophisticated, that during this fleet operation, you had several
02:51 ships. You had exquisite radars onboard the ships at F-18 02:59 pilots. data was coming in as these objects flew over the
03:05 scene, showing up on radars. And so here we had these excellent
03:10 sightings recorded on, including infrared, which meant, if there
03:16 were any propulsive gases coming out the back that would have
03:19 really shown up in infrared, no sign of anything like that. No
03:23 sign of anything like wings, tails, any kind of airlift. So
03:29 really, it was it was clearly
03:31 an anomalous kind of object. One
03:33 other important aspect of UAP research for the future is going
03:38 to be artificial intelligence. And I think if we look at areas
03:44 like AI, big data, algorithms and such like what we should be
03:50 able to do is not just investigate UAP on a case by
03:56 case basis, but go back into the mentality databases and do some
04:02 trend analysis. And it may be that only when we look at the
04:08 picture holistically, combining information that we already have
04:12 across a range of different databases, some in government,
04:16 some in the private sector, that we might be able to spot
04:19 patterns that would be useful in giving us perhaps answers as to
04:25 what it is we're dealing with
04:27 here. One of the platforms we have going forward is okay, we
04:32 think we understand something about what technology is
04:36 involved. We call it space time metric engineering, space time
04:40 metric being you know, Einsteinian kind of phrase. And
04:45 despite what we casually hear, well, you can't beat the speed
04:51 of light or you can't get rid of mass and all that kind of stuff.
04:55 In general relativity, you can do that. I mean, they're
04:58 actually physics based papers published in physics journals on
05:02 warp drive, and on wormholes. That all comes out of general
05:07 relativity. So, that's the good news. Got the list of what we
05:13 think maybe some of the technology is based on. The ba
05:17 news so far as when we say okay wel
05:21 what would it take for us to do that? We it would
05:24 very compact spaces that we can't engineer yet, so we're not
05:28 ready to duplicate it.

01:08 i'm pushing november to november i know
01:11 so many of you are exhausted and tired
01:14 of politics me too sometimes because
01:17 there are bigger things
01:18 in this world than that and one of them
01:22 is about the pentagon's program and i
01:24 know many of you out there have seen the
01:26 new york times story
01:27 talking about the pentagon's program to
01:29 study um
01:31 unidentified aerial phenomenon or
01:34 unidentified flying
01:35 objects as many of us know it sounds
01:38 so far out there it sounds like science
01:40 fiction but look folks we live in a
01:42 world that's
01:43 completely upside down right now nothing
01:46 sounds crazy to me
01:47 and especially this this is a topic
01:50 that could change all of human history
01:53 it is the most
01:54 important topic right now i believe
01:58 in our present modern world and
02:02 we've seen shows about this you know
02:04 coming out trickling out
02:06 and a lot of that had to do with a man
02:07 that is going to be on the show his name
02:09 is lou elizado
02:10 he is an incredible human being as a
02:12 former military intelligence
02:14 official and a special agent in charge
02:16 but before i even
02:17 get to him and the pentagon's program
02:21 i want to know if you guys feel like

04:04 that's simply safe.com carter go there
04:07 now as we go on we're going to be
04:10 talking about
04:11 a subject that for so many people can be
04:14 very uncomfortable
04:15 you know people don't want to go out
04:16 there they don't want to put themselves
04:17 on the line i understand
04:19 but we're living in a different world
04:20 now we live in a world where we have
04:22 technologies
04:23 that are able to capture and record
04:26 phenomena that before
04:28 maybe people talked about and nobody
04:30 else believed right
04:31 they thought as this person lost their
04:32 minds or this can't be true
04:34 or you know the government finds a way
04:36 to cover it up and calls it a weather
04:38 balloon whatever you know
04:39 i want to go back to the roswell
04:41 incident um
04:43 but now we have technology and we have
04:45 capabilities that we
04:47 never had before and we are able to
04:49 record
04:51 these phenomenas for the most part and
04:54 we have
04:55 and this is the reason why the new york
04:57 times
04:58 not that i believe everything the new
04:59 york times wrote because my gosh i'm
05:02 i broke a ton of stories on the russia
05:04 hoax and they were wrong on it
05:06 but this story this story is verified
05:09 that there was and there is a department
05:12 at the pentagon that is monitoring what
05:15 they call unidentified aerial phenomena
05:17 lou elizado led that
05:20 department inside the pentagon he is not
05:23 there now
05:24 he he moved on he still holds a very
05:26 high level security clearance
05:28 um he was the former director of the
05:30 advanced aerospace threat identification
05:33 program
05:34 it is a secretive pentagon unit that
05:37 studied
05:38 these ufos these unidentified aerial
05:40 phenomenons
05:41 and as a senior counterintelligence
05:43 officer for the department of defense
05:44 he operated in afghanistan i've traveled
05:46 there many times look
05:47 lou has been all over the place he has
05:49 worked with our government
05:51 they have entrusted him with some of the
05:52 highest classified secrets
05:54 including this but there is a lot of
05:57 evidence out there
05:58 that this exists and we have been
06:00 witness to that so i think the
06:01 government is coming
06:03 to a point where americans
06:06 are going to be made and the world for
06:07 that matter more
06:09 aware of what these possibilities are
06:12 what is what is it that we're seeing
06:14 what is it that our navy is seeing
06:16 what is it that our uh pilots are seeing
06:18 you know commercial air pilots
06:20 what is it that we are seeing in our
06:22 night skies that we cannot explain
06:26 is this a national security risk yes
06:28 this is a national security risk because
06:30 when you hear
06:30 lou talk about these spacecraft about
06:33 these ships
06:34 that have been recorded and monitored
06:36 and out there now the tic tac
06:38 incident is one of those that you can
06:40 see online
06:41 that the government has declassified you
06:44 can watch his show
06:45 unidentified inside america's ufo
06:48 investigations
06:49 that's inside america's ufo
06:51 investigations
06:53 okay lou this has been a long time
06:54 coming i have
06:56 for so long wanted to just we had a
06:59 lunch together and i wanted to just sit
07:01 down and
07:02 interview you probably for about two
07:04 years now and
07:06 we've always been just kind of hit and
07:07 miss so i'm so grateful to have you
07:10 on the sarah carter show today it means
07:13 a lot to me because
07:14 so much has happened over the last two
07:17 years particularly since you went public
07:20 with the information from the pentagon
07:22 on it's not ufo
07:24 anymore folks not so much not
07:25 unidentified flying objects
07:27 but unidentified aerial phenomena so
07:29 thank you so much lou for being on the
07:31 show today
07:32 miss carter it's my honor and pleasure
07:34 thank you very much and before
07:35 we begin i also want to do a quick thank
07:37 you to your spouse
07:39 um i know he served in the military
07:42 and uh you know unfortunately sustained
07:44 some injuries i just want to say
07:46 thank you for his service and again
07:48 thank you for your service i'm not sure
07:49 the american people realize that
07:51 uh that when a service member goes
07:53 overseas or or serves her country
07:57 there are people that are left behind
07:58 that are that are also still serving
08:00 their country
08:01 and very much you and your family have
08:03 served just as much as he and i want to
08:05 thank you
08:06 on behalf of the american people thank
08:08 you for your service as well oh thank
08:09 you so much lou
08:10 and you also served our nation um i want
08:12 to go into that a little bit let's just
08:14 talk about your background a little bit
08:15 before we
08:16 dive into the subject that everybody is
08:19 like on the edge of their seats uh
08:21 wanting to discuss this is probably
08:23 probably one of the most important
08:25 topics globally
08:27 and i think of interest of science is
08:29 are we alone in the universe
08:31 but uh you're the man on the forefront
08:33 of bringing that
08:35 to the people of the world not just the
08:37 american people but everyone around the
08:38 world we
08:39 we want answers we want to know what's
08:41 going on but you also served
08:43 our nation and you have been serving our
08:46 nation since you were a young man can
08:48 you give people some insight into what
08:49 you've done i mean you've been in
08:50 afghanistan you've been in central
08:52 america south america talk a little bit
08:54 about your work yeah sure uh i think
08:56 like a lot of folks they get into
08:58 uh into some sort of service related
09:01 profession because
09:03 they have a desire to to to serve the
09:05 american people in my case i come from
09:07 on my father's side an immigrant family
09:09 they're all exiles from cuba my father
09:11 was involved in the bay of pigs
09:13 so for me uh for me freedom
09:16 and independence is something that that
09:19 that
09:19 has to be earned and there's a sacrifice
09:21 behind it and i was taught at a very
09:23 young age uh from my my family that you
09:26 know freedom isn't free
09:27 and so for me i i felt that after after
09:30 graduating college
09:31 that it was my time to to give a little
09:34 back uh
09:35 and so i decided to join the united
09:37 states army
09:38 um you know a lot of folks out there
09:40 that have been in the navy and air force
09:41 and whatnot there's this
09:43 kind of rivalry we have i tell people i
09:45 just i guess they didn't have a high
09:46 enough asvab score to get into
09:48 the other services but um i was very
09:52 fortunate and
09:53 as a young man i went into into the
09:54 united states army
09:56 and you know it really it really helped
09:58 me be who i am today from the army i i
10:00 was involved in some
10:02 special activities and programs after
10:04 that and recruited into a very nuanced
10:06 uh effort and uh that took me uh
10:09 to latin america and uh we were running
10:12 intelligence operations primarily
10:14 uh counterinsurgency human intelligence
10:17 counter-intelligence and some
10:18 counter-narcotics
10:20 and then my life changed like like it
10:22 did for for a whole lot of people
10:23 after 9 11 um my my focus became
10:27 primarily at that point counterterrorism
10:29 and counter-intelligence focusing on
10:32 places like afghanistan
10:34 and the middle east um you know no not
10:36 really a whole lot different than other
10:38 folks who've been in the military
10:40 i'm sure they can relate and after that
10:42 i found myself
10:43 working in dc this is the best part guys
10:46 because i mean it's all
10:48 it's all amazing but your life is so
10:51 incredible because
10:52 not only did you work in these very i
10:54 call it cloak and dagger
10:56 um you know uh activities or departments
11:00 within
11:01 the military but then you go to the most
11:05 compelling most secretive most
11:08 investigated i would think area of
11:11 the pentagon right we didn't even know
11:13 until you went public
11:15 that there was a division actually
11:17 continuing to investigate
11:19 unidentified uh aerial phenomena or ufos
11:23 we had no idea
11:24 so talk a little bit about that sorry to
11:25 interrupt but i'm just so excited about
11:27 this part
11:28 of your story no i i i understand um
11:31 you're absolutely right i in 2008 by the
11:34 way i didn't ask for the position uh
11:36 most of the jobs i've ever had in
11:37 in the department uh pretty much i was i
11:39 was voluntold
11:40 i was assigned so as your husband can
11:43 attest a lot of times
11:44 you're just told to do a mission and
11:46 that's what you do that's that's your
11:47 job
11:48 in this particular case in 2008 uh i had
11:51 left
11:52 working the director of national
11:53 intelligence the dni
11:55 and uh was asked to come over to the
11:57 department of defense to establish some
11:59 new programs
12:00 and it was during that time that some
12:02 people approached me uh
12:03 you know not not too different than what
12:06 you would see in a hollywood movie which
12:07 is
12:08 kind of bizarre but some folks showed up
12:10 to my office and they said hey
12:11 are you lou elizondo uh we'd like to
12:14 talk to you and of course the first
12:15 thing that comes to mind is uh oh you
12:17 know
12:17 what i do now right um and uh
12:20 they said listen you know you have uh
12:22 you have some background
12:24 in aerospace we see uh and you're a cia
12:27 guy
12:27 counterintelligence guy and we'd like to
12:29 talk to you about maybe using some of
12:31 your
12:31 expertise in a portfolio that we have
12:34 it's a very nuanced portfolio we can't
12:36 tell you much about it uh but you know
12:38 if you're interested let us know
12:40 and so after about two or three of these
12:42 really kind of mysterious weird meetings
12:44 where
12:44 i wasn't quite sure someone's setting me
12:46 up here is this a joke or
12:48 you know is this some sort of ig
12:49 investigation long story short they
12:51 asked me to
12:52 attend a meeting uh in a undisclosed
12:54 facility uh
12:55 in the dc area and see our national
12:57 capital region
12:59 and there i sat down with the gentleman
13:00 uh he
13:02 you know you're i don't want to say your
13:03 typical scientist but when you think of
13:05 a rocket scientist
13:06 you think of somebody who just you know
13:08 they look they ooze
13:10 that that educated look well this
13:12 gentleman
13:13 was definitely that was it elon musk no
13:16 i'm just joking
13:18 this person was not elon musk uh he had
13:20 a uh he
13:21 wore glasses uh a very nice suit
13:25 but uh clearly he was uh he was indeed a
13:28 scientist and he
13:29 sat down and he asked us to look very
13:31 very uh
13:32 impressive background we think that
13:33 you're going to make a good fit here but
13:35 i got to ask you a question
13:36 i said sure he said what do you think
13:39 about
13:39 ufos and uh kind of
13:43 kind of took me by surprise for a second
13:45 and you know of course you're thinking
13:46 to yourself is this a trick question
13:48 is this just trying to you know assess
13:50 my my gullibility
13:52 and i told them the truth i said uh i i
13:55 don't think about ufos
13:57 i said well what do you mean you don't
13:58 think about ufos i said well i don't
13:59 have the luxury to i don't have an
14:01 opinion either way
14:02 i don't i don't have any data in front
14:04 of me and quite frankly i've i've you
14:05 know
14:06 been busy on other things and
14:09 his response to me was that was that's
14:11 great lou uh you know i'm glad you have
14:13 that open mind but don't let your
14:15 your own your own bias uh analytic bias
14:19 get in your way because you may learn
14:21 some things that will
14:22 really surprise you and that began my
14:24 long road
14:25 uh i mean one second lou did that one
14:28 second lou did that
14:29 when now when i'm hearing you describe
14:32 this moment i mean was it just kind of
14:35 like what went through your mind were
14:36 you just like
14:37 holy cow i am so gonna take this job or
14:40 whoa
14:41 wait a minute do i want to jump into
14:43 this what were the what were the
14:44 thoughts running through your mind at
14:46 that moment
14:47 you know i think the first thought was
14:49 okay there's a hidden camera here
14:50 somewhere
14:51 and a bunch of my my uh old uh
14:54 special operations friends are setting
14:56 me up right i could see them doing that
14:58 right you know and uh because you know
15:00 they're kind of crazy that way sometimes
15:03 uh but you know he didn't flinch and he
15:05 wasn't smiling he wasn't laughing and he
15:07 had a stack of papers on his desk
15:09 and i i knew very quickly he was serious
15:12 this was not a joke
15:13 and so uh you know i i guess i approach
15:17 this the same way i do everything else
15:19 take the take the topic of ufos out of
15:21 the equation
15:22 and what you're left is with a a a big
15:25 question of what something is no
15:27 different than when you're running a
15:28 counter-terrorism investigation or an
15:30 espionage investigation
15:32 you're trying to find facts and you're
15:33 trying to collect evidence
15:35 and present that evidence before a jury
15:38 if you will
15:39 uh so i i think basically my
15:42 my initial response was probably like
15:44 everybody else i kind of leaned back a
15:46 little bit in my chair and kind of
15:47 looked at him and was trying to assess
15:48 his body language
15:49 uh but very quickly i realized he was
15:52 serious and at that point i also
15:53 realized i probably couldn't have this
15:55 conversation
15:56 uh with anybody else at this point
15:59 that's very interesting because
16:00 i this you know this is going back to
16:03 2008 16:04 you ended up taking the job you still
16:06 have a security clearance
16:08 uh there are things that you're and let
16:10 me bring this up so that
16:12 all of you out there who are listening
16:13 to lou right now i mean
16:15 he has this phenomenal show it's called
16:17 unidentified
16:18 inside america's ufo investigation and
16:21 it's on history channel and
16:23 i gotta tell you it just blows my mind
16:25 because he gets people on the show
16:27 uh that have never spoken publicly
16:29 before these are
16:31 senior officials within the military
16:32 people who have
16:34 firsthand witness eyewitness accounts of
16:37 these
16:37 phenomena that cannot be explained um
16:40 but you are very
16:41 clear in the show and you and you're
16:43 very clear in your real in real life
16:45 that you are not going to discuss
16:46 anything that is classified so
16:48 everything that you are discussing right
16:50 now with me
16:51 on the sarah carter show is um these are
16:55 situations that have been declassified
16:57 am i right or situations that you can
16:59 discuss
17:01 i mean these are details i can certainly
17:03 discuss because in order i think
17:05 there's a big mystery on what makes
17:06 information classified
17:08 right and really according to u.s law
17:10 there's really only two things
17:11 the reason why you classify information
17:13 and that's to protect sources
17:15 and methods so as long as i don't get
17:18 into any detail about sources and
17:20 methods
17:20 uh for example uh specifics on
17:23 individuals
17:24 and how information is collected right
17:27 anything that could give away
17:28 a key piece of our capability to a
17:31 foreign adversary
17:32 um i should be okay there are security
17:35 classification guides that i have to
17:36 obviously be familiar with there are
17:38 categories of information that i
17:40 i absolutely cannot discuss and i don't
17:42 intend to i mean i i
17:44 i very much i very much take my my oath
17:47 my security oath seriously my
17:48 non-disclosure agreements i do i still
17:50 do have my
17:52 my security clearance that's an absolute
17:53 fact so uh you know to some degree my
17:56 hands are a little bit tied
17:57 but it from from another perspective too
18:00 i
18:00 i have a lot more freedom now than i
18:03 ever had before when i was when i was an
18:05 18.
18:06 right so talk to me a little bit about
18:08 well first
18:09 let's jump into something that that i
18:12 know all of you out there want to
18:14 to hear first of all it's the tic tac
18:16 incident uh obviously when i was
18:18 texting lou uh yesterday and we were uh
18:21 i was doing it by voice command it said
18:23 the tick tock incident
18:24 no this is the tic tac incident that
18:28 happened um in 2014 correct
18:31 uh and this was with our u.s navy and
18:33 the nimitz can you talk a little bit
18:35 about that because that was the first
18:37 major episode of your series and i found
18:40 it to be so
18:42 fascinating and there were so many
18:45 eyewitnesses
18:46 and you you delved into it like i've
18:48 never seen anyone
18:50 um in regards to taking so seriously
18:53 what is a viable situation that could
18:56 possibly be a threat we don't know
18:58 um of these unidentified aerial
19:00 phenomenas
19:02 yeah sure uh so the tic tac incident
19:04 actually began
19:06 uh in 2004 in november believe
19:10 but actually you're not you're still
19:11 accurate because these events continued
19:13 all the way up until
19:14 to present day so actually you're you
19:17 are accurate but let's let's start i
19:18 guess maybe with
19:19 with the genesis of the whole tic tac
19:21 event for maybe your listeners who
19:22 aren't familiar with it
19:24 in november 2004 the uss
19:28 nimitz battle group which is a
19:30 nuclear-powered aircraft carrier along
19:33 with a bunch of other boats
19:34 they're going out and they're doing what
19:35 they call their work-ups and their
19:37 workups are basically kind of
19:38 kind of training up before you go on a
19:40 real-world deployment right this is
19:42 post-911 19:43 the united states has got a huge
19:44 security posture and the nimitz is about
19:46 to go
19:47 out and and do its job so for the for
19:50 the
19:50 for the months before this this
19:52 deployment
19:53 they're doing workups they're training
19:55 and as a result
19:57 you have this huge navy footprint out in
19:59 the middle of the pacific ocean
20:02 uh off the coast of of san diego
20:04 california
20:05 and lo and behold uh you have these
20:08 these aircraft you have two f-18 20:10 fighters uh
20:11 navy fighters that are in this kind of
20:14 this simulation
20:15 dog fight with two marine corps f-18s
20:19 and this is this is common this is how
20:21 you practice right
20:22 and all of a sudden uh the crackling
20:24 over the radio you
20:25 hear these voices and these voices are
20:28 coming in from
20:30 at the time the e2 hawkeye which is the
20:33 the if you will think of a quarterback
20:35 on a on a ball field they had this huge
20:37 radar dome and their job
20:39 is to have a common operating picture of
20:42 the battle space using this this super
20:43 radar
20:44 you also have a ship the uss princeton
20:48 at the time that has a spy-1 radar one
20:50 of the world's premier
20:52 radar arrays on the planet at the time
20:55 and all of a sudden you hear these
20:57 voices coming into the pilots and the
20:58 pilots
20:59 recount this on actually on the show but
21:02 they've also done this for for others as
21:04 well
21:05 um and all of a sudden they're vectored
21:07 they say hey listen there's something on
21:08 the radar we're picking up we want you
21:10 guys to go check it out
21:12 so lo and behold the two navy f-18s go
21:15 out uh not sure what this is they're
21:16 thinking maybe is it a drill is it an
21:18 exercise
21:19 and the voices on the radio that are
21:21 that are both on the princeton
21:23 and uh on e2 hawkeye say this is not a
21:26 drill this is this is real world
21:28 so naturally the pilots are thinking
21:29 maybe this is some sort of drug
21:31 interdiction
21:32 or maybe there's an airplane that went
21:33 down and as they look into the water
21:35 they notice
21:37 this roiling of the ocean and above that
21:40 is this object that is described by the
21:43 pilots as a
21:44 white tic tac it's this perfectly smooth
21:49 cylindrical shaped object no wings no
21:52 no means of thrust or propulsion no
21:54 cockpit no lights no rivets just as
21:57 smooth
21:58 object that looks like like a white tic
22:00 tac and this thing
22:01 is moving erratically over the surface
22:03 of the water
22:04 uh about 50 feet uh and not like a
22:06 helicopter that would be hovering this
22:08 thing is is really moving erratically
22:09 how big is it it's about
22:12 how big was it yep yeah you're about
22:14 right about 40 feet
22:16 an approximate estimation is about it's
22:18 this object's about 40 feet
22:19 and as one of the pilots uh at the time
22:22 commander dave fravor goes into a little
22:24 bit more of an offensive position to get
22:26 a
22:26 a good look at this thing all of a
22:28 sudden this thing
22:29 starts countering his maneuvers uh
22:32 elevates in altitude
22:34 and then all of a sudden just takes off
22:36 like a bat out of hell
22:37 gone over the horizon within within
22:39 literally blink of an eye
22:41 and this was witnessed not only by
22:42 commander fravor and jim slate who have
22:45 now been on the record to talk about
22:46 this
22:47 but two other individuals who are still
22:49 by the way active duty and very senior
22:51 in the navy
22:52 um whose identity i won't reveal right
22:54 now because they've asked not to be to
22:56 be revealed
22:57 uh but they all saw the same object at
22:59 the same time at the same place do
23:00 exactly the same thing now
23:02 let's let's take this into context these
23:03 are trained observers these are
23:05 individuals who are trained to look at
23:07 at an aircraft 20 miles away and and
23:10 determine is it an f-16 is an sg22 is it
23:13 a mig-25 23:14 or is it a you know a european tornado
23:17 and yet this thing doesn't look like any
23:19 aircraft they've ever seen oh by the way
23:21 it turns out
23:22 that this encounter was backed up by
23:24 radar data
23:25 on both the e2 hawkeye and the uss
23:29 princeton and there's gun camera footage
23:31 right so
23:32 for it's it's easy for someone to say
23:34 look you know maybe they saw something
23:36 it was an optical illusion it was a
23:37 weather anomaly
23:38 but now you have it actually on gun
23:41 camera footage
23:42 and radar data so you have three
23:44 separate
23:45 data points all looking at the same
23:47 object at the same place
23:49 and doing the same things i mean this
23:51 was really the first time we had this
23:53 compelling data
23:54 we had the technology to to to
23:57 to capture one of these things after
24:00 that
24:01 was that when the pentagon realized okay
24:03 this is
24:04 really important the us military i know
24:06 other
24:07 other nations other nation status great
24:10 britain
24:11 france uh germany other nations
24:14 russia are very interested in what
24:18 they consider to be ufos you know
24:20 unidentified flying objects unidentified
24:22 aerial phenomena
24:24 was this the point where the united
24:25 states government said
24:27 whoa wait a minute we need to start
24:29 monitoring this or did it happen
24:31 later after numerous other sightings
24:35 that's a great question you know that
24:36 the answer is going to be both
24:38 yes and no and let me explain that for a
24:40 minute so there
24:41 the united states government has had
24:43 other quote unquote ufo or uap
24:45 programs in the past and i think most
24:47 notably people are aware of
24:49 maybe or maybe tangentially of a program
24:51 called project blue book
24:53 um you know our since world war ii our
24:56 pilots have been reporting strange
24:58 things in the sky
24:59 back then they refer to them as quote
25:01 unquote foo fighters
25:02 um but enough pilots were witnessing
25:05 these and allied pilots where
25:07 i think the us military realized there's
25:09 something to this what
25:10 this is we don't know yet but but
25:12 something is really there
25:14 and so you've had over decades these
25:16 different iterations of programs
25:19 that have come forward and been revealed
25:21 now
25:22 when you asked me the question is this
25:24 the first time the u.s
25:26 government in recent history took this
25:28 topic seriously
25:30 the answer was a definitive yes but i'll
25:32 also share with you sarah that
25:34 uh not too long ago for
25:38 for a while when i was when i was part
25:39 of atef i really thought this
25:41 this was it we were kind of the the
25:43 first if you will and premier
25:45 uh program like this in the u.s
25:47 government but it wasn't until
25:49 afterwards that uh and i have to be
25:51 careful about providing the
25:52 circumstances but
25:53 i met an individual and i met this
25:55 individual in official us government
25:57 spaces
25:58 and this individual was sponsored by
26:00 some very very senior people
26:02 and they asked me to come in and give
26:04 them uh if
26:06 you will a back briefing of the aids
26:08 program and these again these are senior
26:09 government officials so
26:11 i gave them a briefing and i noticed
26:13 there was a gentleman sitting in the
26:14 back corner older gentleman
26:16 didn't say anything didn't introduce
26:18 himself was just listening to me
26:20 and because i was invited to speak with
26:22 them obviously i'm not going to ask them
26:24 who this individual is it's really
26:25 frankly none of my business
26:27 when i was finished with this this
26:29 briefing
26:30 the individual stood up he walked over
26:32 to me he he shook my hand he said i just
26:35 wanted to let you know
26:36 lou i used to have your program
26:40 now i didn't know what he meant by that
26:41 because obviously i've had a lot of
26:42 programs in in my time
26:44 in my career and i said so which one are
26:47 you referring to
26:49 and he looked at me he said the program
26:50 you're briefing on right now
26:52 i used to run the same program
26:55 back in the navy in the 1980s
26:59 so that exactly right that
27:02 to me that was that was kind of a
27:05 frankly a stunning moment because
27:07 up to that point truthfully truthfully i
27:10 didn't know that there was ever truly
27:12 another program after
27:13 after blue book right because blue book
27:15 was supposed to be the end of it
27:17 just for every one of you out there who
27:18 doesn't know about project blue book i
27:20 mean blue book really
27:22 uh was like we're closing the books the
27:24 united states government
27:25 on you know aerial phenomena we don't
27:27 have any evidence of it it was like when
27:29 the air force tried to throw everybody
27:32 off um
27:32 for those people especially that believe
27:35 and that
27:36 have said there's so much evidence out
27:38 there that there is
27:39 uh unidentified flying objects or aerial
27:42 phenomena that is not from this earth or
27:44 appears not to be from this earth or
27:46 something that the united states
27:47 government can't identify
27:49 am i right lou that this was project
27:51 blue book was
27:52 they were out there to investigate it
27:54 and basically after project blue book
27:57 the they threw away the key that's what
27:59 we were told
28:00 yeah you're 100 correct and i'll share
28:02 something else with you sarah and your
28:04 audience that very few people are aware
28:06 of
28:06 when i went down to south america latin
28:08 america here this last year for for one
28:10 of the episodes we had spoken to with
28:12 some very senior
28:13 uh active duty military personnel and
28:16 some other countries down there
28:18 i was absolutely floored when i went to
28:20 uruguay
28:21 i spoke to to some of the military
28:24 individuals who run their existing
28:26 program now here in the united states we
28:28 don't like to talk about it but down
28:29 there in latin america and other
28:31 countries
28:31 they have no problems talking about uaps
28:34 ufos in fact they have
28:35 actually official government sanctioned
28:38 programs that's that's paid by the
28:39 government
28:40 and in this particular case the longest
28:42 standing government
28:44 controlled ufo program in in
28:47 this hemisphere is actually out of
28:49 uruguay and when i went down there
28:51 and they started giving me a briefing on
28:53 their current investigations
28:54 and what what they're seeing i asked
28:57 them very specifically you know
28:59 you you began back in the late 70s what
29:01 predicated this
29:02 why did you start this program back in
29:05 the 70s
29:06 and they they said to me and it's
29:08 actually that's on camera
29:09 they said we started this program
29:12 because of a direct
29:13 request by the united states embassy
29:17 in 1978 here they asked us to do it and
29:20 then they provided
29:21 us the united states embassy provided us
29:24 all the
29:25 the the investigative material and
29:28 standard operating procedures
29:29 for project blue book and also was so
29:32 was uruguay a cut out
29:35 was that what it was possession you're
29:38 absolutely right i mean that that's one
29:40 is led to believe that okay the u.s
29:42 government is washing their hands
29:43 officially of this
29:44 or certainly at least publicly but
29:46 behind back channels
29:47 is asking other countries to now do what
29:50 the u.s government is pretending not to
29:52 do and when they open up the books i'm
29:55 looking at these sops i'm looking at the
29:57 investigative procedures
29:58 they are absolutely right out of the
30:00 united states
30:01 handbook for project blue book so the
30:04 question is
30:05 why is there such a disparity is it a
30:07 stigma issue uh is it a is there some
30:09 sort of weird national security issue
30:12 so those are some of the things some of
30:13 the questions that you know when you say
30:15 the program ended right well you brought
30:18 up something maybe no
30:19 well you brought up something sorry to
30:20 cut you off but when you brought up
30:21 something that was
30:22 really important and i think i i heard
30:24 it repeated
30:25 um over and over again in your
30:28 television series
30:29 unidentified inside america's ufo
30:31 investigation for all of you out there
30:33 who are interested in this subject i
30:34 i mean this is for me like if i were to
30:36 do anything else in my life this is what
30:38 i would study because i think it's
30:40 probably going to be one of the greatest
30:41 if not the greatest discoveries in human
30:43 history
30:44 will be to find out that we're either
30:46 not alone in the universe or that we are
30:48 i mean we don't have the answers yet so
30:50 i think this is for me one of the
30:52 greatest
30:53 moments of human history and we're at an
30:55 apex now where we can
30:57 we can record these this is what lou's
30:58 saying we can you know
31:00 monitor our skies the way we've never
31:03 been able to before but you said lou
31:05 you would say this is a process not an
31:08 event
31:10 that was really interesting to me
31:12 because
31:13 and he's talking you were talking about
31:15 the revelation
31:17 like for humanity to understand like i
31:19 mean it would be kind of weird
31:21 if like all of a sudden out of nowhere
31:23 um
31:24 we were visited right we had an
31:26 encounter what they call a close
31:27 encounter like just a ship landed and
31:29 all of a sudden like
31:30 you know it's like independence day or
31:32 something crazy aliens are running
31:34 around and they're looking weird and i
31:35 mean
31:36 i think it would throw a shock wave
31:37 through our planet but
31:39 um but a process a process of unraveling
31:42 right
31:43 our universe what do you mean by that is
31:46 it our process
31:47 is it the process of who we're being
31:49 visited by
31:50 what do you think it is that we're
31:52 coming to an a point where
31:55 we're gonna have some of these answers
31:58 well i i you know that's a first of all
32:01 thank you for asking that question
32:02 because i
32:03 i do i i think that quote-unquote
32:06 disclosure with a capital d
32:08 uh is a process and it's a process for
32:10 for for many people for for many
32:12 different reasons
32:14 you know i i've often said that this is
32:15 a topic that affects us all
32:17 equally because we all live on this
32:19 little rock together called earth
32:21 but also differently because we're all
32:23 we're all raised a little different we
32:25 have
32:25 different philosophical leanings and
32:27 theological leanings and sociological
32:29 leanings and
32:30 political leanings right so it this is a
32:33 topic that
32:34 you know i'm not a smart enough man to
32:37 tell
32:38 people what how they should how they
32:40 should process this that's not my job
32:43 you want to know what that is to go talk
32:44 to your your priest or your rabbi
32:46 or you want to talk to a an academic or
32:49 a scientist
32:50 my job is simply to look at this from a
32:52 national security perspective
32:54 and and we've come to realize that
32:58 even just from that narrow slice of the
33:00 pie perspective
33:01 it's been a monumental effort there are
33:03 people who
33:04 just don't want to have the conversation
33:07 um
33:08 and there's again a lot of reasons for
33:10 it uh why is that
33:11 right we name some of them name just a
33:14 couple of those reasons why people
33:15 won't want to discuss this
33:18 wow uh well i can tell you from personal
33:20 persp personal perspective
33:22 um i've had an experience where i had a
33:25 very senior person in the u.s government
33:27 told me flat out lou we want you to stop
33:30 this program
33:31 and my response was well okay sir i i
33:34 can understand that but can you
33:36 can you give me the reason why uh
33:38 because
33:39 from our perspective these things are
33:41 absolutely real we
33:43 we are seeing these we're recording them
33:44 we've got the date on them
33:46 and the response back to me was lou
33:48 we're not arguing that they're real we
33:50 know they're real
33:51 but we don't think we don't think you
33:53 know what they really
33:54 are and so at that point i'm thinking oh
33:56 maybe this is some sort of secret
33:58 u.s kind of program that they didn't
34:00 read me onto which i'm fine with
34:02 uh and i said well okay sir that's
34:04 that's fine and
34:06 his response back to me was what you're
34:08 dealing with
34:09 are demonic beings and
34:13 you know i can respect people's
34:14 philosophical and theological positions
34:16 you know
34:16 i'm not here to argue that with anybody
34:18 but at the same time
34:20 to to jump to a conclusion like that and
34:22 stop a
34:23 a valid program for looking at a
34:25 potential national security threat
34:28 because it um goes against one's
34:31 theological belief
34:32 belief system i think that's a mistake
34:35 and that's just one example i've had
34:36 i'll tell you another example
34:37 i was a at a briefing edit with a very
34:40 very senior member of the department of
34:41 defense i mean one of the top top people
34:44 uh i won't mention the person's name and
34:46 after an hour briefing and showing
34:47 videos and having pilots come in
34:49 and give their testimony at the end of
34:52 that discussion
34:53 i had this complete blank stare on this
34:55 person's face
34:57 and they looked at me and they asked me
34:59 about the
35:00 how the miami hurricanes are doing this
35:02 football season
35:04 and it occurred to me at that point that
35:06 we're talking about a topic that some
35:08 people just for whatever reason
35:10 you just can't process it um and and i'm
35:13 i'm pretty sure different people are
35:15 going to take this differently
35:17 um so i i can't speak on behalf of
35:20 everybody but i can tell you from
35:21 personal
35:21 experience there are some there are some
35:24 individuals who that for whatever reason
35:27 this just conflicts with their their
35:29 view on how the world should be
35:31 and and how the universe should be
35:33 potentially and
35:34 do you think lou do you think um that we
35:38 have
35:39 actually been visited i mean i'm just
35:41 you know
35:42 do you believe that like others like
35:45 some people
35:46 just chalk it up to oh maybe this is
35:48 some kind of government classified
35:50 government program that we
35:51 just don't understand or do you believe
35:54 based on the
35:55 evidence that has been collected and the
35:57 people that you have interviewed just
35:58 based on that
36:00 that there is something here that goes
36:02 far beyond
36:03 our our earth something that we may be
36:06 dealing with i mean i find it hard to
36:07 believe that we're alone in such a vast
36:09 universe
36:10 well you know let's let's let's start
36:12 with it with uh you asked me a a
36:14 question i think that's
36:15 that deserves a a thorough answer so let
36:17 me start by saying you know
36:18 people say well could this be some sort
36:20 of secret u.s technology well
36:22 you don't spend 22 million dollars of
36:24 taxpayer money
36:26 to try to figure out your own technology
36:28 you don't do that
36:29 you don't fly a super secret aircraft
36:31 over major populated u.s cities if you
36:33 want them to stay secret
36:34 we have entire test ranges for that
36:36 purpose
36:37 so for someone to make the argument this
36:39 is really some sort of u.s secret
36:41 technology
36:42 um if that was the case this would be
36:44 such a breakdown
36:45 in in our own ability to to
36:48 be aware situational wear over on skies
36:52 that we'd be in trouble we'd have to
36:54 fire the entire department of defense in
36:56 the intelligence community and start
36:58 over so
36:58 i don't think it's our technology the
37:00 next question is is it foreign
37:01 adversarial technology well
37:02 okay let's go down that rabbit hole for
37:04 a second if that's the case
37:06 then there is some foreign adversary who
37:07 has managed to leapfrog ahead of us
37:09 not just to next generation technology
37:12 but
37:12 beyond next generation technology and oh
37:15 by the way they've done this now for
37:16 decades
37:17 if that's the case and that's really
37:19 what's happening here then you're
37:21 looking at one of the
37:22 greatest intelligence failures of this
37:25 country
37:25 eclip eclipsing that of of 911 37:28 intelligence failures so
37:30 so if that's the case then we've got
37:32 some significant problems now
37:35 let's take out of the equation it's not
37:37 u.s technology and it's not foreign
37:38 adversarial technology
37:40 then what is it well i think there's
37:42 lots of options uh
37:44 without going into what my personal
37:46 opinion is because
37:47 i think sarah at the end of the day my
37:49 opinion doesn't count i know people want
37:51 to know lou what do you think and at the
37:52 end of the day
37:53 it doesn't really matter what lou thinks
37:55 my job as an investigator
37:57 has always been very simple collect the
37:59 truth speak the truth
38:00 that's it and provide that information
38:02 that evidence to the jury
38:04 and in this case sarah as i've mentioned
38:06 before you
38:07 are the jury your audience is the jury
38:10 so
38:11 my job is simple give the information
38:13 provide it over to you
38:14 in a consumable manner and then you make
38:17 a determination
38:18 what it means tell me that evidence
38:20 because this is so important i want
38:22 people to understand at least with
38:24 the tic tac incident right and the
38:26 incidents that we've
38:27 and you've been able to uh expose and
38:30 document
38:31 along with others explain just quickly
38:34 kind of
38:35 what the capabilities of these
38:37 technologies that we're monitoring
38:39 are doing just so you guys out there can
38:41 understand it because it's incredible i
38:43 mean
38:44 when you hear what he has to say it's
38:46 going to blow your mind because
38:47 we don't have anything today nothing
38:49 today that can actually do that that
38:51 i've
38:52 ever seen or read about you're
38:55 absolutely correct sarah um and this is
38:57 why in in the program that i was part of
38:59 at
38:59 we had to as an intelligence
39:01 organization because ultimately this
39:02 wasn't intelligence activity
39:04 we had to try to if you will separate
39:07 the wheat
39:08 right from from from the chaff and in
39:10 order to do that
39:11 what you need to do is come up with
39:13 certain categories
39:15 that allow you to put these objects into
39:18 these little neat boxes and say okay
39:20 this is something that truly does not
39:22 fit into anything that we currently have
39:24 so
39:25 what are those categories well we refer
39:27 to them as the as the observables
39:29 and there are five if you will
39:32 observables from a scientific
39:34 perspective we can look at and say okay
39:36 that is definitely not our technology so
39:38 the question is what are those
39:39 observables well the first one
39:41 is instantaneous acceleration let's take
39:44 this pen for a second
39:45 and if i go from this position to this
39:48 position and back again
39:49 there are certain inertial forces that
39:52 are experienced
39:53 on the pen and it's a product of
39:55 acceleration
39:56 and so that put this into context the
39:58 human being can withstand about
39:59 nine g forces before you start having
40:02 significant physiological effects on the
40:05 human body in fact we create g
40:06 suits to try to minimize those effects
40:10 now that in comparison to let's say an
40:12 f-16 which is one of our most highly
40:14 maneuverable aircraft
40:15 designed specifically for to handle
40:17 these heavy g-loads
40:18 can hold about 16 g's before you start
40:21 having wings snap off the aircraft
40:23 the objects we're seeing are performing
40:26 well above
40:26 400 500 600 700 40:30 g-forces something well beyond the
40:33 the healthy biological limitations for
40:36 something to withstand
40:37 that's just so you're done insane i mean
40:39 when you think about that it's insane i
40:41 mean it
40:42 for us to comprehend that it's it's it's
40:45 so fast
40:46 for for all of you out there that are
40:48 listening to lou it would be so fast
40:50 that it would be like you would see your
40:51 pen in your right hand and then it would
40:53 automatically just show up in your left
40:54 you wouldn't even see the movement it's
40:56 that fast or actually it would be a
40:59 greater analogy is you you have a pen in
41:00 your left hand all of a sudden it shows
41:02 up in miami
41:03 i mean that's you're talking about
41:04 something that is accelerating
41:07 well beyond anything that we know
41:09 technologically and we have that
41:11 documented correct
41:12 we have that document absolutely we do
41:15 and it's on radar and
41:16 we've had this actually the scary thing
41:17 is we've had this data since going back
41:19 to the 1950s
41:20 um but that's another story and then the
41:22 other observable the second observable
41:25 because i haven't forgot your question
41:26 is hypersonic velocity now hypersonic
41:28 velocity are those
41:30 speeds that are defined in excess of
41:32 mach 5 41:33 so you're looking at speeds well above
41:35 3000 miles an hour
41:37 now we know there's only a few vehicles
41:39 that that are in our inventory can go
41:41 that fast
41:42 not a nasty time right no we're talking
41:45 like
41:45 like literally a rocket right or we're
41:48 talking about a hypersonic missile
41:50 and by the way those objects can't stop
41:53 on a dime and they can't change
41:54 directions right they're moving
41:56 so fast that that it you can't change
41:59 directions plus there's something called
42:00 signatures
42:01 when you're moving that fast you have
42:03 heat ablation off the front of the
42:04 aircraft you have
42:05 atmospheric ionization the stripping of
42:08 the electrons
42:09 off of the atmosphere you have acoustic
42:11 signatures like sonic booms and you have
42:13 contrails right
42:14 the smoke that everybody sees behind a
42:16 jet plane when it's flying at altitude
42:18 and yet these things have none of those
42:20 signatures they don't have a sound
42:22 they're not breaking you don't hear the
42:23 sound barrier being being broken that
42:25 that sonic boom
42:26 you don't have the associated contrails
42:30 you don't have anything and these are
42:32 somehow able to do it they have no wings
42:34 they have no control surfaces they have
42:36 no obvious means of propulsion
42:38 so that's the second observable the
42:39 third observable is a bit of an oxymoron
42:41 but
42:42 it's called low observability they're
42:43 hard to track on radar when you look at
42:45 them with the naked eye
42:47 you see something but it's really hard
42:48 to figure out what it is
42:50 uh are they cloaked i mean is it cloaked
42:53 is that how you're seeing it is it
42:54 kind of like cloaked against the sky or
42:56 is it because it's moving so fast
42:58 well in some cases when it's not moving
43:00 it's hovering it's still
43:02 really bizarre um the human eye can
43:04 sometimes
43:05 see it and see it clearly but we have
43:07 nothing to compare it to
43:09 to to describe it like you see like you
43:11 hear it it's a giant tic tac right
43:13 but what does that mean i mean a tic tac
43:15 shouldn't fly a tic-tac doesn't hover a
43:17 tic-tac doesn't
43:18 move at hypersonic velocities and yet
43:20 that's what all of them are seeing
43:22 it makes no sense and yet there it is
43:24 and there it is in the in the gun camera
43:26 and
43:27 there it is on radar so so that's kind
43:29 of one of those
43:30 those things that you look at from a
43:31 category perspective low observability
43:34 where it's still this enigma right the
43:36 fourth observable is something called
43:38 transmedium travel so back to our
43:40 aircraft analogy here
43:41 a plane looks like a plane because we
43:43 designed it to fly in the atmosphere it
43:44 has a nose it has a tail it has an
43:46 engine it has a rudder because it has to
43:48 fly
43:49 now a plane doesn't look like a rocket a
43:51 rocket that is in
43:53 in low earth orbit there is no
43:54 atmosphere in fact wings are useless so
43:56 you have thrusters and you have a
43:58 chemical rocket engine
44:00 and if you compare a rocket to let's say
44:01 a submarine a submarine is under water
44:03 it doesn't look like a plane or a rocket
44:05 it uses a propeller and it uses
44:07 buoyancy to to go up and down so
44:10 my point being here is that when you
44:12 have an object that you want to operate
44:14 in two different environments
44:15 let's say a seaplane right you can have
44:18 a plane that flies and also one that
44:20 lands in water
44:21 but it's always a design compromise a
44:23 sea plane is neither a really good
44:25 airplane
44:25 nor is it really good on the water it's
44:27 always a compromise yet the things we're
44:29 seeing
44:30 can fly in our atmosphere potentially
44:33 low earth orbit and even under water
44:35 and they're not changing their design
44:36 characteristics they can perform exactly
44:38 the same
44:39 as they do in any other environment so
44:42 that just blows my mind
44:43 and we have evidence of this
44:46 the pentagon has evidence of this the
44:48 defense department has evidence of this
44:50 this is a situation
44:51 actually that happened off the coast of
44:53 catalina correct where they actually saw
44:55 military personnel actually saw one of
44:57 these described tic tacs go
45:00 under the water correct yeah it was
45:03 reported and even and potentially been
45:04 picked up by
45:05 by submarines if your your audience is
45:07 interested there is a
45:08 a little known uh uh i don't know how to
45:12 say this the right way um
45:14 a little known endeavor uh and there was
45:16 by the navy
45:17 and they actually have a nickname for
45:19 these things
45:20 and they're called fast movers these are
45:22 objects that are being tracked under
45:23 water
45:24 uh moving much much quicker than the
45:28 laws of physics
45:29 allow underwater uh so just kind of
45:32 if you're interested you can look up
45:34 that term fast navy fast movers and
45:36 and you'll see some data on it and of
45:38 course the last observable is positive
45:39 lift
45:40 or i guess maybe in the vernacular
45:42 anti-gravity
45:43 you have an object in order to to defy
45:45 the natural effects of earth's
45:47 gravitational pull
45:48 there's really only three ways to do it
45:50 one is is flight right you have your
45:52 plane here flying
45:53 and you have four fundamental forces you
45:55 have thrust
45:56 lift drag and weight and when you know
45:58 how to how to manipulate
46:00 those you can have an airplane you fly
46:02 another way
46:03 is sheer ballistics you can put enough
46:05 of a of a
46:06 charge under something like a giant
46:08 mortar or a missile
46:10 where you can literally blow it up uh
46:12 for a little while to flying earth's
46:14 gravity
46:15 and then of course it comes back it
46:16 falls back down and then the last way
46:19 is through buoyancy or lighter than air
46:21 like a hot air balloon or a helium
46:23 balloon that we see all the time
46:25 uh these uh for will will seemingly defy
46:28 the natural effects of earth's gravity
46:30 until it gets up to about a certain
46:32 altitude and then they come back down
46:33 again
46:34 but those are really the only ways we
46:36 know how to
46:37 to defy earth's gravity and yet these
46:40 things don't have wings they don't have
46:41 engines they don't have control surfaces
46:43 by all accounts these things are flying
46:46 but they don't have any means of lift
46:49 there's no there's no rocket engine
46:51 there's no jet engine there's no
46:52 propeller
46:53 there's nothing and so yet there it is
46:56 again
46:57 the the enigma that we're forced to deal
47:00 with
47:01 that we're pretty we know it's not our
47:03 technology we're pretty darn sure it's
47:04 not foreign adversarial technology
47:06 so then whose is it right so this is
47:09 more i'm going to ask a few more
47:11 questions because i i need to get to
47:12 these with you lou
47:13 i'm taking a lot longer than i would
47:15 normally with any other guest because
47:17 it's so fascinating to me
47:18 so i i'm going to ask you here live so
47:21 to speak
47:22 uh on the air with you would you be
47:24 willing to continue to come back
47:26 on the sarah carter show and just be
47:28 able to
47:30 talk to us more about this because this
47:32 to me
47:33 is one of the most important stories of
47:36 our lifetime
47:37 i mean i've covered a lot of stories
47:39 nothing
47:40 compares to this in my opinion
47:43 sarah you have an amazing show it would
47:45 be my honor and privilege
47:46 to come back any time you want wow you
47:49 guys heard that out there right
47:50 you heard it out there lou elizado has
47:53 agreed to come back on the show and
47:55 and just and we're going to work on this
47:57 together because i think
47:58 getting the word out to the american
48:00 people which is going to lead me to this
48:01 question
48:02 has the president president trump and
48:05 other
48:06 presidents i know we've i've i've i've
48:08 remember bob lazar
48:10 and and he he was somebody who came out
48:13 and spoke out and a lot of people
48:15 uh who are i guess i would i don't want
48:18 to say ufo fans or people that are
48:20 interested in the subject
48:21 know who bob lazar is that he said he
48:23 worked at area 51 48:25 that he said other presidents were aware
48:26 of this um i'd like to get your take on
48:28 him but
48:29 is president trump aware of what is
48:32 interested aware of what is happening
48:34 now and
48:34 also the senate intelligence committee
48:36 and others that i mean because to me
48:38 this is a real national security issue
48:42 um so sarah i'm going to try to answer
48:44 this as as best i can without
48:47 without answering on behalf of other
48:48 people um
48:50 because i'm no longer in the u.s
48:52 government i do not have the right or
48:54 the privilege to answer on behalf of the
48:56 us government but
48:57 i think it's it's fair to to assess at
49:00 this point
49:01 that the president of the united states
49:03 has been briefed on aspects of this
49:06 and certainly members of congress have
49:08 been
49:09 in some cases i have i have
49:12 direct knowledge of some of these
49:15 briefings with that
49:16 said who was actually briefed on what
49:18 they were actually briefed on
49:20 um i'm i'm gonna politely deflect and
49:23 allow
49:23 them to answer that question and i think
49:26 when you when you have senators
49:28 being briefed on topic and they come
49:30 back and they say
49:31 hey by the way this is serious we need
49:33 to look into it that should be an
49:34 indicator to the american people
49:36 that this is a serious topic you don't
49:38 have elected officials putting their
49:40 political careers on the line
49:41 and potentially their election just to
49:44 go chase shadows that's that's
49:45 that's not what they're going to do
49:47 these people are risk-averse
49:49 and you know that one of their prime
49:51 primary uh motivations is to be
49:53 re-elected and if you look like a kook
49:54 or a loon
49:55 chances are you're not going to get
49:56 re-elected right so i i think it's
49:59 fair to say that enough people now
50:02 there's a critical mass where enough
50:03 people have realized
50:04 that this is this is real the reality is
50:08 here now but the stigma is changing but
50:10 the stigma
50:11 is changing lou the stigma is changing
50:13 that's what we're seeing a change
50:15 in the stigma it's not just about you
50:18 know i used to call it ufo theory every
50:20 time somebody would try to downplay a
50:22 story
50:23 or make it a conspiracy theory i would
50:26 call it ufo theory because for a long
50:28 time
50:28 you know somebody would say oh i saw
50:30 something in the sky it was completely
50:31 bizarre or you know
50:33 these would be normal people with no
50:36 psychological issues whatsoever
50:38 and immediately even if it was on the
50:40 news you would hear newscasters like
50:42 hahaha you know they would play ufo
50:44 music
50:45 they would laugh about it they would
50:47 blow it off but now
50:49 tucker carlson um who i think is
50:52 a remarkable guy fox news or a friend
50:55 somebody who i have a lot of respect for
50:57 is he put you on his show he is taking
51:00 this seriously and he has said
51:02 this story himself he has said is
51:05 one of the greatest stories of modern
51:08 human history if we can if we can prove
51:11 it
51:13 well the stigma is changing in part
51:15 because of the courage of people like
51:16 you sir i mean you are in the media
51:18 and you have a tremendous amount to lose
51:22 from a credibility perspective and you
51:24 know i think you're right i think three
51:26 years ago
51:27 you were probably considered crazy to
51:29 report on this
51:30 issue and now i think we're seeing a
51:32 change where you know you almost got to
51:33 be crazy not to report on this issue
51:35 because there's just
51:36 there's so much evidence now being
51:38 provided both at the at the unclassified
51:40 and at the classified levels and so a
51:42 lot of this stigma
51:44 that you're seeing that is kind of
51:45 melting away is because people like you
51:47 are willing to go ahead and report on
51:49 this topic for the first time and
51:51 and not laugh and not giggle and you
51:53 know think of
51:54 tinfoil hats or quote unquote elvis on
51:56 the mothership
51:57 this is a potentially real national
51:58 security issue and our politicians
52:01 are are getting briefed on this and and
52:03 they are agreeing this is a
52:04 a significant potentially national
52:06 security issue so
52:08 if you want to know why that stigma is
52:09 changing i i would suggest look in the
52:11 mirror it's changing because people like
52:13 you have the courage to report on it
52:14 well thank you so much lou and i okay so
52:17 this is what we need to talk about next
52:18 time i'm gonna just throw it out there
52:20 we need to talk about tom dalon
52:21 and you know blink 132 and how he got
52:25 uh you know in touch with you and how
52:27 this all came about to inform the
52:29 american people i am a huge fan of his
52:32 too so i know you and i talked about
52:34 that yesterday i want to ask you more
52:36 about
52:36 um bob lazar um maybe give me one
52:39 sentence your quick
52:40 thoughts on him um do you have any or do
52:42 you not want to talk about it
52:45 uh i don't know mr lazar uh
52:48 i've never met him and i don't know him
52:49 personally so you know i think it's
52:51 probably
52:52 as i mentioned earlier i don't like to
52:54 give my opinion um
52:55 you know especially if it's an
52:57 uninformed
52:58 opinion uh i you know i
53:02 i don't even like to give opinions about
53:03 myself quite frankly let alone somebody
53:05 else so
53:06 i i'll probably um politely again
53:10 reflect that question as well but tom i
53:13 can talk about i know i know tom quite
53:14 well
53:16 totally fine so tom is good and i wanted
53:19 i'm going to get into more about uruguay
53:22 i want to talk about the
53:24 i actually did cover an event in
53:26 washington dc i don't know if you
53:27 remember this it was a big
53:29 congressional hearing uh that happened
53:31 um years ago
53:33 and uh people from all over the world
53:35 testified
53:36 that would be you remember that uh yeah
53:38 it was that was a citizen i heard about
53:40 the citizens hearing
53:41 we stayed away from it on purpose
53:43 because obviously you know we didn't
53:44 want to
53:44 cross streams but yeah we were aware of
53:46 it absolutely yeah so the citizens
53:48 hearing so i was very well we
53:49 i talked to the folks that were
53:51 witnesses to randall from forest
53:52 incident in
53:53 in great britain near our nuclear sites
53:56 i talked to
53:57 pilots from iran pilots from british
54:00 airways that
54:01 actually saw and and gave testimony to
54:04 congress that they actually saw
54:06 unidentified aerial phenomenon that they
54:08 could not explain so i would
54:10 love to get into all those details with
54:12 you and before i let you go is there any
54:14 last words you'd like to
54:15 say i mean because i think for so many
54:17 people it's kind of a frightening
54:20 new idea for them you know like
54:23 we may not be alone and if we're not
54:27 and what we're seeing belongs to uh
54:30 civilization
54:31 which appears to be far more advanced
54:33 than ours
54:35 that's a little concerning uh
54:39 you know i i think with every challenge
54:41 comes opportunity
54:42 uh i think it can absolutely be
54:44 concerning i also
54:46 think there could be you know
54:47 potentially some some benefits
54:49 if that was the case i would like to say
54:51 one alibi here and that is if people
54:53 really want to know how serious the
54:54 government is taking this
54:56 they only have to look at the rental
54:57 shim incident which he just brought up
54:59 and realized that
55:00 two individuals that were directly
55:02 involved in that incident i won't go
55:04 into more detail but
55:06 your audience can look it up have just
55:08 recently been given
55:10 full benefits disability benefits
55:13 by the us government and it specifies
55:16 because of their involvement in the
55:18 rendelsham incident
55:20 that is on paper that is documented by
55:23 the u.s government admitting
55:25 they sustained injuries as a result of
55:27 that event so
55:28 i'll i'll leave you and your audience
55:30 with that and also the fact that
55:32 you asked me is it possible there's life
55:34 in the universe and my response is
55:36 just look around you life is everywhere
55:38 on this one little rock we call earth
55:41 life is is is in the deepest part of the
55:43 of the antarctic ice it's in the
55:45 the darkest and deepest places of the
55:48 ocean
55:48 uh it's on the tallest mountains it's
55:50 everywhere so
55:52 um i think maybe what we need to do is
55:54 is
55:55 kind of sit back for a little bit and
55:56 maybe re-evaluate of what we consider
55:59 life is
55:59 what it means to be to be be a living
56:03 thing perhaps
56:04 i think i couldn't have said it better
56:06 myself that was
56:08 excellent lou thank you so much you have
56:10 given me so much hope and so much to
56:12 think about
56:13 it is probably one of the things that i
56:15 think makes every human being
56:17 uh you know the biggest question is who
56:19 are we why are we here
56:21 are we alone and now we probably know
56:24 that we are not
56:25 just looking into this is going to be i
56:27 think it's going to be a lifetime
56:28 pursuit of mine and thank you for
56:30 agreeing to be
56:31 on the show with me today i really
56:33 appreciate it
56:34 all right i don't even know how to top
56:35 that i can't top that so i'm wrapping it
56:38 up
56:38 remember i'm going to bring lou elizado
56:40 back on
56:41 this show because i want him to explain
56:43 so much more i need to talk to him about
56:45 so much more
56:46 for you earthlings thank you so much for
56:48 joining me here at the sarah carter show

00:00 strange things are going on in israel
00:02 the former head of the israeli space
00:04 security program professor
00:06 heim asher claims that there is an
00:08 agreement between the u.s government
00:10 and the aliens they signed a contract
00:13 with us to do
00:14 experiments here he also claims that the
00:17 ufos have asked not to publish that they
00:19 are here
00:20 humanity is not ready yet a secret
00:23 agreement between the us government and
00:26 aliens who are allegedly
00:27 hiding because we are not ready yet to
00:29 cope with their reality
00:31 joining me now is the former head of the
00:33 pentagon's uip research project
00:35 atip luis elizondo welcome to the show
00:38 sir
00:39 robert thank you for having me it's my
00:41 honor and privilege thank you
00:43 what's your take on this well i
00:47 i think we need a lot more information
00:48 first you know i think on one hand you
00:51 have a very credible
00:52 very respected individual who spent
00:55 decades
00:55 in the israeli space administration um
00:58 you know really achieving
01:00 nothing less than than the very very
01:02 highest position
01:03 uh in that organization so this is an
01:06 individual who is used to
01:07 classified programs um running technical
01:10 operations um
01:12 in in orbit around our planet so on one
01:15 hand
01:16 if there was ever a person that was
01:17 qualified to make such a mis
01:19 such a statement it would seem to be
01:21 someone like him and of his caliber but
01:23 of course
01:24 in the same respect you know my
01:26 background coming from from the
01:28 intelligence world
01:29 is is extraordinary claims require
01:31 extraordinary evidence right
01:33 and these are our very bold claims um
01:36 and i'm not certainly one to to throw
01:39 rocks at anybody because three years ago
01:41 when i came out with my claims about the
01:42 program and a tip and whatnot
01:44 people probably reacted very similar
01:46 like what the heck is going on
01:49 so um but but i got to tell you when
01:52 someone says that there's a
01:53 signed or written contract between the
01:55 u.s and quote-unquote
01:57 uh extraterrestrial life um
02:00 you know contracts are kind of a human
02:02 thing uh we we sign contracts if uh
02:06 you know we want certain goods and
02:07 services or we want to buy a house or
02:09 something like that
02:10 um i'm not sure that if there is
02:13 a a very sophisticated uh let's say
02:16 alien life form out in our in our
02:17 universe
02:18 that they necessarily would would oblige
02:22 to
02:22 to contractual agreements like like we
02:24 do as human beings um that seems to be
02:26 more of a human type
02:27 type mechanism frankly um again not not
02:31 really knowing what what this individual
02:33 knows
02:34 um for me i think it's um it's
02:37 it's it's certainly a fantastical claim
02:40 that we should probably try to find out
02:43 more
02:43 information about but also i will say in
02:47 in in reality um you if
02:50 you have a president like our pres
02:52 current president trump right now with
02:54 information
02:55 about something like this that can
02:57 affect humanity um when you look at this
02:59 from a practical perspective right this
03:01 is a president who is
03:03 in the throes of trying to to if you
03:06 will
03:06 protest uh the the recent election
03:09 results
03:10 and is trying to find any type of
03:12 mechanism
03:13 to to to challenge the results
03:17 one would think that this would
03:18 certainly be at the very top of the list
03:21 um if if such a contract did exist
03:23 between our government
03:24 and an extraterrestrial life form would
03:27 be used
03:28 um to to inform the people of the world
03:31 right
03:31 um this is this is a this is a really
03:33 big deal
03:34 um you know it's it's for me i'm not
03:38 qualified
03:39 to to answer on behalf of this
03:41 individual uh this highly respected
03:43 individual from israel i will tell you
03:45 that
03:45 the israeli military is extremely
03:48 capable the
03:49 israeli government uh is extremely
03:51 sophisticated
03:53 so uh in many cases they have just the
03:55 same type of technology
03:56 and and capabilities we have so
04:00 i i wouldn't want to diminish his claim
04:03 saying that you know this is not real
04:07 but you need to have some evidence just
04:08 like us with atip we had to have videos
04:10 we had to have senator reid we had to
04:12 have documentations and memorandums
04:13 official memorandums being released to
04:15 the public that they could see for
04:16 themselves and say yeah this is
04:18 this is a legitimate effort and this is
04:19 real um i think
04:21 i think that's i think that's we're at
04:23 right now i think
04:24 a lot of people are ready to believe but
04:26 but we we collectively
04:28 need to see more evidence if if someone
04:30 wants us to take that leap of faith in
04:33 then i think we need to have the
04:34 empirical data to back up those claims
04:36 and those statements
04:38 so you never heard of any secret
04:40 agreement between your government
04:42 and some alleged space aliens during
04:45 your career as the atip
04:46 boss in you know there was always this
04:50 this lore this myth that would circulate
04:52 sometimes
04:53 uh and every so often you'd hear
04:56 something hey you know
04:57 did we have an agreement uh with with
05:00 some other type of life form
05:01 to my knowledge i was never made aware
05:04 of that i was never privy to that
05:06 uh we did have access to a lot of
05:07 different organizations in the united
05:09 states government
05:10 and not at one time was i provided
05:12 definitive proof that there is some sort
05:14 of official
05:15 agreement between some other life form
05:18 and and us here on earth

04:52 sometimes
04:53 uh and every so often you'd hear
04:56 something hey you know
04:57 did we have an agreement uh with with
05:00 some other type of life form
05:01 to my knowledge i was never made aware
05:04 of that i was never privy to that
05:06 uh we did have access to a lot of
05:07 different organizations in the united
05:09 states government
05:10 and not at one time was i provided
05:12 definitive proof that there is some sort
05:14 of official
05:15 agreement between some other life form
05:18 and and us here on earth and i'll tell
05:21 you
05:22 what makes it problematic for me
05:25 if there is such an agreement where
05:28 where our government has allowed other
05:31 uh
05:32 organisms to interfere with the lives
05:35 and livelihood of
05:36 american citizens uh and again i can
05:38 only speak for for the united states
05:40 really
05:40 not not the rest of the world um
05:43 and in that agreement somehow it allows
05:46 somebody
05:47 to take a u.s citizen against their own
05:51 volition
05:52 anywhere uh or or worse even even
05:55 you know potentially touch them that's
05:57 that from my definition that's called
05:59 assault that's a crime
06:00 or if you take somebody somewhere and
06:02 they're not asking to be taken there
06:04 that's called kidnapping um so i i would
06:07 find it very difficult
06:09 for any government to permit its
06:11 citizens to be
06:13 uh if if you will taken or
06:16 or experimented on um
06:20 to me that's that's awfully high risk uh
06:22 if that ever were to get out that that
06:24 indeed was the situation
06:26 i think we'd have a lot bigger problems
06:27 on our hands right now than just
06:29 just uh you know alien life forms
06:32 but do you reckon they may be conducting
06:34 experiments without the consent of your
06:37 government well i
06:40 i don't know and then again you know
06:41 that asks the that begs the bigger
06:43 question does the united states have the
06:45 right to speak
06:45 on behalf of other nations and it
06:47 doesn't no the answer is is emphatically
06:49 no
06:50 so even if there was some sort of
06:51 agreement between the united states
06:52 government and and some sort of
06:54 life form out there in our cosmos that
06:56 does not give
06:57 us the right to speak on behalf of the
06:59 rest of humanity um
07:01 you know we can only speak on behalf of
07:02 our own people so
07:04 again i it's it's there's a lot of
07:07 questions
07:07 um that i think need to be to be
07:10 answered
07:11 um again i i'm not gonna say yes or no
07:14 either way because
07:15 i i don't know and you know of course
07:19 my my gut might tell me one thing um but
07:22 you know i've been wrong before
07:23 uh you know we've we've had this
07:25 conversation robert you and i you've
07:26 pointed out things where
07:28 where i've said something that was
07:29 inaccurate uh not intentionally but i
07:31 may have misstated something
07:32 and so i you know i've being a human
07:35 being i've
07:36 i've been wrong before so i i can't i
07:38 can't come out here and tell you
07:40 emphatically and empirically yes this
07:42 this is either
07:43 factual or it is false um i i think we
07:47 need more information i think we need to
07:48 to ask some some direct questions and
07:51 and hopefully uh our friend in israel
07:53 will be be
07:54 uh forthcoming with some answers um are
07:56 you going to get in touch with them
08:00 uh i prefer not to answer that question
08:02 at this moment
08:03 okay okay okay but still
08:06 the question remains as for the
08:08 experiments i mean i think in the last
08:09 episode of series 2 of unidentified
08:12 on the histories channel you were
08:13 talking about abduction so is this
08:15 something you're taking
08:17 seriously or you've been taking
08:19 seriously during atip
08:20 as well well i mean anytime you have
08:23 human interaction with anything you know
08:25 one of the observables that we really
08:26 didn't talk about much was the sixth
08:28 observable and that was biological
08:30 effects
08:31 any technical device in the environment
08:33 will will affect the environment
08:35 so whether it's a a a jet
08:38 aircraft on the tarmac ready to take off
08:41 uh
08:42 and uh you have that acoustic signature
08:44 or you have
08:45 perhaps a helicopter landing in a field
08:47 and it pushes the grass down
08:49 technology always has some sort of
08:51 effect on the environment
08:52 and that environment includes biological
08:54 organisms whether it's
08:55 plants or animals or human beings and so
08:59 the question in a tip was was there a
09:00 way to measure
09:03 the the impact or the effect
09:06 uaps have on biological organisms
09:09 okay um and then of course when you go
09:12 down that rabbit hole one of those
09:13 biological organisms we're naturally
09:15 concerned with or
09:16 are human organisms is the human being
09:19 the human species
09:20 and so if we are coming up close and
09:24 personal to these things whether it's
09:25 our pilots or brave men and women in
09:27 uniform or even
09:29 average citizens um is there a
09:33 negative consequence or potentially
09:35 positive consequence
09:36 uh that that that can be expected
09:39 when a biological organism like a human
09:42 being
09:42 comes close to one of these uaps um
09:45 so that that's a legitimate question you
09:47 know we
09:48 we have issues all the time with uh for
09:51 example right now with our
09:52 our service members um there is a class
09:55 action lawsuit because
09:56 the the hearing protection that were
09:58 provided to our service members
10:00 in combat were faulty and it was causing
10:02 hearing loss right well
10:03 that is a biological effect uh of a
10:07 of an acoustic um signature
10:10 in this case the the the firing of a
10:12 weapon so
10:13 you know we we are we are ourselves
10:16 sensors we are intelligence sensors as
10:18 biological organisms we touch we taste
10:20 we smell we hear we feel
10:22 and through these senses we can
10:24 ascertain
10:26 uh a better picture of our environment
10:29 of the world that we live in so is it
10:32 possible that we can use those same
10:33 senses to help us
10:34 better understand uaps and so that was a
10:37 legitimate area of study
10:39 now the question is to abductions
10:41 there's a big leap between
10:43 going from biological effects that are
10:46 inadvertent
10:47 and just a consequence of you being next
10:49 to one of these
10:50 these technologies and a deliberate
10:54 attempt to
10:55 remove somebody against their will take
10:58 them to a certain location
11:00 do things to them without their consent
11:02 and then take them back
11:04 um abduction by my definition as a
11:06 former
11:07 former special agent uh is it's a crime
11:10 it's illegal you know it's abduction is
11:13 is kidnapping
11:14 um it's it's it's something that we need
11:17 to take very very seriously and so
11:19 even if you were to let's say hop into
11:21 an uber ride
11:23 today uh to go down the street to go
11:25 visit a friend but the uber driver
11:26 decides to
11:28 stop at his or her house on the way and
11:30 maybe go grab a sandwich
11:32 at a local shop and then maybe do some
11:34 do some shopping
11:36 that's still a crime because you're
11:38 being taken somewhere
11:39 against your will yeah but do you think
11:41 the aliens
11:42 you think the aliens would would really
11:45 think about whether it's a crime on our
11:47 planet
11:47 or not no no i i i don't and but you're
11:50 asking me to think from the perspective
11:52 of something that i have no
11:54 way to to
11:56 [Music]
11:57 to think uh i guess my point being is
11:59 it's it's a completely different
12:00 paradigm it's like asking
12:01 how does a monkey think or how does a
12:03 bird think or how does a snake think or
12:05 how does
12:05 you know i can only tell you from a
12:07 human perspective what i think um
12:10 for me to try to through well what would
12:12 the aliens think well
12:14 that's presuming that if there are first
12:16 of all if there are aliens and then two
12:18 do they think i mean the way we consider
12:21 thought right conscious thought may be
12:24 completely different you know computers
12:25 use binary language right
12:27 ones and zeros um they can do a lot of
12:30 interesting processes but does it
12:32 does it mean a computer can think well
12:34 until artificial intelligence came out
12:36 probably the answer was no but now we
12:38 realize that yeah maybe computers can
12:40 think so
12:42 i think it's it's it's hard for me to
12:43 try to put myself in the shoes if
12:46 they're
12:46 a if there are aliens and b what would
12:48 they quote unquote think
12:49 of course i'm not sure of course but
12:52 have you been looking at this while you
12:53 were still at atip
12:54 the abduction phenomenon have you been
12:56 have you taken note of it at least
12:59 uh i have to be very careful after how i
13:02 answer that
13:03 um a lot of people were involved in atip
13:06 it wasn't just me
13:07 and obviously with the with the
13:09 establishment of the new task force
13:11 uh some of that that that historical
13:13 data may be
13:14 be maybe being used right now um i don't
13:18 know and i don't want to do anything
13:20 that's going to jeopardize that but what
13:21 i can say
13:22 which i said for the record we were
13:23 looking at biological effects
13:25 and those biological effects includes
13:28 all sorts of different organisms whether
13:30 again you're talking about a plant or an
13:31 animal or a human being
13:34 one of my colleagues dr kit greene an
13:37 incredible human being an absolute hero
13:39 to our nation
13:40 uh spent quite a bit of time looking
13:43 into
13:43 um the validity of of that question of
13:47 biological effects
13:49 yeah all right let's move on um
13:52 there's some more and more information
13:55 seems to come out in the united states
13:56 as well
13:57 just recently uh tim mcmillan published
14:00 an article about two classified reports
14:02 issued by the new uap task force
14:05 and they allegedly contain two photos
14:07 taken by navy pilots of uap
14:09 and one of them is now published on tim
14:11 mcmillan's website which you can see
14:13 here
14:13 it is this weird object which no one
14:16 really can make any sense of
14:18 um it's published on tim mcmillan's
14:21 website thedebrief.org
14:23 i mean i reckon you already knew this
14:25 photo before it was published right
14:30 i was aware of of that photo that's
14:32 correct
14:33 okay so originally they were supposed to
14:35 uh
14:36 uh two two photos were supposed to come
14:39 out
14:39 and then uh only one of them came out
14:42 what happened
14:44 i you know i can't answer that question
14:45 you'd have to to
14:47 forward that question to uh to tim
14:49 mcmillan
14:50 um you know i i can make guesses that
14:53 maybe those photos
14:54 uh were were held back deliberately
14:56 because they may have compromised
14:59 certain uh intelligence sensors or
15:01 capabilities or sources of methods
15:03 uh maybe it was done as a courtesy to
15:05 individuals still inside the government
15:07 um you know there's there's a whole
15:10 range of possibilities why
15:12 um you know not everything is published
15:14 um
15:16 at the end uh i think it probably comes
15:18 down to respect
15:20 um you know you we want to be
15:22 constructive in this conversation not
15:23 destructive we're not
15:25 we're not looking to to get anybody
15:27 fired or get anybody in trouble we're
15:29 just trying to
15:30 to tell the truth um and provide a
15:33 narrative that is accurate
15:35 and sometimes in doing that you know you
15:37 you have to be cautious because
15:40 there are other things at play there's
15:41 other things going on um
15:43 that you know we say well i want to see
15:46 a picture of a ufo well
15:47 the question is you know where was this
15:50 photo taken
15:51 what were we doing in that area even for
15:54 example
15:54 uh the time of day or night that a
15:57 photograph was taken
15:58 um these these are important aspects to
16:02 intelligence operations
16:03 and sometimes you don't want to to um
16:08 you don't want to broadcast those
16:09 capabilities especially because
16:11 you know foreign adversaries may be
16:12 watching so yeah um
16:15 your colleague christopher mellon from
16:16 the to the stars academy he's the former
16:18 deputy assistant secretary of defense
16:20 for intelligence he
16:21 uh conveyed a message via james fox on
16:24 the latest
16:24 uh joe rogan show in which he said
16:28 that the government should declassify or
16:32 should
16:32 release this photo because it was taken
16:36 by an uh navy pilot with his iphone so
16:39 there are no sources and methods to be
16:40 protected
16:42 do you agree well you know i i look my
16:45 my friend chris mellon is
16:47 is probably one of the most intelligent
16:49 human beings and i mean this sincerely i
16:51 have
16:52 ever had the the privilege to know uh
16:55 he he is he's an incredible incredible
16:58 human being
16:59 um i i agree with chris
17:02 um on a lot of things and this may be
17:05 one of them but i also think it's
17:06 important that we have a
17:08 a comprehensive picture of
17:11 of of of where we are right now so let's
17:13 let's take that
17:14 that example of taking an iphone where
17:17 it is a commercial product
17:19 there are no sources of methods you need
17:21 to be worried about well
17:22 a few years ago here in the united
17:24 states there was a an individual who
17:27 was in the navy and took a picture with
17:30 their personal cell phone device
17:31 again an unclassified device inside a
17:34 nuclear submarine
17:35 and in that picture were a lot of
17:38 classified
17:39 aspects so even though the device itself
17:43 may not be classified
17:46 it doesn't stop an unclassified uh
17:49 if you will um phone or machine or a
17:53 camera
17:54 from taking some very sensitive very
17:56 classified pictures
17:57 so i think we need to make make a a
18:00 determination here you know it's not so
18:01 much
18:02 what was the device that took the photos
18:04 it was what was in those photos
18:07 that that that is considered sensitive
18:10 or classified and so there is a
18:11 distinction there
18:12 and you know i think i think it's uh
18:16 tempting for us to just say well those
18:18 on an iphone we can put the picture out
18:20 there and in most cases that may
18:22 absolutely be true
18:23 but there are some exceptions as rare as
18:26 they may be there are some exceptions
18:28 and
18:29 you know we have to we have to let the
18:30 government do its job if they determine
18:32 something is classified then
18:34 you know we i think what we can do is we
18:36 can ask the question why
18:38 why is something classified i think i
18:40 think the government is enjoying to tell
18:41 us that
18:42 but to actually release every photo
18:44 that's ever been taken from a personal
18:46 camera
18:47 uh you know
18:50 that may be a a a bridge too far if i go
18:53 to a
18:53 a nuclear facility with a with a
18:55 personal cell phone device and i started
18:57 taking pictures
18:58 chances are i'm going to get my cell
18:59 phone confiscated um
19:02 that's just the world we live in yeah
19:03 yeah
19:05 your colleague christopher mellon also
19:06 said in that message
19:09 read by james fox that one of these
19:12 cases featured a photo of a bizarre
19:13 flying sphere and a black
19:15 cube inside that is identical to dozens
19:18 of other reports
19:19 by navy pilots and that these strange
19:22 objects had been shadowing east coast
19:25 naval ops since 2015. can you confirm
19:28 that
19:30 um i can confirm that uh this is nothing
19:33 new
19:34 um our our our brave men and women in
19:36 the skies have been
19:38 reporting strange things for a while uh
19:41 and there seems to be an interesting um
19:45 classification if you will of shapes
19:49 whether they're cubed or saucer or
19:52 lenticular
19:52 if you will or in some cases tic tac
19:55 shape
19:56 or cigar shaped and even triangles um
19:59 you know this this is nothing new to us
20:01 or our pilots have been reporting this
20:02 and not just pilots too there's other
20:04 individuals on the ground that have
20:06 have also reported this type of of uh
20:09 of information uh including in this
20:11 particular case
20:12 there's the sphere inside the cube yeah
20:14 what about this specific
20:16 uh shape of a sphere
20:19 and a cube inside a sphere isn't that
20:22 exactly what uh
20:23 two other navy pilots reported what was
20:25 flying
20:26 right in the middle through there in
20:28 between of their jets
20:30 yeah that's that's correct this this is
20:32 a shape that's uh been reported um
20:36 quite a bit i don't want to say how much
20:38 because you know obviously that that
20:39 changes every day
20:40 but uh it has been reported and it's
20:43 something that's um
20:44 it's very intriguing right um i think
20:46 when you look at geometry
20:48 everything we do in aerospace all our
20:50 aircraft even our stealth aircraft that
20:52 we have
20:53 they're designed specific for the
20:54 function in which they're to perform
20:56 um so a stealth aircraft has all these
20:58 weird angles and
21:00 uh it's to to if you will to evade radar
21:03 um so the question here is what what are
21:06 the advantages
21:07 of having a sphere inside a cube now is
21:10 there a very
21:11 real terrestrial answer to this could
21:13 this be some sort of new type of um
21:16 durable or balloon it's absolutely
21:18 possible
21:20 but the question is what what what
21:23 what purpose does that shape serve and
21:26 if it's not ours then whose is it and if
21:30 it's not
21:31 some sort of adversarial technology then
21:34 then we're stuck with a hard question of
21:35 okay if it's not ours and it's not
21:37 theirs then whose is it
21:38 and why what's what's the purpose of of
21:41 if you will a sphere within a cube now
21:43 that's what our eyes are seeing
21:45 and that's what the the cameras are
21:47 picking up but
21:49 is there more to it is there is there
21:51 function if you will
21:52 behind the shape and i would submit to
21:54 you in
21:55 a tip that was one of the things we're
21:56 looking at does does sh
21:58 does the shape of a uap dictate its
22:01 purpose
22:02 its function its mission so to speak is
22:04 it reconnaissance right is it
22:06 is it something else and what did you
22:08 find out
22:11 um i think the jury is still out i think
22:14 we're we're still
22:15 still trying to figure that out okay but
22:17 is it the case that specific shapes of
22:20 uap or whatever you call them only show
22:22 up in specific regions or primarily in
22:24 specific regions like christopher mellon
22:27 he mentioned that they overshadowed the
22:31 naval ops at the east coast of the
22:33 united states
22:35 and not just there they were seen way
22:38 out in in in the combat
22:40 theater uh there there are some
22:42 congruencies that we have noticed
22:45 um the question is is are those
22:47 congruencies
22:49 real or are they just because uh the
22:51 fact that we happen to
22:52 be there at the time to witness it so
22:54 what do i mean by that well
22:55 i can share with you the two
22:56 congruencies that we we're fairly
22:58 confident with
22:59 is water uh there seems to be some sort
23:02 of association with with water
23:04 and the other one is a nuclear strategic
23:08 nuclear capabilities whether it's energy
23:10 or weapon development or whatever
23:13 we do seem to see that a lot now the
23:16 question is
23:17 is there really an interest by uaps in
23:21 water for whatever reason and us nuclear
23:23 technology and foreign nuclear
23:25 technology
23:26 or is it that we have more eyes if you
23:28 will more people watching those areas
23:30 right so one could
23:32 one could could i think argue the fact
23:34 that a
23:35 nuclear facility is probably one of the
23:37 more guarded
23:38 locations that we have in in our
23:41 countries
23:42 uh and for good reason right and so
23:44 because of that you're gonna have more
23:45 technology more capability
23:47 looking for things in the sky looking
23:49 for potential threats
23:51 so is it possible that we just have more
23:54 capabilities more
23:55 quote unquote eyes in the sky near these
23:57 facilities
23:58 and we're seeing them more often uh same
24:01 thing with water you have the navy which
24:03 is literally
24:04 all over the world um they are a global
24:07 presence
24:08 so is it possible that they are are
24:11 seeing these things more frequently just
24:13 because they happen to be more places
24:15 that are in the middle of the ocean that
24:17 happen to be remote where the sky is
24:19 very clear
24:20 or uh is there really a congruency
24:23 between uaps and water and
24:26 nuclear capabilities um i will share
24:29 with you which i don't usually do
24:31 but it is my opinion and let me let me
24:34 re-emphasize this
24:35 it is my personal opinion that there is
24:39 certainly an interest in strategic
24:42 nuclear capabilities
24:44 the methodology in which we see these
24:46 uaps
24:48 um conduct their their operations if you
24:52 will
24:53 um is very uh similar to the way we
24:56 ourselves would conduct some sort of
24:58 reconnaissance mission
24:59 so i from my perspective i think it's
25:03 fair to say
25:03 almost conclusively that there is
25:05 definitely a
25:08 there is some sort of relationship
25:09 between strategic nuclear capabilities
25:11 and uap sightings now the question is
25:14 is that the same thing with water and
25:16 that's why the navy is seeing all these
25:18 things and the air force has been kind
25:19 of quiet
25:20 i don't know that i don't know we have
25:22 some theories on why
25:25 why that may be the case there's
25:27 certainly a lot of indicators that is
25:29 that is uh indicative that that may be
25:32 the case
25:34 but i think it's harder to be definitive
25:36 uh from that perspective it is something
25:38 that a tip looked at
25:39 a lot you know why is it we see these
25:41 things over the bodies of water
25:43 you know often and uh is is there a is
25:46 there a purpose and
25:48 and so that was fear rise quite a bit
25:50 and that's a very good question uh there
25:52 have been theories before
25:54 where do they come from the
25:55 extraterrestrial hypothesis the
25:57 interdimensional hypothesis the time
25:59 traveler hypothesis but
26:01 if they show up here more regularly um
26:03 and
26:04 more often in specific locations
26:06 wouldn't it be logical
26:08 to assume that they have a base on earth
26:10 somewhere hidden
26:11 maybe deep down in the water
26:14 could be uh it could also be that water
26:17 is being used as a fuel source
26:18 it could be as simple as uh we are a uh
26:22 a close uh gas station nearby
26:26 uh an esso if you will or a mobile gas
26:28 station
26:29 um you know it could be that potentially
26:32 water is being used as a fuel source
26:33 right if you wanted to to we know that
26:36 the smaller
26:37 you go in size and matter the more
26:41 tightly energy is is held within those
26:46 within those bonds of matter so when you
26:48 go from
26:49 for example water to steam that's a one
26:52 times ten to the third energy release
26:54 when you start breaking apart the
26:55 molecules you get into a chemical
26:57 reaction that's usually one times ten to
26:58 the fourth release of energy
27:00 then you get into splitting up the atom
27:03 that's one times ten to the fifth then
27:05 you starting the
27:06 nucleus of an atom that's a one times 10 27:08 to the sixth release
27:09 and so forth and so forth so one could
27:12 argue that
27:12 you know the the most fundamental
27:14 element in the universe the most
27:15 abundant
27:16 and widely distributed is hydrogen the
27:19 problem is let's just
27:21 say for argument's sake that your
27:23 vehicle requires
27:26 a lot of energy to to bend space-time
27:29 well
27:30 if you needed a lot of energy you would
27:32 have to break down
27:33 matter to a point to get extract some of
27:36 that energy
27:37 is it possible that hydrogen is being
27:40 used
27:41 to to to create those
27:44 levels of energy breaking down hydrogen
27:46 and i don't mean hydrogen
27:48 even the atom i mean the more
27:50 fundamental aspects the proton if you
27:52 will and the neutron perhaps
27:54 uh and then maybe even even even smaller
27:56 than that and
27:57 so one could argue that although
27:59 hydrogen is the most abundant it's also
28:01 the most diffuse in our in our
28:02 cosmos meaning it's it's it's almost
28:05 nebulous
28:06 usually you have to go to a to a huge
28:08 gas cloud
28:10 to find hydrogen in that type of
28:11 abundance the other other place where
28:13 you can find hydrogen
28:15 in great quantities is water h2o
28:18 it turns out that water is is one of the
28:21 most
28:21 um hydrogen-rich
28:25 sources in the universe because it's
28:27 bonded to oxygen
28:28 so if you wanted to to mine
28:33 hydrogen maybe maybe you would do it you
28:35 know
28:36 uh using using water and just remove the
28:39 oxygen that leaves you two hydrogens and
28:41 you know you're you're in business again
28:43 and i want to be clear here this is
28:45 this is just purely speculative right
28:47 now um
28:48 you know you asked me a question so uh i
28:50 wanted to to try to answer it
28:52 answer it thoughtfully uh but it is
28:55 speculative at this point so i don't
28:57 want anybody thinking that hey lou has
28:58 said that
28:59 you know they're mining water and that's
29:00 you know the earth is a gas station
29:03 i don't know it's just simply a a
29:07 counter
29:08 counterpoint to to your question so what
29:10 so what is the reason in your opinion
29:12 that
29:12 you have that there are real ufo hot
29:15 spots that they
29:16 seem to show up in specific locations
29:18 catalina island the us east coast
29:20 and all of that well i i think if you
29:24 if you look at this in terms of what's
29:27 around those areas
29:28 right first of all catalina island at
29:32 the time you had a nuclear strike
29:34 group you had a nuclear-powered aircraft
29:36 carrier
29:37 uh potentially nuclear-powered and
29:39 nuclear-armed submarines
29:41 in the area potentially you also have a
29:44 uh
29:44 a uh old uh older nuclear power plant
29:47 right off the coast there
29:48 uh in in north of san diego
29:52 so is it really catalina is a hot spot
29:55 because it's
29:55 it's a you know a pretty island or is it
29:58 because that there may be some
29:59 capabilities there that
30:01 uh a uap might find interesting so let's
30:03 let's look at the east coast of the
30:04 united states
30:05 same thing um you know you have a lot of
30:08 um
30:08 [Music]
30:10 facilities there that are very sensitive
30:12 uh and
30:13 in some cases related to to our our
30:16 nuclear capabilities and i'll leave it
30:18 at that i won't go any more detail than
30:19 that
30:20 so the question is um is there an
30:22 interest
30:23 in the west coast of the east coast just
30:25 simply because the west coast and the
30:27 east coast
30:28 or is there something there that is
30:29 drawing uap activity
30:32 uh that they're interested in right and
30:34 that may be a global thing not just the
30:35 u.s this may be the same thing they've
30:37 seen in china
30:38 and in russia and in europe and
30:39 everywhere else
30:41 and for that reason it's it's a very
30:43 scary topic to talk about as a
30:44 government the last thing you want to do
30:46 is
30:47 is discuss any type of vulnerability you
30:48 may have in your strategic
30:50 nuclear capability either to to either
30:53 offensive or defensive
30:54 um that's just something we don't
30:56 discuss publicly ever
30:58 no matter what so um there could be some
31:01 some sensitivities there as well
31:03 why why there's this hesitation this
31:06 resistance
31:07 to talk about uaps off the east and west
31:10 coast of the united states
31:11 because maybe there's some sensitivities
31:14 surrounding those
31:15 those particular areas yeah let's talk
31:17 about the uap
31:18 task force which was uh formally
31:21 introduced a couple of months ago
31:24 by the defense deputy defense minister
31:27 of your country but you say it already
31:30 existed before and had been working
31:33 ever since you left atip well it was an
31:36 official
31:37 release but not uh not the formal
31:41 release
31:41 uh the the the task force has been
31:43 around for for some time
31:45 it really is a natural evolution of atip
31:48 i think when people find out and i say
31:50 this
31:50 i think from an informed perspective
31:54 i'm not going to say why but it'll
31:55 become abundantly clear i think in the
31:57 near future
31:59 when people realize the similarities
32:02 between the uap task force and atip
32:04 um no big surprise there uh
32:07 i think it's you know why reinvent the
32:09 wheel when you can take the lessons
32:11 learned from other
32:12 other past efforts and incorporate them
32:14 into your existing efforts
32:16 um it is it is something that has been
32:19 going on for some time
32:20 um the individuals who are part of that
32:23 organization
32:24 are are some of the most capable that
32:26 i've had
32:27 i've ever had a chance to work with
32:29 unfortunately there's not a lot of them
32:31 there needs to be more the task force
32:33 was established which i think was an
32:35 excellent sign i applaud senator marco
32:38 rubio and of course
32:39 senator harry reid and some of these
32:41 other individuals who who support the
32:43 task force and the establishment of the
32:44 task force
32:45 um the problem is it's it's not nearly
32:48 as robust as it should be
32:49 um and it needs to have more people that
32:52 needs to have more money
32:53 um you know you you can only do so much
32:56 with
32:56 with with a certain number of people
32:59 yeah it's only two people right
33:02 yes uh formally
33:06 two people there's actually more
33:07 involved um quite a few more
33:10 just like we had an a tip i think if you
33:11 looked at those individuals who were
33:14 part of a tip you look at that original
33:15 list of 13 or i guess
33:16 maybe 20 people back in 2009 33:20 uh my name being included as one of
33:22 those individuals
33:23 it's not a whole lot of people but when
33:25 you realize actually we had a whole lot
33:27 of other people working with us
33:28 um you know it's it's it's a little bit
33:31 more
33:32 more than that i think when you look at
33:33 a formal line of block chart you might
33:35 see two people
33:36 but there's there's more people helping
33:38 that cause a lot more the problem is
33:40 that it's that they're at the whim of
33:42 the government so if the government says
33:43 you know what
33:44 we have this other issue du jour we want
33:46 you to work on they're going to get
33:48 pulled from that mission of looking at
33:49 uaps
33:50 to go do something else and you don't
33:53 have that
33:53 dedicated support that's necessary
33:55 especially in a topic like this
33:57 so um you know i think i think they
34:00 they need a lot more a lot more help a
34:03 lot more support i mean we had
34:05 a lot some some folks in atip and we
34:08 didn't have enough
34:09 people to do what we needed to do so i
34:11 can't imagine the current uap task force
34:13 commander
34:14 um having a whole lot of time to do very
34:16 much you know if it's just him and one
34:18 other person that's uh
34:20 that'd be tough yeah so are you are you
34:23 waiting
34:23 are they waiting for the intelligence
34:25 authorization act to come into power
34:27 to to be effective in order to receive
34:30 funding
34:31 or what is it that takes sure that's
34:33 that's one mechanism
34:34 uh but there's other mechanisms and my
34:37 colleagues like chris and i have been
34:38 very busy
34:39 uh behind the scenes trying to to create
34:41 an environment where
34:42 if that funding does not happen that
34:44 there are
34:46 other um potentially funding vehicles
34:49 um you know part of that is engaging key
34:52 government personnel
34:54 uh and and letting them know the reality
34:57 of the topic
34:58 in a very serious straightforward way
35:00 sometimes you know
35:01 they have to have classified briefings
35:03 to see data and at that point once
35:05 they're convinced then usually they get
35:07 energized
35:08 um you know and i i think there's people
35:11 think it's just a matter of
35:12 congressional funding and you're going
35:13 to have this task force
35:14 there's other mechanisms to to
35:16 accomplish this um ideally what we'd
35:18 want to do is take it from being a task
35:20 force
35:21 to a long-term effort that either
35:24 resides within the intelligence
35:26 community or the department of defense
35:28 a task force legally speaking uh
35:31 is usually a temporary activity or
35:33 effort
35:34 to solve an immediate problem um and in
35:37 this particular case
35:38 uh i you know we we may be looking at
35:40 this um
35:41 this may be a long-term problem for us
35:43 long-term challenge not
35:44 not a not necessarily a short-term
35:46 challenge uh
35:48 frank we've been looking at this problem
35:49 for decades and we still haven't figured
35:51 it out so
35:52 so maybe a task force isn't the best
35:53 construct it's a great way to start the
35:55 ball rolling but
35:56 i think long term this is gonna we're
35:58 gonna need a lot more in fact i think
36:00 it's gonna be an international effort i
36:01 think
36:02 we really need our our friends in other
36:04 countries we just saw japan step up to
36:06 the plate thank goodness
36:07 we have other other friends in latin
36:08 america that are willing to step up to
36:10 the plate a couple
36:11 a couple friends in europe um i'm not
36:14 prepared to say who they are right now
36:15 but that are also willing to step up to
36:16 the plate and
36:17 and maybe this is a big maybe but maybe
36:20 even in the middle east there may be a
36:21 country or two that that's interested in
36:23 this topic
36:24 um so i i think ultimately this is going
36:27 to be a collective challenge for all of
36:29 us to try to figure out this shouldn't
36:30 be just a u.s
36:31 issue or a u.s problem this is truly a
36:34 it's a global presence and therefore a
36:36 global
36:37 global issue we all need to know how to
36:38 figure this is that the reason why those
36:40 uap reports were widely distributed
36:43 among
36:44 the in the intelligence community in the
36:46 five eyes community even allies
36:50 um i think that's a pretty good safe bet
36:55 okay okay so we can also we we can all
36:58 think about who that
36:59 uh interested party in europe may be
37:03 um so um when it comes to allies
37:07 i mean germany hosts one of the biggest
37:10 u.s military bases outside the u.s
37:14 do you think one of those reports would
37:16 also reach
37:17 some responsible person in germany
37:20 you know i hope so ultimately uh the
37:23 german response to this is up to
37:25 up to you not me it's going to be up to
37:28 to folks like you who
37:30 carry the torch and and have a
37:32 conversation in a in a rational
37:34 meaningful way
37:36 that it resonates with your leadership
37:38 um this this topic has been
37:41 been um clouded far too long in stigma
37:44 and taboo
37:45 and partly because the individuals
37:48 involved in this
37:49 this effort you know there's been a lot
37:51 of controversy
37:53 there hasn't been a whole lot of facts
37:54 and a whole lot of opinions that have
37:56 been
37:56 provided so you know politicians are
37:58 very by by design
38:00 risk averse in fact a lot of times they
38:03 stay
38:04 they stay in in their positions because
38:06 they avoid these type of
38:07 of of social you know if you will uh
38:10 conflicts
38:10 uh and ideas so in order to
38:14 get a a leader to pay attention you have
38:18 to first have a conversation in a way
38:20 that makes sense uh we don't talk about
38:23 you know
38:24 little green men and elvis on the
38:25 mothership and tin foil hats because
38:28 unfortunately
38:29 this is this is a mental picture we have
38:32 done to ourselves over the last 70 years
38:35 this is a topic that has been relegated
38:37 to to
38:38 for the most part fringe science and
38:41 that's problematic because this isn't
38:43 french science this is probably just
38:44 quantum mechanics but we haven't been
38:46 able to have a good conversation about
38:47 it because people the first thing you do
38:49 when you mention it
38:50 they kind of smile they might grin they
38:52 might raise their eyebrow
38:54 and that's because of the social
38:55 conditioning that
38:57 we have we have placed on this topic for
38:59 decades
39:01 um it's almost reflexive um in fact if
39:03 you don't have a reaction like that
39:05 people will start to think you're crazy
39:07 right so so you have to first remove
39:09 that stigma and that taboo from the
39:11 conversation
39:12 and to do that um you know it takes
39:16 it takes it takes a a a hard
39:18 conversation with
39:19 evidence and proof and you know when you
39:23 ask the german government or the german
39:24 military and we did that twice in a
39:26 press conference
39:28 they will deny they would deny any
39:30 interest
39:31 in the subject whatsoever
39:34 they would even say that they never
39:36 never had anything unusual on their
39:38 radar screens
39:39 which they could not eventually explain
39:42 is that a credible statement for you
39:44 well
39:45 sure from a government absolutely
39:46 because governments are paid to have
39:48 have answers
39:49 and the last thing you want to do is
39:51 involve your government in an issue
39:53 where you don't have problems you don't
39:54 have you don't have solutions for
39:55 but you don't want to admit you have a
39:57 problem that you don't have a solution
39:59 and so
40:00 i i i don't blame
40:03 the german government or any other
40:04 government or the us government for not
40:06 wanting to get involved
40:07 i i don't want to be involved but but i
40:09 am i have to be so
40:11 for me i think it's um it's normal for a
40:14 government to say look you know unless
40:16 these things are an
40:17 absolute threat right now which they
40:18 don't potentially seem to be we don't
40:20 know
40:21 um we'll let some other country deal
40:22 with this and then when they have the
40:24 empirical evidence
40:25 and we're forced to get involved in this
40:27 then we will but until that point we're
40:29 not going to spend our own
40:30 our own money trying to solve a problem
40:33 that frankly there may not be a solution
40:35 for
40:36 and furthermore the last thing we want
40:37 to do is tell our own people that
40:39 you know we have no idea what these
40:40 things are flying in our sky um
40:42 that's a big no-no and this is something
40:45 that even in our country right now
40:47 is something that we're trying to deal
40:48 with um you know our department of
40:50 defense has prided itself on our
40:52 intelligence community for being the
40:53 best of the best of the best
40:55 and yet here is something that that has
40:58 remained a complete enigma to our entire
41:01 national security apparatus for decades
41:04 yeah yeah now let's talk about the crash
41:06 debris and the cooperation agreement
41:08 that to the stars academy has signed
41:10 with the u.s army
41:12 futures command standing used to this
41:15 analyzing ufo crash debris
41:19 unfortunately i i'm not at liberty to
41:21 discuss uh
41:22 any business involving ttsa uh and any
41:25 other organizations
41:27 outside um that it may be uh they may
41:30 have business dealings with
41:31 um that's something that i would i would
41:33 suggest probably
41:35 um you may want to inquire directly with
41:37 ttsa
41:39 okay okay so what are your future plans
41:42 um is there going to be a third series
41:45 on the history channel
41:46 what what are your plans for the next
41:48 future
41:49 well without going into a whole lot of
41:52 detail
41:52 um first and foremost chris mallon and
41:55 myself
41:56 and a few others remain very much
41:58 engaged in this topic behind the scenes
42:00 trying to uh push the ball forward um
42:04 with our with our own government our own
42:06 politicians
42:07 our own media and leadership
42:11 um but i think it would be a fair
42:13 presumption to say
42:14 um international engagement is becoming
42:17 one of our uh top priorities uh i won't
42:21 go into detail of exactly how we're
42:22 gonna do that and
42:24 and our plan for that but i think people
42:25 can start to see that shifting now that
42:27 we've got
42:28 the conversation going here in our
42:29 country i think it's time we had this
42:31 conversation occurring now more
42:33 more globally um i think uh
42:36 it wouldn't be a surprise if people saw
42:38 chris and myself
42:39 chris mellon and myself and maybe some
42:41 other people uh i will say their names
42:45 right now
42:45 uh working on some joint projects um
42:49 in the in the um in the public domain
42:52 uh maybe uh a very hard-hitting
42:56 um documentary on a global level
43:00 where we continue the work and effort
43:02 that we did with
43:03 unidentified and and
43:06 really really take this conversation
43:08 global
43:10 provide new information new evidence new
43:13 testimony
43:14 uh that will resonate not just in in our
43:17 country here but but perhaps in other
43:18 countries as well
43:19 yeah talking about conditions globally
43:22 the kovit-19 crisis
43:24 is one of them it's really
43:28 uh well engaging all of us in
43:31 wondering what the future may bring the
43:33 world economic forum has their own
43:35 agenda it's called the great reset do
43:37 you think that there is anything
43:39 how does this work out the plan what
43:41 you're doing
43:43 uh compared to or let's say um
43:46 taking into account the current
43:48 situation
43:50 you know i don't know i i i'm not much
43:52 of a conspiracy theorist
43:54 and and i'm smart enough to know what i
43:56 don't know
43:57 to know that i there are things out
43:58 there that i have no clue about
44:00 uh so um you know i i have a i have a
44:04 a difficult enough time just talking
44:06 about uaps
44:08 i'm not sure anybody's an expert i'm
44:09 certainly not an expert in it
44:11 uh even though i worked the program for
44:13 almost 10 years
44:14 still doesn't make me an expert if i was
44:16 an expert we would have figured it out
44:17 by now
44:18 so um to talk about this these other
44:20 things you know we're
44:22 we're constantly dealing with as a
44:23 society with these
44:25 these external challenges whether it's
44:27 covet and the national pandemic
44:29 or uh terrorism or uh
44:33 you know if you will economic uh
44:37 inequality as some has put it uh i think
44:40 but this is nothing new this is all part
44:41 of the human condition this is i think
44:44 you know we as a human being we live for
44:46 maybe 80 years if we're lucky and we
44:48 look at everything
44:49 through the scope of that 80 years and
44:51 we say wow times have really gotten
44:52 tough but the question is has it really
44:54 uh you know there were times in the past
44:57 where we we faced
44:58 a bubonic plague right and the black
45:00 death and spanish influenza that killed
45:03 millions and millions
45:04 of people we had great global world wars
45:07 right that killed millions of people so
45:10 you know
45:11 strife is nothing new to the human
45:13 condition and
45:14 um yeah right now things things
45:18 seem pretty bad but when you look at it
45:20 in contrast to the rest of
45:22 of where humanity has been and the path
45:25 that we have taken
45:27 it's actually not too bad i think we're
45:29 all living pretty
45:30 pretty good right now by by you know by
45:33 universal standards
45:35 can we do better absolutely yeah um do i
45:38 think that the ufo or uap
45:41 issue has anything to do with covid or
45:43 anything else i don't
45:46 um i don't think there's this grand
45:48 conspiracy in any way to try to
45:50 uh you know reset if you will
45:54 humanity there's a lot of discussion
45:56 here in our country about
45:58 this this uh thing called q anon
46:01 uh um yeah you know but again these
46:04 if you look at the the cycles or the
46:06 rhythms of humanity
46:08 it ebbs and flows like like the tides
46:11 and yeah and
46:12 these type of things come and go this is
46:14 just part of being human and and
46:16 and living on a living on a on a
46:18 collective rock we call we call earth
46:21 do you have the impression that ufo
46:23 sightings occur more
46:24 um more often in or have been occurring
46:28 more often throughout the last couple of
46:30 years
46:32 well that's a question we need to answer
46:33 right you one can say well certainly
46:35 there's more people reporting it and
46:37 and it's in the press more often so the
46:39 sightings must have gone up but in in
46:41 the other
46:42 part of the argument one could one could
46:44 argue just as easily saying well
46:46 more people now have uh personal cell
46:49 phone devices in their hands with
46:50 some of the best technology you know
46:52 this this this cell phone that i carry
46:54 here this little device
46:56 is more capable uh than some of our best
46:59 computers just 10 years ago
47:00 right so everybody has these little
47:03 intelligent sensor devices that has gps
47:05 and wi-fi and telemetry and in some
47:08 cases even infrared
47:10 uh so you know is the question you're
47:14 asking is
47:15 are ufos uh being encountered more
47:18 frequently
47:19 or are they just being reported more
47:21 frequently because everybody now has a
47:22 personal device in their hands
47:24 and frankly it's okay to have a
47:26 conversation because now the media's
47:28 picked up and said hey you know what
47:29 maybe there really is something there
47:31 and so people are now more apt to have
47:33 the conversation you know just three
47:34 years ago if you went to a commercial
47:36 pilot said hey have you ever seen a ufo
47:38 they'd say no way okay but what about
47:40 but what about military sightings i mean
47:42 i'm not talking about
47:43 some everybody everyday person who sees
47:46 some strange object from his balcony
47:48 what about military sightings
47:50 well i i think that's a that's a great
47:52 question i don't know i don't know if we
47:53 have the metrics yet to say
47:55 definitively that there is a an increase
47:58 uh in these um in these interactions you
48:00 know one can go back to world war ii
48:02 with the foo fighters
48:03 and it wasn't uncommon that our allied
48:06 pilots would would
48:07 would see these these lights following
48:10 them sometimes for for a protracted
48:12 period of time
48:13 in and out of a theater of engagement um
48:16 you know so i again i don't
48:20 i don't want to state that the frequency
48:22 is either up or down
48:23 i think it's um it's interesting to see
48:26 uh
48:27 the data come in but i think we need to
48:29 do more analysis first of all we need
48:30 more data
48:31 and then we need more analysis to figure
48:34 out is this
48:34 is this really a greater increase in
48:37 frequency of sightings or
48:39 is it just a manifestation of the fact
48:41 that we have better collection
48:42 capabilities now than we've ever had
48:43 before
48:44 yeah you know when i watched the
48:46 history's
48:47 television show of which i i took part
48:50 in this unknowingly
48:52 um uh you know one thing i i noticed was
48:56 that the ufo phenomenon was all was
48:58 often portrayed as a threat to national
49:00 security why is that i mean the uf there
49:02 have been so many ufo sightings around
49:04 the world for decades
49:06 um without that you've ever heard that
49:08 the ufo would have
49:09 attacked the white house or abducted
49:11 some president or what
49:12 what have you i mean why is it always
49:14 you know it makes
49:16 us wonder if there's some sinister goal
49:18 you're trying to achieve by
49:20 always portraying it as a as a threat so
49:23 why is that
49:24 fair question well first of all because
49:25 we're human uh we
49:27 every one of us as human beings fear the
49:29 unknown now people
49:30 say oh we i don't fear the unknown yes
49:32 you do everybody does uh we just fear it
49:34 in in different ways
49:35 from my perspective i come i'm a former
49:37 military man and intelligence officer
49:40 i fear the unknown i fear information
49:43 gaps
49:44 when you have an information gap and
49:46 you're not sharing information
49:48 things like 911 happen now i'm not
49:50 saying that
49:51 there's any comparison between 911 and
49:54 uaps what i'm simply saying is that some
49:58 small gap in information can lead to
50:00 catastrophic
50:01 failures and my job in the department of
50:05 defense was to have answers
50:07 okay i am a product of national security
50:11 otherwise i'd work at the state
50:12 department otherwise i'd work at an ngo
50:14 otherwise i'd work for the
50:16 the red cross that's not who i am my job
50:19 is to
50:20 identify and find and and get rid of bad
50:22 guys that's what we do
50:23 in national security so it should not be
50:26 of any surprise to anybody
50:28 that we look at everything through the
50:29 lens of a potential and let me emphasize
50:32 potential threat doesn't mean it is a
50:34 threat but it has a potential to be a
50:36 threat let's
50:37 let's look at the fundamental equation
50:39 of what constitutes a threat
50:40 you have to have capabilities and intent
50:43 well
50:43 we've seen some of the capabilities we
50:45 have no idea the intent
50:47 so we don't know if it's a threat but we
50:49 have to assume or presume that it could
50:51 be if it wanted to be
50:53 so from my perspective that's
50:56 that was the optic that we we looked at
50:58 um i think
51:00 you know another analogy i like to use
51:02 and you i'm sure you've probably heard
51:03 it a million times but
51:05 you know to me it makes sense i i have
51:07 two daughters and i and i love them
51:09 terribly and i'm always worried sick
51:10 about them and
51:12 i always ask him every night okay you
51:14 lock your front door okay
51:15 make sure all your windows are locked
51:16 you know you turn the alarm on before
51:18 you go to bed
51:18 because i don't want anything bad to
51:20 happen now they live in a very safe
51:22 neighborhood but bad things still happen
51:25 in nice neighborhoods and so
51:26 i always tell them lock your door and so
51:28 the analogy i like to use is let's say
51:30 one night you
51:31 you know you i know you live in a nice
51:32 neighborhood but you decide you lock
51:33 your front door
51:35 make sure the windows are locked you
51:36 turn on your alarm system and you wake
51:38 up one morning to have a nice hot cup of
51:40 tea or coffee you walk downstairs
51:42 and all of a sudden there's muddy boot
51:44 prints in your living room yeah we're
51:46 not there the night before
51:47 now no one's been hurt nothing's been
51:49 taken nothing's out of place
51:51 but despite you locking the front door
51:54 locking the windows and turning on your
51:55 alarm system the night before
51:57 there are muddy boot prints in your
51:58 living room so my question to you is
52:00 is that a threat well my response to you
52:03 is
52:04 it could be if it wanted to be so we
52:05 probably better figure it out
52:07 so that's that's my perspective and
52:09 frankly i don't want to gamble
52:11 with my daughter's well-being and i
52:13 don't want to gamble with the american
52:14 people's well-being and i don't want to
52:16 gamble with
52:17 with our our allies and our friends
52:19 well-being on a question like this we
52:20 have no idea
52:22 and then further more complicated when
52:24 people say well
52:25 these things mean no harm they haven't
52:27 you know blown up the white house
52:29 well you have some people saying well
52:30 yeah but i've got cancer
52:32 well yeah but you know i was i was taken
52:35 somewhere where i didn't want to go
52:36 well if that's true then that is a
52:39 threat
52:40 to me i would not want my daughter being
52:42 taken anywhere without her consent
52:43 period
52:44 i don't care what it's for so i think
52:47 you know i prefer not to live in in a
52:49 world of naivety
52:51 i could be absolutely wrong and i hope i
52:53 am i hope there is absolutely no threat
52:55 here this is
52:56 completely benign and all for the
52:58 benefit of humanity i truly hope
52:59 so but i don't want to take that risk
53:02 until we know for sure
53:04 so that's and i think i can i can speak
53:06 clearly for my colleagues as well now
53:08 with that said
53:10 i also think there's a lot of
53:11 opportunity i think there's a lot of
53:12 hope here
53:13 i think that if this turns out to be
53:16 what it could be the potential could be
53:19 enormous for mankind and humanity
53:21 writ large so with risk comes
53:24 opportunity
53:25 and i think we need to look at this also
53:27 through that optic
53:28 and if you notice through the through
53:30 the last episode of season two
53:32 we kind of do a little bit of a personal
53:34 monologue each of us of what what this
53:36 could mean for humanity
53:37 and it's not all bad there could be
53:39 tremendous good here
53:41 right so um i think i think we need to
53:44 proceed cautiously
53:46 remain remain optimistic but cautiously
53:48 optimistic that would be my
53:50 that would be my suggestion okay one
53:53 last question about
53:54 the role of the u.s navy jim mcmillan
53:57 put an emphasis on
53:58 cases of unidentified submerged objects
54:02 which seem to occur more often than one
54:04 would believe
54:06 so is that why is it that we hear so
54:09 seldomly about them
54:10 and uh is there any any case you can
54:13 tell us about
54:14 well first of all in the sky you can see
54:16 uh you know if something flies over your
54:18 city you can see it the ocean is a
54:19 little bit different than
54:21 much more than uh maybe 20 30 feet 40 54:24 feet in front of you
54:25 and it becomes inky blackness there's
54:28 not a whole lot to see in the ocean so
54:30 so the ocean to to to a degree is far
54:32 more mysterious than our own skies in
54:34 fact
54:35 a lot of scientists have said we know
54:36 more about the moon than we do our own
54:38 great ocean depths and so the only way
54:41 that we're going to know about our ocean
54:42 depths is through our technology
54:44 and our usually the technology coming
54:46 from our navies
54:47 they're the ones that are going to have
54:48 the best capabilities to figure out what
54:50 the heck is down there
54:52 those capabilities are very sensitive we
54:54 don't like to talk about those
54:55 capabilities
54:56 because those same capabilities we can
54:57 use to track a uap
54:59 maybe the same capabilities we use to
55:00 track a russian submarine
55:02 so for that reason i think you you
55:06 you don't really typically hear a whole
55:08 lot this is nothing new the navy never
55:10 likes to talk about its
55:11 its underwater capabilities it's it's
55:14 definitely one of the
55:15 the crown jewels if you will for our
55:17 national security
55:18 so it's no surprise that the navy is is
55:21 going to be very tight-lipped about
55:23 talking about anything
55:24 that's below the waves and not just
55:26 because of the enemy's capabilities
55:28 but our own capabilities we don't want
55:30 to broadcast or advertise
55:32 we have the capability to do certain
55:33 things and that makes sense and that's
55:35 any nation that's not just us that's
55:37 also germany
55:38 it's it's all over the world we we all
55:40 have that in common we don't want to
55:42 broadcast any type of of classified or
55:45 secret capability because
55:46 we don't want to compromise those
55:47 capabilities you're probably probably
55:49 using them so i think um i think
55:52 probably that's why
55:54 okay okay you you were talking about um
55:56 those extreme flight maneuvers of uap
55:59 uh which defier laws of physics
56:00 apparently
56:02 is that also the case underwater the the
56:05 the objects that are being registered
56:06 there do they also show
56:08 signs of do they have maneuvers or
56:13 capabilities that we don't have
56:14 underwater
56:17 yes and and that's very important
56:19 because let's
56:20 let's take this pen for a second this
56:22 pen
56:23 is uh let's say this pen is an airplane
56:26 and we as a human being we design
56:29 vehicles to operate
56:30 in the environment for which they're
56:32 going to be operating in so an airplane
56:34 naturally you have a nose
56:35 you have an engine you have a tail and
56:37 you have a rudder
56:38 and elevators and ailerons so you can
56:41 maneuver in an atmosphere
56:43 and that's why this pen looks
56:45 fundamentally different and operates
56:47 funnily
56:47 different than let's say a rocket which
56:50 isn't going to be in the atmosphere for
56:51 very long it's going to spend most of
56:53 its time in a low earth orbit
56:55 in a vacuum environment so it doesn't
56:56 need wings it can't use a jet engine
56:59 doesn't have a cockpit what it has is
57:01 chemical rocket engines it has
57:03 thrusters to maneuver and when you
57:05 compare a rocket to a submarine which is
57:07 underwater right
57:09 a submarine is neither an airplane or a
57:12 rocket it doesn't have a jet engine it
57:14 doesn't have a rocket edge and it has a
57:15 propeller
57:16 and it uses buoyancy uh to to go up and
57:19 down
57:20 and so that's that's how it maneuvers
57:22 and so you my point being is you don't
57:24 expect an airplane
57:26 to operate just as well underwater as a
57:29 submarine because they're two entirely
57:30 different environments
57:32 for which you need different
57:33 technologies to operate now
57:35 there are some rare occasions where we
57:36 can take an airplane
57:38 and we can compromise an airplane and
57:39 also make it a boat we call them
57:41 seaplanes
57:42 but a seaplane is neither a very good
57:44 airplane nor it is a ver
57:45 nor is it a very good boat it's always
57:48 it's always a design compromise if you
57:50 want to operate more than one
57:51 environment
57:52 well these are things that we are seeing
57:54 operating in our atmosphere
57:56 and in our potentially low earth
57:58 environment and even underwater
58:00 yet they can perform the same way that
58:03 they do in other environments but they
58:04 haven't had to change their design
58:06 characteristics so
58:07 so that for us is is a game changer
58:10 that's
58:10 that's that is hugely important what
58:14 that would be like taking a volkswagen
58:16 car
58:17 and all of a sudden now um being
58:20 able to uh let's say uh
58:24 go climb mount everest with it right and
58:25 then turn around and become a formula
58:27 one race car
58:28 and win a formula one race and then turn
58:30 around and uh
58:31 maybe use it as a boat and uh you know
58:34 take it on a vacation on a lake
58:36 it's you wouldn't expect that and that's
58:39 yet
58:40 that's precisely what we're seeing can
58:42 you imagine that any military in the
58:43 world would not be
58:45 interested in acquiring this kind of
58:47 technology
58:49 of course this is why this is a military
58:52 problem
58:53 the last thing you want to do is have
58:54 this technology in the hands of an
58:55 unfriendly country you're absolutely
58:57 correct
58:58 and that's another layer that
58:59 complicates this entire topic because
59:01 there are very valid strategic and
59:03 tactical advantages to this technology
59:05 if you can acquire it
59:07 okay my last question and i promise is
59:09 the last one
59:10 what do you think what do you think
59:12 would change
59:13 for mankind if we really were to
59:15 understand we are not alone
59:17 we have never we have possibly never
59:19 been alone we may
59:21 live on this planet together with some
59:23 other species or they may be visiting us
59:26 what do you think would happen
59:28 on a society level on a political level
59:31 well first of all
59:33 we've already answered that question
59:34 every day first of all we're not alone
59:36 on this planet
59:38 life is abundant on this planet it's
59:40 everywhere and we're constantly
59:41 discovering new species
59:43 uh has that created any type of panic or
59:45 discord no
59:46 of course not we're human beings we are
59:48 it is in our genetics to learn and to
59:50 evolve that is what we do as human
59:52 beings and so
59:53 if we realize that there are other
59:55 things on this planet
59:57 other than the things that we already
59:58 know well that's no real big surprise
60:01 because we're discovering new species
60:02 all the time
60:04 the real question is what happens when
60:07 we realize we are not at the top of the
60:08 food chain what happens when we realize
60:10 we are not the alpha
60:12 species on this planet now will that
60:15 have an impact on our psyche well
60:18 possibly yes it could um
60:21 you know but then again we're pretty
60:24 resilient and i think
60:25 most of us realize there's a long way
60:27 for mankind to go
60:30 if we were going to to being
60:33 some sort of cosmic or space faring
60:36 species
60:37 we have a lot of evolving to do we still
60:39 are very selfish
60:41 as a species we still do things uh
60:44 motivated by by you know
60:47 our human instinct which isn't always
60:49 good sometimes so
60:50 i think um you know that question you're
60:53 asking me is a question that really you
60:54 would
60:55 i would ask you to ask yourself because
60:57 i'm i can't answer for you i don't know
60:59 what it would mean for you i don't know
61:00 what it means for your neighbor or mom
61:02 or dad or your sisters or brothers or
61:04 the rest of germany or the rest of the
61:06 world
61:06 i'm not in a position to answer that i'm
61:08 only in a position to answer
61:10 from me and from my perspective for me
61:12 and
61:13 from my perspective i think it's
61:16 i think it would be a wonderful
61:17 opportunity for us
61:19 to uh potentially become less less
61:22 selfish and realize that
61:25 uh the universe is far more expansive
61:29 and more wonderful than we ever ever
61:31 thought possible
61:33 uh and there should be hope in that
61:36 scenario um
61:38 fear maybe to some degree because after
61:41 all we're humans we do fear the unknown
61:43 and that's probably healthy and that's
61:45 probably a wise choice to go in
61:46 a little bit cautious um but from my
61:49 perspective i think i think there's a
61:50 whole lot of hope i think
61:52 um it will help us really appreciate the
61:56 the enormity and beauty of of this thing
61:59 we call
62:00 we call the universe and what it means
62:02 to be human maybe we learn more about
62:03 ourselves
62:04 by learning more about something else um
62:08 and maybe frankly we're all part of in
62:10 this together maybe
62:12 if this is a species not from this
62:14 planet
62:15 maybe they're just as curious about us
62:17 as we are with about them
62:18 and maybe there's an opportunity to to
62:21 collaborate and cooperate
62:23 and and learn right wouldn't that be
62:25 wonderful yeah it would be so wonderful
62:29 thank you so much luis elizondo for this
62:31 interview
62:32 uh i wish you all the best of all the
62:34 projects that are coming up and a lot of
62:35 success with them
62:36 looking forward to the documentary
62:38 you're planning thank you robert
62:41 my privilege and thank you by the way
62:42 for everything you do and thank you for
62:44 what your audience does
62:45 because ultimately at the end of the day
62:47 if i may just take just a moment here
62:49 this conversation isn't really about me
62:51 and it's not about you
62:52 it's about everybody else out there it's
62:54 about everybody else who's ever looked
62:55 in the sky and looked at the stars and
62:57 wondered
62:59 what does it mean to be alive what does
63:01 it mean to be human
63:02 and do we have the courage to ask the
63:04 hard questions
63:05 not only to ourselves but to our leaders
63:08 uh
63:09 and those elected officials that are
63:11 that are there uh
63:12 to to represent us um
63:15 these are exciting times and i want to
63:18 thank you sincerely for
63:19 for taking this topic and having this
63:22 conversation in a serious way
63:24 um because that doesn't happen nearly
63:27 enough and and i'm
63:28 i'm hopeful that because of
63:31 conversations that you're having like
63:33 this
63:34 we'll be able to help
63:37 our collective efforts um better
63:39 understand
63:40 uh better understand one another and and
63:42 understand this topic
63:44 so thank you for what you're doing and
63:46 again thank you for your listeners uh
63:47 for hearing me
63:49 blab for the last uh last uh hour or so
63:53 but it has been my honor and privilege
63:54 thank you so much and it's been my honor
63:56 and privilege as well to talk to you and
63:58 i'd also like to thank you personally
64:00 for all the for the great job you're
64:01 doing and i guess without you stepping
64:03 out in the public the conversation would
64:05 still be
64:06 very different from what we're having
64:08 now so thank you very much
64:09 goodbye and good luck thanks take care

00:14 welcome to nfn the new frontier network
00:18 where we explore the new frontiers of
00:20 phenomenology
00:21 ufology and exopolitics
00:25 with me as always today he is victor
00:29 vigiani
00:30 yes this is victor vigiani here and that
00:32 that you're looking at right now
00:33 is chris iverson we'd like to welcome
00:36 you here
00:36 to our podcast and
00:40 our approach that we are going to be
00:42 taking as we
00:44 venture forth down this path of talking
00:48 to various people
00:49 in these fields of phenomenology ufology
00:52 and exopolitics
00:53 is we want to explore and push the
00:56 boundaries we want to push and explore
00:58 the new frontiers that exist out there
01:00 we are not so interested
01:02 although that's where we all come from
01:04 the lights in the skies
01:06 or the uh craft that have been talked
01:09 about from being under the seas
01:12 we are really more interested in
01:14 bringing forth a discussion here
01:16 that has to do with
01:19 the reactions the interactions
01:23 and the direction that we are being led
01:27 because make no mistake about it we are
01:29 being brought along a
01:30 particular path here and how we deal
01:34 with
01:34 what is going to happen we have
01:37 discussed in the past and we will be
01:39 discussing in
01:39 the future items such as disclosure and
01:42 what does disclosure mean to our guests
01:44 and to our panelists
01:46 these are all items that we want to
01:49 bring forth
01:50 we want to have a great discussion with
01:52 everybody on them we want to be sure
01:54 that
01:55 we are trying to uncover information
01:57 that is going to be new
01:58 and informative and exciting to our
02:01 audience out there
02:03 with that joining victor and i today is
02:06 our
02:07 very distinguished group of panelists

02:44 a very special guest with us today
02:47 victor why don't you tell us a little
02:48 bit about who we have
02:55 and you are muted you're muted
03:00 let me get that one right
03:03 yes uh yes i'll just uh introduce lou in
03:06 a moment i just want to
03:07 take off on a few of the things you said
03:08 um chris about you know where we're
03:10 headed with all of this
03:12 uh we've gotten so much information over
03:15 the last
03:15 uh three years beginning back in
03:17 december
03:18 uh of 2017 when thing with a damn kind
03:21 of broke open and after that
03:23 the floodgates are just sort of waggling
03:25 away with all this water pouring over
03:26 the dam
03:27 and i think we've got a pivotal pivotal
03:30 situation here with lou elizondo to
03:33 to shed some light on what has happened
03:35 what is going on right now and where
03:37 we're going with this so
03:38 i just want to tell um everyone how
03:40 pleased we are to have lou with us
03:42 just a bit of information about lou um
03:45 he's a career
03:46 intelligence officer with he was a
03:47 career intelligence officer with the us
03:49 army the department of defense
03:51 and the national counterintelligence
03:53 executive and the office of
03:55 director of national intelligence
03:57 there's a there's one feather in his cap
03:59 he's conducted and supervised highly
04:01 sensitive espionage and terrorism
04:03 investigations around the world ran
04:06 clandestine
04:07 sources source operations throughout
04:09 latin america
04:10 and the middle east he's a program
04:13 element manager for the pen he was a
04:15 program element manager for the
04:16 pentagon's
04:17 advanced aerospace threat identification
04:19 program
04:20 uh with multiple award patents career
04:23 intelligence officer with us
04:25 army and just i think i've just sort of
04:28 you know touched a bit of the whole
04:30 iceberg with lou so lou
04:31 welcome to the new frontier network we
04:33 are so proud and pleased to have you
04:35 with us today
04:37 well thank you first of all uh i want to
04:39 thank all of you for having me on is is
04:41 truly my sincere honor and pleasure to
04:42 be here with with you today
04:44 uh i apologize we couldn't do this in
04:46 person um but obviously
04:48 because of the the limitations of being
04:50 geographically separated and of course
04:52 the the current ongoing covet pandemic
04:55 but please allow me to extend
04:56 an apology for not being able to be with
04:59 you personally um
05:01 second of all i i certainly appreciate
05:03 the introduction
05:04 truth be told a lot of those
05:06 accomplishments uh
05:07 were achieved based upon people that i
05:09 was working with
05:11 you know a lot of times when you read
05:12 somebody's resume it looks really
05:14 impressive and
05:15 really the truth truth of the matter is
05:17 that a lot of those achievements were
05:19 were based upon my work with other
05:22 people and so
05:23 those successes were were mutual
05:26 successes
05:26 um you know we i think i think all good
05:30 high performing teams
05:31 operate just like that as a team right
05:33 just like your show you have right now
05:35 your podcast you've got
05:36 several high caliber people uh on with
05:38 you right to
05:39 to make this show just that much more
05:42 comprehensive that much
05:43 better and insightful well same thing
05:45 with me so again thank you for the
05:47 introduction but
05:48 uh if anybody out there is listening
05:50 who's ever worked with me you know i do
05:51 have to share a lot of those
05:52 those accomplishments uh with with other
05:55 people
05:56 well that's a breath of fresh air uh
05:58 with respect to the whole ufological
06:00 community
06:01 the research community throughout the
06:03 globe and that's one of the
06:05 the kind of pushbacks that i always
06:07 express myself to is that
06:09 uh there are too many lone wolves in
06:10 this in this uh i guess
06:12 realm of of research and i think the
06:15 only way that we're going to reach some
06:16 sort of consensus
06:18 about what's going on and reach a common
06:20 ground as to where we're going which is
06:22 the important thing
06:23 is the only way we're going to do that
06:24 is by working together and this kind of
06:26 effort that we've brought you know with
06:28 all the correspondence from across the
06:29 globe here
06:30 is sort of a reflection of how serious
06:32 we think this
06:33 is and also too to reinforce exactly
06:36 what you
06:36 would use it is a team effort so
06:39 everyone's perspective is important it
06:40 always sheds
06:41 light on things from a different angle
06:43 and i think that's the really strong
06:44 point of where we're going with that
06:46 today
06:47 with that i'm going to throw things to
06:48 giorgio georgio i know you've got
06:50 lots of questions uh do you want to
06:52 start us off with lou and
06:53 and maybe begin the discussion and let's
06:55 just go with wherever it goes from there
06:59 thank you victor yes um it was an honor
07:02 to meet
07:02 lou in peru and uh from our
07:06 time together there working uh for the
07:08 history channel and the air force i mean
07:10 on a on a non-paid at least i was doing
07:13 it voluntarily
07:15 um i could assess really that he's a
07:18 trustworthy person
07:20 he's an honorable person and a person
07:23 with a very good heart
07:25 and i thank him very much for the
07:28 healthy effort he is conducting for in
07:30 favor of this closure
07:33 so um one of the things that we we were
07:37 talking about was about uh promoting a
07:40 productive
07:41 social conversation worldwide
07:46 regarding the issue of ufos uaps
07:49 and what they may mean
07:53 this is a very important issue
07:56 for many years all of this uh theme has
07:59 been
08:00 surrounded by uh mystery and even
08:03 cynicism in the ufo community
08:06 but um what i would like to know is
08:10 ask lou um if he
08:13 agrees that the projects that mr mellon
08:17 mr mellon um christopher mallon did not
08:21 have
08:21 access to uh
08:24 should be supervised by the regular
08:28 uh i don't know how to call it um
08:30 information
08:31 ecology within the government
08:36 um because if we were actually talking
08:38 about
08:39 recovered alien bodies
08:43 mylabs perhaps military abductions
08:46 covertly conducted on some citizens and
08:50 successful retro engineering and this
08:52 kind of advanced aspects of these issues
08:56 do you think that uh do you think lou
09:00 that um the civic the civilian community
09:04 and the regular government
09:06 uh officials will would be able to
09:08 handle
09:10 such an information
09:13 well giorgio first of all thank you very
09:15 much uh for the kind introduction as
09:17 well i also want to say thank you
09:18 uh for your tremendous support for those
09:21 who don't know my friend giorgio here
09:23 was absolutely instrumental
09:25 in allowing us and facilitating our
09:27 ability to talk to very senior ranking
09:28 people
09:29 in latin america when we were down there
09:31 for history channels inside america's
09:33 ufo investigation so giorgio i want to i
09:35 want to begin by saying thank you very
09:37 much
09:38 you did a tremendous job we would not
09:40 have had any degree of success had it
09:42 not been for you
09:43 and i will tell you each and every time
09:45 i go back down to see my friends in
09:47 in south america you're going to be the
09:50 first person i call so
09:51 so thank you very much it was tremendous
09:54 uh
09:54 effort by you and your friends and your
09:56 colleagues and it was just frankly an
09:58 honor and a privilege to work with you
09:59 so thank you very much
10:01 secondly let me go ahead and address uh
10:03 your question um
10:04 as you re refer to mr mellon mr mellon
10:07 at the time with the assistant secretary
10:09 of defense um that's one of the
10:12 positions that are under
10:13 directly under the secretary within the
10:15 department of defense
10:16 yes to put this simply oversight is
10:19 always important in any type of free
10:21 society
10:22 when you have elected officials and you
10:25 have
10:25 entrusted individuals you appoint
10:28 individuals that you would trust
10:30 to manage and oversee and supervise
10:32 certain activities
10:33 in this particular case intelligence
10:35 activities it is
10:37 absolutely paramount in fact it is
10:39 illegal
10:40 if you do not give those individuals
10:43 oversight of the programs that they are
10:44 charged to oversee
10:46 and so i think it's a i think for
10:49 anybody let's take
10:50 mr mellon out of the equation entirely
10:52 and just say
10:53 anybody let's say you giorgio you get
10:55 appointed to be an assistant secretary
10:57 of defense
10:58 it is incumbent upon me if i work for
11:01 you
11:02 to provide you that information so you
11:04 can make the decisions you need to make
11:06 as a leader
11:06 period full stop and also be able to
11:09 inform the chain of command now we're
11:10 talking about a military organization
11:13 but it's really not a whole lot
11:14 different than any other type of
11:15 governmental organization
11:17 oversight is key otherwise without
11:19 oversight we have seen throughout the
11:20 world
11:21 when when when government programs
11:25 run amok when they go unsupervised there
11:27 is no checks and balance right
11:29 and a lot of times we see an abuse of
11:31 power when that occurs
11:33 um sometimes it's deliberate sometimes
11:35 it is not
11:36 but either way if you don't have that
11:39 proper oversight you set yourself up
11:41 for for not only mistakes but
11:43 potentially at some point abuses
11:45 and so to i know it kind of answered
11:48 your question a little bit obliquely but
11:49 i think it's important
11:51 uh for me to emphasize just how
11:53 important that oversight is actually one
11:54 of the fundamental reasons why i left
11:56 in 2017 the department of defense to
11:58 begin with my
11:59 my boss's boss's boss general mattis
12:02 then now
12:03 second then the secretary of defense is
12:05 somebody i served in combat with
12:07 so i i had a great sense of loyalty
12:09 loyalty and duty to this individual
12:12 and the system did not allow
12:15 information to get to where it needed to
12:17 go um
12:19 so so yeah i do think it's very
12:21 important
12:23 i don't that answers your question but
12:26 yes
12:26 uh well sure now i understand uh clearly
12:29 uh where you're coming from
12:31 uh the um the thing is uh whether
12:34 civilians are capable we don't know
12:37 if uh society in general is capable of
12:39 dealing with the most profound issues
12:41 regarding this
12:42 uap situation and if
12:46 there are successful let's say retro
12:48 engineering programs
12:51 can that be handled well let me
12:55 let me put it this way uh georgio we are
12:57 in the midst of a global pandemic right
12:59 now we call coven
13:01 we trust the american people to know
13:03 that there is a
13:04 virus out there that is highly
13:05 contagious for which there is no cure
13:07 for
13:08 until recently uh we trust the american
13:10 people with knowledge that there are
13:12 foreign adversaries that have
13:13 nuclear capable weapons that can
13:16 obliterate every city off the face of
13:18 the map here in the united
13:20 states we trust the american people with
13:22 all sorts of information
13:24 that constantly challenge our current
13:26 paradigm
13:27 so can we trust the american people can
13:30 we trust
13:31 citizens of the world with knowledge
13:32 that we may not be alone well
13:34 we already kind of have haven't we let's
13:36 let's take for example seti
13:38 the the program here for what by its
13:41 name
13:41 search for extraterrestrial intelligence
13:43 for a while it was receiving government
13:45 funding
13:45 so we were spending american taxpayer
13:47 dollars to deliberately look for
13:50 potentially life outside of our our
13:53 solar system
13:55 then we have nasa that is spending
13:57 millions if not
13:58 billions of american taxpayer dollars
14:00 each year specifically for the purposes
14:03 of finding
14:04 life somewhere outside of our planet
14:06 whether it be mars or
14:08 the moons of some of our uh exoplanets
14:12 i think i think it's i think that is a
14:15 fundamental question that is
14:16 that that that makes us human are we
14:19 alone
14:20 and so whether or not we trust people
14:23 to ask these questions these questions
14:25 already being asked
14:26 so can we trust people with the
14:30 knowledge that
14:31 there may be something going on here
14:33 well
14:34 i i think it's too late to ask that
14:36 question um i
14:38 i think i don't think there's a choice
14:40 in the matter i think
14:41 i think we're here and i think we're
14:43 we're at this point now
14:44 so we are forced to ask the question
14:47 okay
14:47 what are these things and at the end of
14:49 the day you know if there is some sort
14:51 of
14:51 logical terrestrial explanation for
14:53 these things great
14:55 but it's been an enigma for over 70 14:56 years and arguably maybe thousands of
14:58 years so
14:59 so i'm okay with that i'm satisfied with
15:02 it with a very earthly terrestrial
15:03 explanation
15:05 but i think we are doing ourselves a
15:07 disservice if that is the only place
15:09 we're looking for answers because
15:11 we are seeing these things operate and
15:14 maneuver in
15:14 a way that is that is so fundamentally
15:18 unusual in anything that we we have to
15:21 compare and contrast it to
15:23 that we have to ask the question are are
15:26 these things
15:27 not from here now let's be careful when
15:29 i say not from here because a lot of
15:30 people automatically say
15:32 to themselves well if it's not from here
15:33 must be from out there well
15:35 not necessarily true we now realize in
15:38 the world of quantum physics so let me
15:40 backtrack a little bit here because i
15:42 want to answer this question thoroughly
15:45 you know we had we had this this this
15:47 old way of looking at the world until
15:48 the renaissance and all of a sudden sir
15:50 isaac newton comes around
15:51 and proposes this newtonian physics that
15:53 really explains
15:55 our observations at the macro level of
15:58 of the universe and it took a couple
16:00 hundred years before einstein comes in
16:02 and he totally upset everything and all
16:04 the models by injecting this theory of
16:06 relativity
16:08 which seemed to be completely opposite
16:10 to
16:11 the principles of newtonian physics and
16:13 yet here we are they're very real
16:15 they're actually part of our universe
16:16 just as much as they're just as
16:18 relative and um um
16:22 factual as the newtonian physics and now
16:26 all of a sudden here we are in in the
16:28 20th century and now comes the
16:29 introduction of the latter half of the
16:31 20th century
16:32 quantum mechanics yet a completely
16:35 different way of looking at the universe
16:37 in fact
16:37 so so odd and so bizarre that one
16:41 scientist once said
16:42 it's like having a box and a dog walks
16:45 in the box
16:46 and out walks two cats it doesn't make
16:49 sense and yet
16:50 it absolutely describes what we are
16:52 seeing
16:54 at the micro and nano level of our
16:56 universe right so so quantum physics is
16:58 real and it's something completely and
17:00 totally different so
17:01 i guess my point to this my long-winded
17:03 explanation and why i went behind this
17:05 and i went to this analogy was because
17:08 when you
17:08 have this this question of where
17:11 it's from people have this binary
17:14 solution it's either here or
17:16 from out there but but but the universe
17:18 is is
17:19 is far more complex than that the
17:22 universe rarely works in a binary type
17:24 type uh model in fact the universe likes
17:27 to take diagonals and work in fractals
17:29 and
17:29 and you know these wonderful beautiful
17:31 arcs that we call the fibonacci sequence
17:33 so
17:34 my point being is that there may be
17:35 other alternatives out there if it might
17:37 be
17:37 something from and again i'm not saying
17:39 this is the answer because i don't know
17:41 but what if these things are actually
17:44 right from here
17:45 and always have been from here but you
17:47 know it's uh
17:48 it's it's it's it's something that could
17:50 be uh you know
17:51 trans-dimensional and when i say
17:53 transactional i don't mean this in
17:55 some sort of airy fairy philosophical
17:57 sense there are other dimensions we know
17:59 that as a fact that
18:00 quantum physics has proven that you can
18:02 look at things like string theory and m
18:03 theory there
18:04 there's all sorts of these these
18:06 loopholes in our current
18:07 understanding of the construct of the
18:09 universe so
18:11 i think we need to be objective when we
18:14 ask ourselves where these things are
18:16 from
18:16 could they be from could they be ours
18:18 yes could they be
18:20 someone else's yes could they be
18:22 something
18:23 else yes could it be from somewhere else
18:26 yes could it be from right here yes
18:29 there's a whole litany of
18:31 options that i think we need to be
18:34 prepared to ask ourselves
18:35 and not pigeonhole ourselves necessarily
18:38 into
18:39 uh it's an either or solution because i
18:42 i'm not sure
18:43 we have enough data to even draw that
18:45 conclusion yet
18:47 it would seem to be that way i mean what
18:48 you're indicating here lou is that
18:51 we definitely have a case of a
18:54 we haven't questions in front of us and
18:57 there's something that everybody looks
18:59 at depending on your perspective
19:02 you might actually see something else in
19:04 fact you could be the person observing
19:06 the
19:06 two cats walk out of the box the dog
19:08 went into and you don't even see two
19:10 cats
19:11 you see the space between the cats that
19:13 didn't exist there previously as well
19:15 so it's a very complex question and with
19:18 precise complex
19:19 question you don't necessarily have one
19:21 answer
19:22 it's very much a d
19:25 all of the above these are not
19:28 necessarily uh mutually exclusive
19:31 answers
19:33 is there a multiverse there appears to
19:35 be
19:36 are there extra dimensions there
19:38 certainly appears to be
19:40 is there some warping of uh time
19:43 and time being non-linear
19:47 that certainly seems to be and well
19:49 actually
19:50 you're absolutely right we've already
19:51 proven that concept right i mean
19:53 there there's we know two fundamental
19:55 ways to warp space time that's with a
19:56 lot of mass
19:57 or a lot of energy and when i when i say
19:59 that a lot of mass this is not
20:00 theoretical we
20:01 you can have uh for example gps a lot of
20:03 people don't know this but we spend a
20:05 lot of money
20:06 each month recalibrating the clocks on
20:09 our gps satellites that are orbiting
20:10 around earth now why is that well
20:12 the way gps works is you it's it's a
20:14 timing issue it's what it's like a
20:16 stopwatch
20:17 and what you do is you set up all these
20:19 these little satellites around the
20:20 planet
20:21 and depending how long it takes the
20:22 signal from the surface of the planet to
20:24 get to these satellites
20:25 etc and vice versa you can triangulate
20:27 where you are on the planet and why is
20:29 that important because
20:30 what most people don't know is that the
20:31 atomic cesium clock that is on board
20:34 a gps satellite is the exact same atomic
20:38 cesium clock that is at the ground
20:39 station
20:40 here on earth and so these clocks are
20:42 calibrated to run
20:43 precisely at the exact same time always
20:46 super super super accurate
20:48 and yet the moment we started launching
20:50 these these things up in space we
20:52 started realizing you had this weird
20:53 atomic clock drift
20:55 and the question is why are these all
20:56 these these clocks these atomic clocks
20:59 up on these satellites
21:00 why is there time so different than here
21:02 on earth it doesn't make sense and we
21:03 find out that oh
21:04 this planet itself the mass of this
21:06 planet the very planet we stand upon
21:09 is warping space-time sufficiently
21:11 enough where
21:12 the clock that is here at the ground
21:14 station begins to run at a different
21:16 pace than the clocks that are
21:18 that are orbiting our own planet so
21:20 these are not
21:21 theoretical concepts this is theoretical
21:23 fact this is the universe we actually
21:25 live in
21:26 where time is fundamentally it is it is
21:29 flexible
21:30 it is stretchable and i know that's hard
21:31 for people to understand because we look
21:33 in terms of
21:34 time as being linear but we realize now
21:36 that
21:37 time is like a rubber band it's it's
21:39 actually quite flexible
21:41 and it's not just time it's space as
21:42 well because space and time are
21:44 intertwined
21:46 um so yeah you're absolutely right
21:50 and then this is you know we have with
21:53 us today francisco who just happens to
21:55 be a university level professor and uh
21:58 this is a discussion that
21:59 we want to perhaps uh
22:03 you know further expand upon that when
22:05 you look at all of this information
22:08 and you look at where it's coming from
22:10 and the number of people and you touched
22:12 upon this a little bit
22:13 and uh your your first answer to giorgio
22:16 regarding
22:17 the number of programs that must exist
22:19 out there
22:20 uh francisco it's something that he's
22:23 been aware of and has studied in his
22:25 research and is looked at
22:28 and wonder if you had some questions for
22:31 lou here regarding the the programs and
22:34 the
22:34 varied approach that has been taken over
22:38 the years going all the way back to
22:39 project blue book and where we are today
22:42 and that we must have different
22:46 departments different organizations
22:49 different branches of the government
22:50 that are
22:51 all dealing with this and looking at
22:52 this in many different ways
22:55 exactly well thank you for for your time
22:58 for thank you for
22:59 for being here and to allow us the
23:01 opportunity to to talk to you
23:04 um so my my question is
23:07 regarding a blue book because when it
23:10 ended in in 69 23:12 general bolander uh said well there's
23:15 nothing more just
23:16 to to to to spend money on on studying
23:20 ufos everything
23:22 is explained but um each
23:25 every fighting that that had
23:27 implications to national security is not
23:30 part of blue book
23:32 so indirectly he was acknowledging that
23:34 maybe
23:35 there was another covert program
23:38 studying ufos
23:40 um when you joined
23:44 atip were you aware of past
23:47 programs and uh
23:50 eventually um and also
23:53 um why why the um
23:58 the show-off of 2017 24:02 i mean it's almost like uh
24:05 passing a rubber over over
24:08 the the past 70 years because the
24:11 the sightings uh the the the expression
24:15 from the pilots back in the 40s and the
24:17 50s
24:19 how they were amazed by the the um
24:23 the uh the the maneuvers from from
24:26 from those objects were so incredible
24:29 they are more or less the same
24:30 that we see with the nimitz case etc and
24:33 so
24:34 there were 70 years of studying probably
24:37 so why repeating um
24:41 in 2017 something that was
24:44 probably uh seen back in the 40s 70s
24:50 sure very very fair question so let me
24:51 see if i can recapture your question so
24:53 you want to know why during my time in a
24:55 tip a did we look at historical records
24:57 and information
24:58 to help make us make better informed
25:00 assessments and two
25:02 um if not why why didn't we look at
25:04 these these past experiences
25:06 70 years worth of observations to help
25:09 us
25:11 make a more informed um analysis if you
25:14 will detailed analysis of of of the data
25:17 is that is that correct is that what
25:18 you're asking me
25:20 exactly okay so very fair question so
25:24 first of all in order to answer that
25:25 question i think it's important to
25:26 understand a little bit about me and
25:27 luis elizondo and who i am so my
25:29 background has always been as a
25:31 as a special agent and investigator is
25:34 just the facts ma'am kind of guy um no
25:37 nonsense i spent my entire life
25:39 chasing bad guys terrorists and spies
25:41 that's that's my job
25:42 um i think it's critically important
25:46 when as an investigator okay if you are
25:48 let's look at this as a from a court of
25:50 law perspective
25:51 to preserve evidence you have to make
25:54 sure
25:55 you you handle evidence very carefully
25:58 so for me
26:00 my job has always been as an
26:02 investigator is to present the facts to
26:05 the jury in this case you are the jury
26:08 when i was in atip
26:09 it was my leadership that was the jury
26:11 it was very important that i never
26:13 cross-pollinated
26:14 information that i could not
26:16 substantiate as being valid
26:18 into that calculus because even though
26:20 it may be a hundred percent correct
26:22 because i personally my team could
26:24 not validate that information and it was
26:26 historical
26:27 it could not be it could not be put into
26:30 the equation of the calculus we were
26:31 dealing with because
26:33 we could not substantiate there was no
26:35 way for us to say yes i
26:37 we personally wrote this this report uh
26:39 we have the evidence we have the
26:41 photographs we have the videos so it's
26:43 like when you are going to a jury
26:46 you sequester yourself from any
26:48 information that is not
26:50 fundamentally related to the task at
26:52 hand my job in the department of defense
26:54 was national security
26:55 it wasn't humanitarian assistance it
26:57 wasn't uh
26:59 physics and and you know the scientific
27:02 community
27:03 it was intelligence and threats that
27:05 that's that wasn't my call that's
27:07 that is the job of the department of
27:09 defense so
27:10 because of that the greater umbrella is
27:12 always under a threat
27:14 if you will picture is something a
27:16 threat and and if you don't know then
27:17 you have to presume it can be until you
27:19 prove it's not
27:20 so when we were collecting our
27:21 information we were very focused on the
27:23 military sources the military
27:26 the technology that we could leverage
27:29 to help us understand what it is the
27:32 technology we're dealing with what are
27:34 these things that are flying around our
27:35 our nuclear strike group carrier groups
27:37 and what are these things that are
27:38 flying around our aircraft and our
27:39 nuclear facilities
27:41 are is the old information interesting
27:43 yes but sadly it's anecdotal
27:46 because it's all data right it's just
27:48 like an old cold case the older a case
27:50 gets
27:51 the less and less reliable that
27:54 information becomes
27:55 so we made a deliberate decision not to
27:58 muddy the waters and go to my
28:00 my for example you know the under
28:01 secretary and say hey boss
28:03 uh we got two things flying in the sky i
28:05 want you to read these reports from
28:06 1942.
28:07 that that's that's not helpful what i
28:09 need to say is hey boss
28:10 we got these things flying around our
28:11 sky and by the way here's a video taken
28:13 last week
28:14 from the cockpit of an a18 super hornet
28:16 you know doing maneuvers over
28:18 you know aor x y or z that's much more
28:21 compelling than a bunch of anecdotal
28:23 information
28:24 that quite frankly in some cases 70 28:27 years old now do i think it's not
28:29 relevant no i didn't say that
28:30 it is absolutely relevant to this
28:32 discussion because now i'm a civilian
28:35 and i i'm not i'm not under the same
28:38 yoke if you will rules that i was when i
28:41 was in the department of defense
28:42 so now we can open up the aperture if
28:45 you will
28:46 of what we're doing and include a lot
28:48 more information
28:49 i can also talk to a lot more people i
28:51 can talk to foreign nationals i can talk
28:52 to civilians i can talk to
28:54 civilian pilots when i was an aids if we
28:55 couldn't it was strictly
28:57 dod and intelligence only so uh
29:00 it's not that we we didn't want to
29:02 necessarily we didn't find it
29:03 interesting the historical information
29:06 but we didn't have the fidelity of data
29:08 that we do now we have
29:09 multiple sensors you know a single
29:11 aircraft flying
29:12 most people don't know is an
29:13 intelligence data collection platform
29:15 first and foremost yes it's a weapon
29:17 platform but it's also collecting
29:19 intelligence and data
29:20 and it's got many many many sensors an
29:22 entire suite of sensors
29:24 from anything from radar hyperspectral
29:26 technology and
29:28 infrared to help us better discern what
29:30 we're looking at so
29:32 reading a report from a pilot that's
29:33 describing a foo fighter incident in
29:35 1943 although interesting
29:37 i'm not sure is as helpful as you know
29:40 providing
29:40 a 17-page report on an incident that
29:43 occurred
29:44 let's say you know last year uh
29:47 with with color photographs and radar
29:49 data and video
29:50 and telemetry and all those other things
29:52 so um again i know i
29:54 i i'm probably kind of going into a
29:56 long-winded explanation
29:58 into this but i think it's important
30:00 because a lot of people ask me well why
30:01 don't you look at this data it's been
30:02 here for years well
30:04 we know it's been there for years but
30:05 it's not overly helpful in the job that
30:07 i was in
30:08 because i could not tell the boss face
30:10 to face yes i have validated and
30:12 verified this information myself
30:14 there's no way to do that so that's
30:17 unfortunately the reason why we we
30:19 really didn't you didn't see a lot more
30:20 of that historical information
30:22 being injected into into our efforts
30:26 uh during atip i think i think it's
30:28 important to recognize what you're
30:29 saying lou because
30:30 that information as it came down the
30:32 pipe back uh
30:34 when francesco was alluding to it that
30:36 information
30:37 had a gradual change on everybody who
30:39 digested that information
30:41 it it changed how we looked at the
30:43 phenomenon it changed
30:44 uh the phenomenon itself it changed the
30:46 facts they evolved
30:48 but it also changed us as a species
30:51 and i know chrissy you've got some
30:53 questions about how this kind of
30:54 information has changed us or changed
30:57 individuals
30:58 with respect to how it unfolds and comes
31:00 down to pipe over the years
31:02 yeah i glue in my in my day job outside
31:05 of looking into
31:06 biology and hanging out with great
31:08 people like this
31:09 i work at public relations so i'm
31:12 curious
31:13 you know throughout a tip throughout
31:17 any time working with the us government
31:18 yourself or just knowledge of
31:21 we hear a lot about people working
31:23 within the cia
31:25 tampering with media working in media
31:28 jobs in higher positions
31:30 and then tampering with what comes out
31:34 my question really is do you know of
31:36 anybody or yourself
31:37 that when you were disseminating
31:38 information during that time if you
31:40 decided to mislead the media
31:42 to make them think something else and if
31:44 it wasn't you has there been
31:46 anyone that you've ever worked with in
31:48 the us government that's decided to do
31:49 that
31:50 and if so why what was the main purpose
31:53 of it
31:55 oh so that's a great question um let me
31:58 first by
31:59 answer this question succinctly bottom
32:00 line is yes i am absolutely aware of
32:03 times where
32:04 u.s government spokespeople have
32:05 deliberately misled
32:07 the the the media and ultimately the
32:10 people the united states let's look at
32:11 mogadishu for example in somalia when
32:13 the united states was planning
32:15 the the the beach landing um during
32:18 somalia during the early days
32:20 uh information was leaked to cnn and
32:22 several other major media outlets saying
32:24 we're gonna come and we're gonna attack
32:26 on this beachhead right
32:27 so they brought up a bunch of cameras
32:28 and we sent a couple hovercrafts trying
32:30 to make it look like we're going to
32:31 invade
32:31 but that was actually a deception
32:33 operation we actually invaded
32:35 several miles away knowing that the
32:38 enemy was watching the tv
32:40 knowing that the enemy was watching cnn
32:42 and was anticipating
32:43 uh our landing to be in a different
32:45 location and so so
32:47 yes these incidents occur all the time
32:49 one could even uh you know i i don't
32:51 want to get too political here but even
32:52 the invasion of iraq you know predicated
32:54 on
32:54 on weapons of mass destruction that
32:56 turned out to be oh yeah not so right um
32:59 single source reporting you are in the
33:01 world of public
33:02 affairs and public relations you know
33:05 that sometimes data when it comes in has
33:07 to go through a certain filter
33:09 before it is disseminated and consumed
33:11 by by by
33:12 by the masses and why is that well
33:15 because it's
33:16 in some cases it's damage control and
33:17 other way in other ways
33:19 it's it's uh um fine-tuning a narrative
33:23 right and trying to avoid potential trip
33:25 wires and pitfalls
33:27 um now am i aware of us doing this
33:30 internally
33:31 in the united states the intelligence
33:32 community my organization
33:35 never did that because for us we were
33:37 under very strict rules and something
33:38 called intelligence oversight
33:40 and there's something called a procedure
33:42 15 violation
33:43 in the army and also in the greater
33:45 department of defense there are rules
33:47 and regulations because in the past
33:48 the department of defense and the
33:50 services haven't
33:52 always played well with others there's
33:55 been times during the 60s where we were
33:57 using
33:58 american soldier spies to go and collect
34:01 information on student groups right
34:03 which now would be atrocious you know
34:05 you could never infiltrate it you can't
34:06 do that
34:07 but back then you know some of these
34:10 assets were misused so
34:11 so congress put several laws into place
34:14 that
34:15 that really um
34:18 prohibit that to a large degree um
34:22 and usually when somebody is found out
34:24 to be doing that
34:25 it doesn't last very long um you know
34:27 from my perspective
34:28 i took an oath long ago to defend this
34:30 country from all enemies foreign and
34:32 domestic
34:34 and those enemies if they lie within the
34:36 construct of the u.s
34:39 governmental architecture well that
34:40 that's included anybody who's
34:42 deliberately trying to mislead the
34:43 american people on this topic
34:46 while i was in the program i i didn't
34:49 see it i will tell you the moment i
34:50 left till even today there is some
34:54 some there are some things occurring
34:57 right now that that disappoint me
34:59 for example you have this flip-flopping
35:02 of
35:03 uh public affairs first of all saying
35:05 that
35:06 a-tip was real and lou was part of it
35:08 then they said well a-tip was never
35:09 about ufos and of course the evidence
35:11 comes out oh it was about ufos well
35:13 blue never had anything to do with it
35:14 and of course senator reid has to come
35:16 out and say well actually he does
35:17 because he worked for me
35:18 you know and and you have this this
35:21 i i don't want to say it's
35:22 misinformation because it might not be
35:24 it may just be
35:25 frankly uh dysfunction and i don't want
35:28 to confuse the two and
35:29 i i hope well you know what that's a
35:32 great question i don't know if i'd
35:33 rather it be dysfunction or
35:35 disinformation because it's on one hand
35:37 if it's dysfunction then we've got
35:38 bigger problems on our hands
35:40 uh but if it's disinformation well we've
35:42 got a whole nother set of
35:43 problems on our hands so um you know i i
35:47 that's a great question and i don't want
35:48 to i don't want to hypothesize too much
35:51 on
35:52 intent because i think intent is very
35:55 important
35:56 and i don't know what their intent is
35:58 the only thing i can think of is
36:00 is that they want more breathing space
36:02 to try to figure this out so they have
36:03 answers because there's a lot of
36:04 pressure by the american people
36:06 on the american government to say what
36:08 is this right you have this
36:09 multi-billion dollar apparatus where its
36:11 whole job is to
36:13 identify and assess an enemy and yet
36:15 here's the thing in our sky we only just
36:17 now got the department of defense to
36:19 admit yes the videos are real and yes
36:20 they're real ufos
36:22 i mean it it took three years but hey
36:24 it's a start uh
36:25 and i think as more information i think
36:28 as more information comes to light
36:29 chrissy you're going to to see hopefully
36:32 more willingness more openness by the
36:34 american government
36:35 to have a conversation you just had the
36:38 nation of japan
36:39 openly uh discuss entering into an
36:42 agreement a bilateral agreement with the
36:44 united states government
36:46 for the sole purpose to discuss ufos and
36:48 uaps
36:49 that is historic don't make no mistake
36:51 the conversation is now evolving from a
36:54 from a u.s conversation to truly an
36:56 international one
36:57 now i know some people are going to say
36:58 well it's always been an international
37:00 conversation yeah true
37:01 but not acknowledged by the u.s
37:03 government that's different
37:05 it is now and you have the government
37:07 u.s government actively now engaging
37:09 other foreign countries on this topic so
37:12 you know as an intelligence officer i'm
37:14 trained to look at indicators
37:15 and that is a definite indicator that is
37:18 a huge
37:18 big red if you will flare in the sky
37:22 saying hey you know we are we are making
37:25 a signal here that we're willing to take
37:26 this topic seriously
37:27 you have the creation and the
37:28 establishment of a uap task force
37:31 which is really just an 8 tip 2.0 but
37:33 that's fine i mean it's
37:34 i think it's great and individuals that
37:36 are part of that organization
37:37 i i personally know and i respect and
37:39 have been part of the aitsu program
37:41 previously so
37:42 so i think i think we're we're
37:43 definitely in good hands i think we're
37:45 um
37:46 we're on a tremendous start and if i
37:48 have if the price of that disclosure
37:51 is people trying to snipe at me once in
37:54 a while or try to discredit me
37:56 you know what i'm fine with it i'm okay
37:58 with it because at the end of the day
37:59 look how far we've come
38:00 and we've done that collectively by the
38:02 way it's not i can't i can't take credit
38:04 for that because
38:05 really the credit goes to folks like you
38:07 that are willing to have a conversation
38:08 people in the media right people
38:10 people now saying hey this is important
38:12 we need to talk about i'm willing to put
38:13 my credibility on the line
38:15 uh and i'm willing to risk the raised
38:18 eyebrows and the sneers and the jeers
38:20 to have this conversation and it's
38:22 working you now have congress being
38:24 briefed on it you have presidents being
38:25 breathed on it this is
38:27 this is tremendous this is a this is i
38:28 hate to say you know in the terms what
38:30 we talked about with newton but i
38:32 believe this may be
38:33 may just be a new renaissance for this
38:35 topic at least i hope so
38:37 i hope so too it would it would be great
38:40 if it is i think one of the things that
38:41 could potentially be here that we're
38:43 talking about
38:44 and why there might be a way to uh or
38:48 they've utilized the if you want to call
38:50 it disinformation
38:51 or uh a little bit of wizard of oz the
38:54 man behind the curtain
38:55 is actually going on pay no attention to
38:58 that man but look over here
39:00 is something to do with might be the
39:02 threat assessment
39:04 and as you said we really didn't know
39:06 still really don't know
39:07 i'm sure there's much more known than
39:09 has been released of course
39:11 what it is that's flying above and below
39:13 us and has been interacting with us
39:15 um as far as a threat assessment goes
39:18 that's something with our panelists
39:20 manuel that we've been talking about
39:22 in depth regarding the threat assessment
39:24 and whether or not it really is a threat
39:26 and i know manuel you had some comments
39:28 and questions for lou in that regard
39:31 yeah i'd like to hear that because you
39:32 know you know i think it's important
39:34 from a from a intellectual perspective
39:37 to recognize
39:38 a threat assessment in government terms
39:40 really boils down to two things and
39:42 that's
39:43 capabilities versus intent that's it and
39:45 we've seen some of the capabilities but
39:47 we still have no idea the intent
39:49 so therefore we have no way to truly
39:51 assess the level of threat that this
39:53 this thing imposes uh on upon us if at
39:56 all it may very well be that it's not
39:57 but again
39:58 let's not forget that this was
39:59 department of defense right it's in this
40:01 term defense
40:03 national security issue that is the job
40:05 of
40:06 that department and so what anything
40:08 under the lens of dod
40:10 is always clearly going to be looked at
40:11 initially under the under the
40:14 lens of a potential threat
40:18 thank you chris thank you lou i also
40:20 want to thank you for your
40:22 dedication to educating the people about
40:25 this topic
40:26 and it's important that the
40:31 narrative that we craft is as accurate
40:34 as possible
40:35 so i perfectly understand you come from
40:37 a background where your job was to
40:39 assess threats and threat potentials and
40:42 when it comes to that i
40:44 also perfectly agreed looking at it
40:47 objectively there is a potential
40:48 of a threat you mentioned intent and
40:51 capability
40:52 uh typically all the people i
40:55 spoke with and nowadays they
40:59 also take context into consideration
41:03 which as the
41:06 word suggests puts things in a different
41:08 context sometimes if you look at a lot
41:11 of the actions
41:14 they may not really be hostile
41:17 but okay uh
41:20 even if you don't just focus on that if
41:22 you look at
41:23 the bigger picture of the contact
41:25 phenomenon
41:26 if you look at all the experiences that
41:30 people have had both with abductions or
41:33 with positive
41:34 contacts then what we see is that there
41:37 are
41:38 different groups present with different
41:41 agendas
41:42 and the majority of them
41:46 seem to be benevolent so i think it's
41:50 important when we craft the narrative to
41:52 not just focus on the threat it's a part
41:55 of it but it
41:56 from my experience is a
42:00 minor part of it that it's still
42:03 important
42:03 but it doesn't paint the whole picture
42:05 what are your thoughts on this
42:07 well i i think first of all you could be
42:09 right i think it's a 50 50. but i
42:11 if if and and i i hate to go down the
42:14 path of experiences but since you
42:15 brought up let's go ahead and do this
42:16 for a second
42:17 so for those who are familiar with the
42:19 term experiencers these are individuals
42:20 who claim to have some sort of
42:21 interaction with
42:22 uh a or a uap and potentially
42:26 it's occupants of their occupants i look
42:29 at this in very realistic terms
42:31 um if you were to go and take an uber
42:34 from your house right now to the
42:35 supermarket
42:36 and for some reason the uber driver
42:39 decides to go to his house first while
42:41 you're in the car and then maybe do some
42:43 shopping at the mall and then finally
42:44 take you to the store even though you
42:46 haven't been harmed
42:47 technically that's called kidnapping you
42:49 are being put somewhere moving somewhere
42:52 against your own free will period so if
42:54 for example my daughters were
42:56 taken somewhere and even if they weren't
42:58 hurt but they were taken somewhere that
42:59 they did not want to go
43:00 against their will i think that's that's
43:02 a problem i think that's a real issue
43:04 furthermore
43:04 if some of what these people are
43:06 reporting have actual
43:08 things devices their bodies are being
43:10 touched you know for
43:12 from my perspective again coming as an
43:13 agent former agent
43:15 that's assault you know possibly much
43:17 worse so
43:18 if someone does anything to you against
43:22 your own free will
43:23 to me that is a threat regardless what
43:26 the end result is
43:28 or if somebody for example if you have
43:30 somebody who's put secretly a camera in
43:32 your room
43:33 and can watch you anytime you they want
43:35 whether you're on dressing or eating
43:36 dinner or anything else
43:38 even though it's not a physical threat
43:40 it's a threat to your privacy it's a
43:41 problem
43:42 so so if something has the ability to
43:45 take you
43:45 against your own free will at any time
43:48 and at its own discretion without your
43:52 approval explicit approval then
43:55 i don't think that's benevolent i i i i
43:58 would challenge you in that
44:00 you know that that's that that could be
44:01 a very serious
44:03 issue and what if they decide
44:06 if it's if there is a day rather than
44:09 just
44:10 you know take you aboard somewhere and
44:12 put you back where you are maybe they
44:13 don't
44:14 maybe you're just gone forever i mean
44:16 these are some of the things that
44:17 you know i i look at through through my
44:20 lens
44:21 and again i don't have empirical
44:23 evidence for either side so
44:25 whether they are a threat or not i don't
44:27 know i'll give you a quick analogy
44:28 because you mentioned threat and i've
44:30 used this analogy before
44:32 but i really really mean it so if i may
44:34 ask you manuel
44:35 where do you live right now at this
44:38 moment i live in south africa but i'm
44:39 originally from belgium
44:41 okay so you live in south africa and at
44:43 night in south africa
44:44 beautiful country do you lock your front
44:46 door at night before you go to bed
44:49 to be safe
44:53 i do but i leave my gate open anybody
44:56 can come on to the property
44:58 okay but you you lock your front door
44:59 right and i suspect like most people do
45:02 you might even check your windows once
45:03 in a while
45:04 lock the windows and and if you live in
45:06 a big city you might even turn on the
45:07 alarm system just to be extra safe not
45:09 that you expect anything bad to happen
45:10 but
45:11 just out of out of out of precaution
45:13 well let's say
45:14 one night um after locking everything up
45:17 you go to bed and you wake up in the
45:18 morning
45:19 you come downstairs and have a hot cup
45:20 of coffee or tea and all of a sudden you
45:22 notice
45:23 muddy boot prints in your living room on
45:25 the carpet now
45:28 your doors are locked the windows are
45:30 locked and the alarm system's on
45:33 and yet in the morning you have muddy
45:34 boot prints in your living room that
45:36 weren't there before now
45:38 no one's been hurt nothing's out of
45:39 place nothing's been taken
45:41 but again you have muddy blueprints now
45:44 in your living room that weren't there
45:46 the night before is that a threat and my
45:49 my response to that is well it could be
45:52 if it wanted to be
45:53 so we don't know yet we don't have
45:55 enough data
45:56 to arbitrarily say yes or no
46:00 and so that would be my my personal
46:03 response to that question
46:05 i i perfectly agree with everything you
46:07 said
46:09 the thing is that if you look at the
46:11 contact phenomenon there's a whole other
46:13 side to it too
46:15 i don't know how familiar you are with
46:16 georgio's research for instance
46:18 or with the work of paola harris if you
46:21 look at contact experiences
46:23 in latin america the uh
46:26 so i'm not talking about abductions
46:29 experiences
46:30 that people experience as benevolent for
46:33 some reason
46:34 i'm talking about voluntary
46:38 being invited open contact experiences
46:40 as there have been
46:43 that is an important part of the whole
46:44 equation too
46:46 and it's often missing
46:49 in the narrative
46:53 that's what i was pointing at yes
46:55 certainly i think you know
46:58 emissary and and you know we all have
47:00 ambassadors right
47:01 countries and and that's the job of the
47:03 ambassador is to represent
47:04 the the will and the intent of the
47:06 people that they represent
47:08 so you know if there is an effort and an
47:11 outward effort to engage
47:13 if there is some other species that is
47:15 outwardly trying to engage
47:17 our species uh through these
47:19 quasi-diplomatic efforts then that's
47:21 something i would totally support
47:22 because ultimately
47:24 it it helps us gain our understanding of
47:26 what we're dealing with and and maybe
47:27 vice versa right
47:29 so i i you know we we have
47:32 as nations we have interests and we have
47:34 representatives
47:36 and ambassadors to some very unlikely
47:39 organizations and and and countries even
47:42 countries that are adversarial we have
47:44 representatives
47:45 there to facilitate uh cooperation and
47:49 communication so
47:50 i i would totally support something like
47:52 that if there is an
47:54 outward effort to to engage mankind
47:58 uh i think that's fantastic but i don't
48:02 think we should necessarily say well
48:04 because they're doing that if they're
48:06 doing that that there's no threat
48:07 because we have other countries that
48:09 that we have ambassadors with and good
48:10 relationships with but they still have
48:12 nuclear weapons
48:13 so you know there's there's that
48:15 capability that's still there the intent
48:17 might not be there
48:18 but the capability sure is and as we've
48:19 seen through history
48:21 intent can change on a dime there's
48:22 country that we have been friends with
48:24 and enemies with and
48:25 friends with so you know i i hate to put
48:27 all my eggs in one basket and simply say
48:29 you know hey let's all sing kumbaya i i
48:31 tend to be a little bit
48:32 just a little bit more cautious from
48:34 from that point while we're on the topic
48:36 of
48:37 contact uh i don't i think we should not
48:39 move away from that
48:40 uh chrissy you have a question regarding
48:42 that then after uh lou responds to your
48:44 question we're gonna throw it to giorgio
48:45 for another question so go ahead chrissy
48:47 yeah for sure lou so when we look at
48:50 things like
48:50 area school the aerial school incident
48:52 that happened in
48:54 from betty and barney there's so many
48:56 abduction cases that are connected to
48:58 uaps
49:01 will the government even remotely
49:04 acknowledge that or talk about it
49:06 because in one day that conversation
49:08 needs to be had
49:10 it's having within our community but it
49:12 needs to be talked about in a larger
49:14 scale
49:14 especially now when we have all these
49:16 things unfolding
49:18 you know month after month after month
49:20 that conversation
49:21 has to be had and what do you think it's
49:23 what do you think they're going to say
49:25 so i i first let me let me if i can
49:28 go back a little bit you you've said
49:30 something very interesting abduction
49:32 cases
49:33 now from a legal perspective and yes
49:35 that's kind of where i come from
49:36 abduction is something very specific
49:38 right if someone truly being first of
49:40 all we have to find out is someone
49:41 really being abducted
49:42 abduction is a it's a crime you're
49:45 taking someone against their own free
49:46 will
49:47 somewhere that they they haven't agreed
49:49 to go to okay so that's abduction and
49:50 then keeping them there for a while
49:52 the question is is an abduction actually
49:55 occurring
49:56 and then two if if if
49:59 there is some sort of interaction is
50:02 this
50:02 a physical abduction
50:06 or is there some sort of other
50:08 psychological
50:09 event occurring that gives the
50:11 impression to one that they are truly
50:12 being abducted
50:14 now i i know it sounds crazy but we have
50:17 weapons right now and psychological
50:18 operations and whatnot we even have
50:20 these experiments going on we call it
50:21 the god helmet
50:22 using certain frequencies of
50:24 electromagnetic radiation we can
50:26 induce certain emotional feelings and
50:29 even hallucinations in the human being
50:31 we've done it we're doing it now and a
50:33 lot of universities
50:35 are looking at these experiments because
50:36 at the end of the day the human brain is
50:37 nothing but
50:38 a bunch of electro electric connections
50:40 that's all it is it's neurons electrical
50:42 connections
50:43 so just like any other electrical system
50:45 you can short it out you can do all
50:46 sorts of strange things with it so the
50:47 question is
50:48 are is the phenomena of abduction
50:52 actually occurring and and i'm not going
50:54 to go either way on that but what i can
50:55 say is
50:57 if it is really occurring then it is
51:00 something that we need to talk about but
51:02 we need substantial evidence and proof
51:03 and it gets
51:04 it has to be more than just uh somebody
51:07 in the backyard with no eyewitnesses it
51:09 has to be a a
51:13 and i don't want to say a credible
51:14 individual because people if they're
51:15 going to say well i'm credible i
51:16 understand that when i say a credible
51:18 uh event i mean you have to have lots of
51:21 witnesses look
51:22 you and i can watch a car crash you can
51:24 be on one side of the street i can be on
51:25 the other side of the street and we will
51:27 describe the same exact event completely
51:28 differently
51:29 and we will see things differently so so
51:31 it's really important the more
51:33 witnesses you have what witnessing an
51:35 event the more credible it becomes
51:37 because you have
51:38 people looking at the same event at the
51:41 same time
51:41 at the same place under the same
51:43 circumstances so
51:45 it's it's important a a single report of
51:48 somebody how many people report all the
51:49 time hey
51:50 you know my my girlfriend or my
51:51 boyfriend i think just got kidnapped
51:52 well there's a reason why we give a
51:54 24-hour grace period
51:56 before we file a missing person because
51:59 good chances that they really weren't
52:01 they probably just went and and
52:03 went to the neighbor's house and and
52:04 fell asleep or maybe had one too many
52:06 beers so
52:07 it's important that when we're dealing
52:09 with this particular topic that we only
52:11 look at
52:12 from a governmental perspective you want
52:13 us to look at the at the empirical data
52:16 you don't want us getting to anything
52:17 that's subjective that's why in a court
52:19 of law
52:20 you say oh well that's hearsay well
52:21 that's that's someone else's observation
52:23 that's really not so relevant
52:25 unless you had directly eyes down on an
52:27 event now do i think it's worth having
52:29 the conversation
52:30 absolutely do i think that if there is
52:31 empirical data substantiating that the
52:33 government needs to get involved you're
52:35 damn right it does
52:36 um the problem is that data hasn't been
52:39 quantified and qualified
52:41 yet in a way that paints a compelling
52:44 picture that that's going on at least
52:45 from my experience with the data that i
52:47 had
52:47 access to we're not there yet and we
52:50 want to be very careful prejudicing the
52:52 jury saying
52:53 that you know in all these abduction
52:55 cases well okay first of all what does
52:57 abduction mean
52:58 let's be specific and then two you know
53:01 because everybody will describe there's
53:02 a lot of commonalities and then there's
53:04 a lot
53:05 of differences between each and every
53:07 one of these cases
53:08 and it could just be our frankly our
53:10 human um
53:12 if you will our our human analytic
53:14 overlay of what we're experiencing
53:16 you know again we can we can look at the
53:19 exact same thing
53:20 and you and i describe it completely
53:22 different i'll give you another example
53:23 i'm colorblind
53:24 and so when you say oh look at that
53:26 beautiful sunset isn't that gorgeous
53:27 that beautiful red well
53:29 i may describe it as a beautiful red
53:31 sunset but i don't see it that way
53:33 i see it something different in which
53:34 the question is which is the truth well
53:36 they're both true
53:38 and i think we have to be be cautious
53:40 when we go down that avenue
53:42 i i've always kept my opinions to myself
53:44 regarding abductions
53:46 um only because i don't have enough data
53:48 to to speak
53:49 from an authoritative perspective people
53:50 say well there's countless amount of
53:52 evidence out there an issue could they
53:54 bring it forward
53:55 and it can't just be what he said she
53:57 said you know
53:58 by the way i don't disagree with you
53:59 yeah why what would the government do
54:01 about that then like how would they
54:02 disseminate that information because
54:04 obviously you would scare so many people
54:08 if well even wondering one abduction
54:12 you're right and we have to take baby
54:13 steps to to to address this you're
54:15 absolutely right
54:16 what would the government do i don't
54:18 know that's a great question i think the
54:20 way i think we need to ask the
54:21 government government that question
54:22 without saying hey these people are
54:24 being abducted what are you going to do
54:25 about it i would say hey
54:26 if it turns out that there are
54:28 individuals that are
54:30 are being taken you know whether
54:32 willingly or unwillingly
54:34 what is the role of our government to to
54:36 either stop it or
54:37 understand it right i think i think it's
54:39 a super fair question
54:41 i i don't think there's anything wrong
54:43 with asking that question
54:44 i think how you ask it's important
54:46 because what happens the moment you go
54:48 to
54:48 like the leader and say i want to know
54:49 why so many people are being kidnapped
54:51 you know and taken aboard the mothership
54:53 i don't think you're going to get very
54:54 far you know i i really don't
54:57 because of the the 70 years plus of
54:59 stigma and elvis on the mothership and
55:01 tin foil hats
55:02 that is not helpful to the conversation
55:04 and anybody who comes forward says well
55:06 i know what's going on you're exactly
55:07 the reason why we haven't had this
55:09 conversation yet
55:10 because we don't know what's going on
55:12 yet and we no one is truly an expert
55:15 this is my whole issue with the term
55:16 ufology and ufologists
55:18 and no disrespect to anybody who
55:20 considers himself that but you know you
55:22 go to a university an academic
55:23 institution
55:24 and you get a degree in geology you're a
55:27 geologist or
55:28 a degree in immunology you're an
55:29 immunologist or a degree in psychology
55:31 you're a psychologist
55:33 and yet no one goes to school to be a
55:36 ufologist there is no expert everybody
55:38 claims to be an expert and there's this
55:40 this
55:40 landscape is so riddled with hucksters
55:42 and fraudsters
55:43 uh and people making cottage industries
55:45 for themselves that you really don't
55:47 know who to believe
55:49 and um it makes it really difficult to
55:52 have a conversation with an elected
55:53 official especially a senator or a
55:54 congressperson or a president
55:56 about this topic because you know it is
55:59 charged with a lot of stigma and
56:00 people are so emotional about it there's
56:03 a lot of people
56:04 who are absolutely certain they have the
56:06 answer but i will tell you the one
56:07 lesson i learned in intelligence
56:09 you can be absolutely sure of something
56:11 and still be absolutely wrong
56:18 you know the more you know the more you
56:19 find out
56:21 the more you realize that there is a
56:24 broader world out there and that you
56:26 know
56:26 less than you even ever thought
56:35 am i in the room no in fact in terms of
56:37 even with abductions for instance
56:39 as you're talking about them there have
56:42 been studies done very
56:43 very good scientific studies have been
56:45 done regarding people who have reported
56:47 their experience
56:48 with this phenomenology and
56:50 approximately 75 percent of them have
56:53 indicated that they would like those
56:55 experiences to continue
56:57 so then you look at it in terms of well
57:00 do we have a little bit of stockholm
57:01 syndrome going on here where
57:03 you're identifying with the people who
57:05 are taking you and are your captors
57:07 or is it indeed a very
57:10 pleasant experience and know they're not
57:12 coming in and asking permission and
57:14 filing
57:15 triplicate form with the mayor of your
57:17 town to say can we take this individual
57:19 and talk to them for a couple of hours
57:21 they are coming in and taking you
57:24 ostensibly against your will
57:26 but if you wish to go back again then is
57:28 really what happened
57:29 in abduction that occurred or is it more
57:32 of we didn't exactly ask your permission
57:34 first but we brought you on board
57:36 and we're examining you and taking you
57:38 through it
57:40 um even though there are people that
57:42 have indicated and as
57:43 you said you know your brain is we are
57:46 electric beings
57:47 our our body is controlled by
57:49 electricity the neurons
57:51 and perhaps it's a case of those people
57:53 coming in and they're brainwashed
57:55 and they're told hey you enjoyed the
57:58 experience it was good for you come on
58:01 back
58:02 is it that we don't know but all of
58:04 these are questions that we still
58:05 really don't know and it does call for
58:08 more studies to be done
58:10 i know georgio there's one of the things
58:12 that you had
58:13 we had been talking about is secrecy and
58:15 the role of secrecy
58:17 regarding this information and who has
58:20 what information and what is going on um
58:23 i know you had some comments and or
58:25 questions for lou in that regard
58:29 yes i have been following also the
58:32 alleged contact experiences since 1975 58:37 after a personal family connection with
58:41 those events in peru
58:44 i would like to suggest that the
58:46 situation is much more complex
58:48 and nuanced than abductions
58:51 as we normally understand it
58:54 a person like kathleen martin i would
58:58 highly recommend kathleen martin
59:02 regarding her abduction research what
59:05 happened
59:06 when when uh they did this research they
59:10 found that most people didn't
59:11 consider their experiences abductions
59:15 but abductions get most of the attention
59:18 the classical abduction scenario gets
59:20 most of the social
59:21 cultural tension but that's not what is
59:23 happening
59:24 also in um let's say the free research
59:28 the foundation for uh experiencers
59:32 uh research founded by edgar mitchell
59:34 the astronaut
59:37 we came up with a survey for three
59:40 or four thousand people from 105 59:42 countries
59:44 responded an anonymous survey
59:48 which gives more credence to the wide
59:50 variety first
59:52 of experiences first that it is real it
59:54 is
59:55 real really happening with a lot of
59:57 people at least they
59:59 you cannot say that they're all lying or
60:01 that they're hallucinating
60:04 but um and that's something has to be
60:06 looked at
60:07 uh also manuela miroi has a wonderful
60:10 research
60:11 regard for many decades regarding
60:13 experiences of
60:14 of of many many many people
60:18 around the world uh if we are truly
60:21 going to assess
60:23 assess uh beyond the patterns that were
60:27 used in the pentagon
60:29 in your work with atib if we're going to
60:32 truly assess what's what may be going on
60:36 we need to try to listen to the
60:38 experiencers
60:40 and i can tell you it's a very complex
60:43 issue
60:44 most of the experiences do not seem to
60:46 be
60:47 abusive in uh in our human understanding
60:50 of that term
60:52 um but i would like to ask you something
60:54 more specifically
60:58 would ttsa be interested in
61:01 significantly
61:02 scientific and scientifically recording
61:05 and interactive
61:07 sighting in the us or perhaps latin
61:10 america or europe
61:12 uh if the opportunity arose by means of
61:16 credible
61:17 contactees so that you could
61:22 record an objectively in an in an
61:25 objective way an interaction
61:28 that doesn't have to become an abduction
61:32 you know what i mean if we are truly
61:34 going to assess if this is an actual
61:36 threat or not
61:37 or at least most of it an actual threat
61:40 or not we need to start
61:41 to listening to listen to the
61:43 experiencers the
61:45 the genuine experiencers and also
61:49 to try to interact with the phenomenon
61:51 uh objectively
61:53 would teach you to be willing to do this
61:57 so georgia wonderful question i can't
61:59 speak on behalf of ttsa but i can tell
62:01 you personally absolutely
62:03 one of the things that it you know we
62:04 could certainly look at going down the
62:06 road here is having a
62:07 scientific uh with with with
62:11 with proper cameras and everything else
62:13 uh an attempt to
62:15 to interact with things i think that's
62:16 the holy grail of all this right if we
62:18 have an ability to
62:19 to to communicate truly communicate in a
62:22 way and that communication doesn't have
62:23 to be even a conversation right there's
62:25 all sorts of ways to communicate i can
62:26 go like this and people know what that
62:28 means
62:29 um you know any any any basic form of
62:32 communication
62:33 i think would be incredibly helpful
62:36 to this cause but i don't think it's
62:38 going to be necessarily the dod the
62:40 department of defense or frankly
62:42 ttsa that will lead that that charge
62:45 you know i think i think um a fair
62:48 objective scientific academic approach
62:51 to this
62:52 would be more than welcome i don't think
62:54 you're going to get any pushback
62:56 it's something that certainly you know i
62:57 think as a
62:59 coming from my background scientific
63:01 background is cool and whatnot
63:02 you know i i welcome the scientific
63:04 method and i think that would be out
63:06 that's something i would be absolutely
63:07 part of in fact there's a
63:08 an effort i'm i'm doing right now um
63:11 very quietly working with some
63:13 individuals
63:14 that proposes to do something very
63:16 similar to that
63:18 see if we can quantify and qualify data
63:21 based upon some interesting experiences
63:24 that are occurring in a particular area
63:26 i think that that would be
63:28 fantastic absolutely open to it and i
63:32 the problem is is it's you know actually
63:34 doing it
63:37 i'd like to circle back for a second
63:39 lulu if we could
63:40 um with respect to you know where you're
63:43 going with your organization and what
63:44 you did
63:45 in atip and all of the the directions
63:47 that things were moving
63:48 uh let's just drop a scenario here for a
63:50 second regarding this thing called this
63:52 thing called disclosure
63:55 and and with the caveat that i really
63:56 don't know what that means okay
63:58 let's just pretend that disclosure is a
64:01 package
64:02 that sits on a desk of somebody or a
64:04 group people very very important saying
64:06 okay
64:06 what are we going to put in this package
64:09 if we wish to have a discussion or begin
64:13 a narrative with the general public
64:15 about this thing called the ufo et
64:17 question and whatever that is
64:19 what's going to go into that package
64:21 that you may be
64:22 familiar with and what might they keep
64:25 out of that package
64:27 okay so uh wow no one's ever asked me
64:30 that before
64:31 um so let me make sure i give you a i'm
64:34 gonna give you a world according to lou
64:35 answer and then i'm gonna give you a
64:37 a probably a little bit more uh um
64:41 formalized response as if i was a
64:42 government official
64:45 the lu the so the the
64:49 i'm going to do that in reverse actually
64:50 i'm going to give you the formal
64:51 response in that box that i'm going to
64:53 be giving to my senior leader is going
64:54 to be the who what when where how why
64:56 of things basically just the facts right
64:59 this is what it is this is how it works
65:00 this is where it's from this is who's
65:01 behind the wheel this is their intent
65:03 all the things you would need to make a
65:05 tactical and strategic decision
65:08 about this topic right you have to arm
65:10 so to speak
65:11 the leadership with the necessary
65:13 information to allow them to make
65:15 well-informed decisions so those are all
65:17 the interrogatives that we we think
65:18 about
65:19 and that you would expect from from an
65:21 organization organization like
65:23 department of defense
65:24 now let me give you the new answer to
65:27 that what does disclosure mean well
65:28 i can't that means talking to academics
65:31 and scientists and philosophers and
65:33 theologians
65:34 and everyday people and citizens because
65:36 this is a topic that involves every
65:37 single one of us no one has a monopoly
65:39 on this no one
65:40 no one owns this topic so therefore i
65:43 think it's going to be a
65:44 mutual conversation and we all come from
65:46 different backgrounds with different
65:48 philosophical leanings so this is a much
65:51 more comprehensive question what does
65:53 big disclosure capital d look like well
65:56 i don't know i'm not sure anybody does
65:58 you know uh what
65:59 because we're i think we're in the
66:01 middle of the pro i think once we get
66:02 there we'll realize we'll be able to
66:04 look back
66:05 hindsight being 20 20 will be able to
66:06 say ah these were the formative years
66:08 where disclosure was occurring
66:10 i think i think it's happening now i
66:11 think we're living through those days i
66:13 think we are absolutely
66:14 in the midst of disclosure but it is a
66:17 process it's not an event it's not a
66:18 aha see i told you so that's not the way
66:21 it works
66:22 it's a continuous learning process it's
66:25 a cycle
66:26 and the more data we get the more we
66:28 improve our own hypothesis and the
66:29 better that we can ascertain what's
66:31 what's really going on so um
66:34 you know that box that you put on
66:36 someone's desk so to speak
66:38 of what disclosure looks like
66:40 unfortunately is continuing to get
66:42 bigger and bigger
66:43 there's there's there is no i'm not sure
66:47 there is
66:47 a an end there because we're always this
66:50 is such
66:51 a tremendous enigma such a paradigm
66:53 change to our species we're finally
66:55 coming to realize that
66:56 oh my goodness this is real you know
66:59 this may take decades this may take
67:01 centuries this is not an instant
67:03 gratification this is not a
67:04 you know forgive me for saying this
67:06 burger king have it your way and have it
67:08 now
67:08 that's that's not the way real life
67:10 works real life takes a long time to
67:12 understand look how long it took us to
67:13 to prove that there was such thing
67:15 called a giant squid of the pacific
67:17 you know how long does it take for us to
67:19 understand mother nature
67:20 and yes all this universe is part of
67:22 mother nature well it takes a long time
67:25 and i i know people are hungry for
67:28 information and i know they
67:29 want you know the quick sound bites and
67:32 they want a a solution
67:34 but this may be one of the cases where
67:36 you're not going to get that
67:37 instant solution maybe your great
67:39 grandkids might
67:41 and i think as long as we prepare
67:42 ourselves for that and manage
67:44 expectations
67:45 we're probably all going to be a lot
67:46 better off i think we've come
67:47 tremendously far in the last three years
67:50 but if you were to ask me now oh lou is
67:52 this the the
67:54 the beginning of the end no i don't
67:56 think so well
67:57 is it the end of the beginning no i
67:59 don't think so i think we're at the
68:01 beginning of the beginning
68:02 now people are going to say well that's
68:03 awful that's sad that's terrible lou i
68:05 mean my gosh you know we want our
68:06 answers i said no
68:08 it's wonderful how many times in life do
68:10 you get an opportunity
68:11 to to begin to unwrap a christmas
68:14 package you know little by little this
68:16 is amazing these are exciting times
68:17 we've come so far in three years
68:19 and and we are living through these
68:21 times of being able to
68:23 really nod our head for the first time
68:25 from from our ancient greeks and
68:27 philosophers wondering are we alone in
68:29 the universe
68:30 and speculating that to native americans
68:32 and our indigenous people looking to the
68:34 skies and seeing things and writing
68:35 those things down on petroglyphs
68:37 we are here we're at the precipice we
68:39 are now as a society maybe even as a
68:41 world
68:42 finally having this conversation and
68:44 able to digest
68:46 what is really going on i think that's
68:48 incredible
68:49 and and if i die with only that
68:50 knowledge then i i
68:52 i die a a much wiser person
68:56 at least from my perspective yeah i
68:58 before i get to francesco i just want to
69:00 mention that at some point before we
69:01 finish off i'd like we'd like to get
69:03 your perspective on
69:04 what's happening in the in the u.s
69:05 senate right now as far as marco rubio
69:07 is concerned
69:08 but right now i'd like to throw it to
69:09 francesco francesco i know you've got
69:11 another angle to to approach with lou
69:18 yeah uh just just a quick question uh
69:21 and it's it could be placed in in the
69:24 beginning of
69:24 should have been placed in the beginning
69:26 of the conversation i think it was
69:28 you in one of your presentations uh
69:31 eventually in europe
69:32 italy um or in the u.s and
69:35 you used the acronym aav
69:38 advanced aerospace vehicle not a
69:41 phenomenon
69:42 but a vehicle um which means
69:46 someone is controlling it maybe not et
69:49 but someone is
69:51 um did you uh during atip
69:54 and had some sort of uh profile
69:58 of different objects with different
70:01 eventually different characteristics
70:03 different
70:04 dynamics etc um
70:07 that that's that's my question and
70:09 another follow-up which is
70:11 quite different um would ttsa
70:15 eventually think on having an
70:18 international approach
70:19 to the phenomena using
70:23 researchers from different countries for
70:25 example
70:27 so let me start with your first question
70:30 about are there commonalities and
70:32 characteristics do we find differences
70:34 in in characteristics of these vehicles
70:36 uh
70:37 that or if you want to calm you whatever
70:38 these these phenomena are aavs advanced
70:41 aerial vehicles
70:42 uh yes the bottom line is we came really
70:44 far in understanding there were some
70:45 interesting commonalities
70:47 whether we're talking about discs or
70:48 cigar shapes or triangle shapes
70:50 uh we had some scientists and
70:52 mathematicians looking at this
70:54 and i think we are a lot closer now to
70:57 understanding the
70:58 potential potential physics behind these
71:00 things than we ever have been before
71:02 i cannot go into detail of what that is
71:04 and what that looks like
71:06 but um i i think we are a lot closer to
71:09 that prize than most people think
71:12 it turns out that a lot of the
71:13 observations we've seen from
71:15 instantaneous acceleration hypersonic
71:16 velocities low observability transmedium
71:19 travel and of course a
71:20 positive lift or anti-gravity if you
71:23 will
71:24 for many years we looked at these we
71:26 tried to figure out each one of these
71:27 observations from
71:28 the perspective of some sort of exotic
71:30 technology and
71:32 one of the findings was from atip was
71:33 that it may very well be that
71:35 all of those observables are actually a
71:38 result
71:38 of a the manifestation of a single
71:40 technology and if you know how to do
71:42 x all these other things can now occur
71:45 and so
71:46 that was a that was a crossing of the
71:48 river moment for us
71:50 it was very exciting for us and it
71:51 turned out that the math worked
71:53 and same with some of the scientific
71:54 models so so that was tremendous for us
71:56 now
71:57 uh back to your second question about
71:59 ttsa having an international body again
72:01 i can't speak on behalf of ttsa
72:03 but we're already moving in that
72:04 direction chris mellon and myself
72:06 and and several others um you know ttsa
72:10 is fundamentally right now
72:11 a company uh that has several different
72:14 missions
72:15 chris mellon and myself have really one
72:18 single focus mission
72:19 and that is to to get this on the agenda
72:23 of anybody and everybody out there
72:25 uh especially their governments so we
72:27 can have have this conversation
72:29 and start sharing information like we
72:31 should have been doing for a long time
72:32 ago
72:33 as we should have a long time ago
72:34 between nations there's a reason why we
72:36 shouldn't
72:36 um so yes
72:40 i think when you look now at japan
72:42 coming out and
72:43 openly and willingly to have this
72:45 conversation we are beginning to realize
72:47 that
72:48 uh our our push on the international
72:50 side is working
72:51 uh talking to folks like giorgio who has
72:53 helped us very much in latin america
72:55 to get to the right people um the
72:58 conversation is occurring and it's
72:59 occurring
73:00 not because of of me and chris we are we
73:02 facilitate it but we're not
73:04 it's crying because you it's occurring
73:06 because of people like giorgio that are
73:07 that are willing to go out and and put
73:10 their reputation
73:11 on the line and have this this
73:12 conversation take place and
73:14 i think you're going to begin to see
73:16 without letting the cat out of the bag
73:17 in the next
73:18 year some very significant efforts
73:20 moving forward on an international side
73:22 now that the conversation has occurred
73:24 here in the united states and here
73:25 domestically i think it's only logical
73:28 that the next step is to take this
73:29 conversation internationally there's a
73:31 lot of things that are happening behind
73:32 the scenes
73:33 that most people aren't even aware of
73:34 but what happened with with japan
73:36 isn't a coincidence that's not just
73:38 japan when they wake up saying hey we
73:39 want to share
73:40 ufo information with the united states
73:41 there's a lot of work that's being done
73:43 behind the scenes to make this type of
73:45 things happen
73:46 and it's not with just and it's not only
73:47 in japan so um
73:49 you know i got to be careful what i say
73:50 because i'm no longer employed by
73:53 as a us government official in this
73:55 capacity so i have to be careful what i
73:56 say
73:57 can't speak on behalf of the united
73:58 states government but i think one can
73:59 only see
74:00 with for themselves look at the
74:01 indicators and make the conclusion that
74:04 there's something something happening
74:06 here that that has never happened before
74:09 that's that's great i think the
74:10 international movement's tremendous
74:12 let's move it back a bit again
74:14 to uh the question of mark um
74:18 ruby marco rubio with respect to the
74:20 intelligence authorization act
74:22 of 2021 and his efforts to insert this
74:26 really i just did a press release on
74:28 this last night
74:29 to insert this section on uh the
74:32 advanced threat
74:33 and first of all your opinion as to why
74:35 he inserted that
74:37 into a pretty mundane act that comes out
74:39 every single year
74:40 what was his agenda in putting that in
74:42 and where do you think this is going to
74:44 go
74:44 and what kind of conversation do you
74:46 think it'll open up in the in the future
74:48 if any so
74:51 i can't speak on behalf of marco rubio i
74:53 tell you i had the the privilege of
74:55 going to school with him back at the
74:56 university of miami many many years ago
74:58 when we were young
74:58 young guys uh and you know we we weren't
75:02 friends you know
75:02 i didn't even know each other who who
75:05 each other was probably
75:06 now that we know who each other is you
75:08 recognize oh yeah you're that guy on
75:09 campus and you're that other guy
75:11 uh but the bottom line is um i i can't
75:14 speak on behalf of marco rubio what his
75:16 intent was i can
75:16 but what i can say is i would suspect
75:18 that um
75:20 you know hint he was probably provided a
75:23 substantial briefing on this topic
75:25 and he's doing his patriotic duty he is
75:28 he is doing what he's supposed to do as
75:30 a senator and that is take a
75:31 an important topic and raise it so it
75:33 can be addressed
75:34 that's exactly what he should be doing
75:37 so i you know in response i tip my my
75:39 hat to him he's
75:40 he's extremely savvy he is he's
75:43 incredible
75:44 and he's a very very shrewd senator so
75:47 he
75:47 you know he's not a spring chicken he
75:49 knows what he's doing and he knows the
75:50 political landscape and he knows how to
75:52 get things done
75:53 and i think he's using those tools
75:56 the best way he can and and i got to
75:58 tell you apolitically speaking
75:59 i i applaud him tremendously for that
76:01 that took a tremendous amount of
76:03 husband if you will guts to do um you
76:06 know like senator reid
76:07 before him right these are opposite
76:10 sides of the political spectrum and yet
76:12 they're coming together on a common
76:14 cause that affects us all equally
76:16 and i think that's again that's more
76:18 cause to celebrate right i think a lot
76:19 of times we get lost in elections and it
76:21 becomes like a super bowl right my team
76:22 versus your team and
76:24 well no this is all our team it's all of
76:25 ours you know uh this we're all in this
76:27 together we're all stuck on this little
76:29 tiny rock hurdling through space through
76:31 an obscure part of the galaxy
76:32 you know around an average star um
76:36 there's only as i've told people before
76:38 there's only one rule to life and no one
76:39 gets out alive so
76:41 we should all we should we should all
76:43 work together on this topic especially
76:45 if it affects us all chris i'm going to
76:48 throw it to you it's
76:49 a great sure yeah it's a
76:52 a great point to bring up and
76:55 it does make me think about you know
76:58 some of the
76:58 statements that you have made previously
77:00 though in regard to both
77:02 atip and then onwards to the stars
77:06 regarding the
77:07 information uh that you have in the data
77:10 that we have
77:12 you know talking about the aav for
77:14 instance
77:15 uh sounds an awful lot like a tr3b
77:19 that has been talked about for quite
77:21 some time
77:22 is it something that we have and then is
77:24 up there and does
77:26 uh take advantage of and we'll just use
77:28 that term for now anti-gravity
77:31 but there's probably something that is a
77:33 phenomenon that
77:34 produces multiple results uh
77:38 that's just one statement but going back
77:40 to
77:41 at the very beginning of when the
77:44 release first came out through the new
77:45 york times and there was a video
77:47 released and then there was another
77:48 couple of videos released
77:50 there were statements made at the time
77:53 that there was a considerable amount of
77:55 evidence that was sitting there a
77:57 considerable amount of data and
77:58 information
77:59 that was going to be brought forth and
78:04 i now have calluses in my fingers from
78:06 drumming my fingers on the table waiting
78:09 for
78:09 the fourth fifth sixth seventh drops to
78:12 come on that
78:13 and i was wondering if you could fill us
78:15 in a little bit on
78:17 what the nature of that information and
78:19 data is that's sitting there in this
78:21 great big box and what the size of that
78:23 box is and what the contents of the box
78:25 are and when we might see the inside of
78:26 that box
78:29 sure uh put us succinctly you're already
78:31 seeing inside the box and don't even
78:32 realize it
78:33 um when more is to come i think it's
78:35 important to realize that
78:36 you know that my job at atip and my job
78:40 now
78:40 is not to satisfy the idle curiosity of
78:42 people i don't mean that with disrespect
78:44 please don't take it that way
78:45 it's just i know people they see a video
78:47 they see a picture they go aha there it
78:49 is yes there's a lot more videos and
78:50 pictures
78:51 but that's not up to me to release
78:52 that's going to be up to the u.s
78:53 government and they may never decide to
78:54 do it
78:55 when we see morris coming forward it is
78:58 what you are seeing with congress what
79:00 you are seeing
79:01 incrementally internationally what you
79:03 are seeing with the media
79:05 that's not by chance there is a
79:08 tremendous amount of effort being
79:10 happening behind the scenes for us to
79:12 take this conversation seriously and my
79:14 question to you is would you rather see
79:16 another video
79:17 and and be stuck on the google chat
79:19 rooms and and you know social media
79:21 talking about a video
79:22 or would you rather have your
79:23 congressman put in a bill language that
79:26 establishes a uap task force
79:28 a real program to do this that's
79:31 that's that's the prize not another
79:34 video or another picture are there other
79:35 videos yes there are are there other
79:37 pictures yes
79:38 and you know i i wouldn't be surprised
79:40 if some of that comes to light at some
79:41 point but that's
79:43 that's helpful at the micro level it
79:45 makes people feel
79:46 uh interesting right it's like a
79:48 fireworks show but that's not
79:50 that's not what is going to move this
79:53 effort forward
79:54 if there's a there's a
79:57 i believe we have to be very deliberate
80:01 how we have this conversation now i'm
80:03 gonna tell you
80:04 in in retrospect i know there's critics
80:06 out there that say well lou
80:08 you don't control the narrative you
80:09 shouldn't be controlling the narrative
80:10 how who are you to decide how we have
80:12 disclosure and that's a great question
80:13 because i'm not
80:14 i should not be the one to make that
80:15 determination and i don't make that
80:17 determination
80:18 but all i can do is use those tools that
80:21 i have in my tool bag
80:23 to accomplish the mission that i've been
80:25 given and
80:26 not everything is you don't fix
80:29 everything with a screwdriver just like
80:30 you don't fix everything with a hammer
80:32 you know there's a time to use those
80:34 tools there's a time for a video to come
80:36 out
80:36 and again i i kind of left some bread
80:38 crumbs if people know
80:40 how i work they'll realize every time i
80:41 have one of these conversations
80:43 i always leave breadcrumbs always and
80:46 if you look at at the beginning of this
80:48 conversation i said you know i think
80:49 more information is going to be
80:50 forthcoming
80:52 i i i'm not saying that frivolously
80:55 i'm telling you that from my
80:57 understanding there's going to be
80:59 more of this information coming out of
81:01 the box now i'm not telling you if it's
81:03 a video or a picture
81:04 or reporting or whatever yeah i'm not
81:07 going to go there
81:08 um but i i think
81:11 i think we are already unwrapping the
81:13 present i think that i think that we are
81:15 inside the box already
81:16 um i would wait for some of the fog to
81:19 clear and i'll bet probably some more
81:20 things will become a little bit more
81:22 clear for us to see
81:23 and you know maybe consume but these are
81:24 exciting times and we've got to get
81:26 people in the government who are now
81:27 charged with handling this topic
81:29 we've got to give them the latitude
81:30 we've got to give them
81:32 breath and death to maneuver and operate
81:35 this because this is the first time it's
81:37 ever been done and there's people who
81:38 still want to kill it
81:39 there's still people who don't want this
81:40 to occur so so
81:42 you know it's it's right now in in a
81:44 kind of a precarious delicate balance
81:46 you know you've got some people saying
81:48 full
81:48 boogie let's do this you got other
81:49 people saying uh-uh
81:51 we're not gonna do it we'll just wait
81:52 out this administration and wait for
81:54 another one or another one or another
81:55 one right
81:56 so you know it's uh it's it's still a
81:58 bit of a running gun battle
82:00 unfortunately i think that what you're
82:02 talking about the fog
82:03 clearing louis is a good analogy because
82:06 all this information has been coming out
82:08 first of all and
82:10 there's the other factor to this the
82:12 information that has come out
82:14 and the history that francesco talked
82:16 about
82:17 all of that information is weighing on
82:19 the shoulders of people like yourself
82:22 and i know um there's a certain level of
82:25 anxiety
82:25 frustration whatever you want to call it
82:27 and i'm going to throw it to chrissy to
82:30 to frame that question for you because i
82:31 think it's something that i saw in some
82:33 of the unidentified
82:35 programs that you've done so chrissy
82:37 i'll just throw that to you and
82:38 you frame the question because i know
82:39 you have a really good perspective on
82:41 that
82:43 well where are you folks so just so you
82:44 know i got about 10 minutes i'm sorry
82:46 and then i've
82:46 of course i can come back later on go
82:48 right ahead
82:49 yeah where i wanted to go with some of
82:51 them some of the questions too was
82:53 looking at working with you know tom
82:55 delong into the stars
82:57 why did you decide to go with that
83:00 community
83:01 rather than any other community that you
83:03 know talks about uaps
83:05 and then also i'm assuming you have a
83:06 strategy that's working with
83:08 major icons experts pop culture experts
83:12 that live like we say like billy ray
83:15 cyrus has come out recently and said
83:17 that he's seen ufos
83:18 we know that when you work with some
83:21 type of icons and experts that they will
83:23 help push
83:23 agenda have you guys planned can i ask
83:25 that have you planned into the stars
83:28 with tom delong to use that vehicle
83:30 and if so who are those people that are
83:33 you looking
83:34 to to work with alongside of that
83:36 strategy to disseminate your information
83:39 well i'll let tom answer the question as
83:42 it relates to people in hollywood i'm
83:44 not a hollywood guy i'm not an actor
83:46 i'm not a performer what with me what
83:47 you see is what you get um
83:49 that's why you know obviously when we're
83:51 doing unidentified they wouldn't even
83:52 put a makeup artist on me because
83:54 this is it it doesn't get any better no
83:57 hope for me um
83:58 but when it comes to the entertainment
83:59 side and engaging
84:01 people in hollywood that's really tom
84:03 forte not mine
84:04 that's a ttsa thing my that's not really
84:07 my focus or chris mellon
84:08 i want to answer your question
84:10 succinctly you asked me why what was my
84:12 deciding factor to jump on this
84:14 boat and it's really three people it's
84:16 it's
84:17 chris mellon hal pudov and steve justice
84:20 these individuals are people who i've
84:22 known uh if i didn't know them
84:24 personally i knew of them for a very
84:25 long time
84:27 they had incredible reputations and
84:29 these were very serious people who were
84:30 charged with defending america
84:32 and so i trust them with my life period
84:35 full stop and so
84:36 anytime someone pulls up on a boat and
84:39 says hey
84:40 jump on board we're going to go take the
84:42 beach head when you have
84:44 those three individuals to me that's
84:46 like the dream team
84:47 um you know these are are men that i
84:51 i i respect with with every
84:54 every every fiber of my existence
84:58 um so that's why i made that decision
85:01 now as far as engaging people in
85:03 hollywood
85:04 um again you'll have to forgive me i'm
85:06 not a hollywood guy i
85:08 i live in the middle of wyoming nowhere
85:09 wyoming because
85:11 i i don't fall into that crowd i'm not a
85:13 glitz and glam kind of guy i
85:15 i i build you know old jeeps and
85:18 motorcycles as a hobby that's that's me
85:23 so i think again not to be oblique but i
85:27 think i'll let tom probably
85:29 answer that question that's that's not
85:30 my forte my job is engaging government
85:33 people
85:33 my job is engaging military intelligence
85:36 people
85:36 uh people like you uh in in the media
85:39 that that
85:40 want to know um i can i can do that
85:42 because i'm used to communicating
85:44 complex information to senior dod
85:47 leadership and the intelligence
85:49 community in a consumable manner so that
85:51 that's where my guess my my skill set
85:54 comes into play
85:55 uh but um yeah i don't i don't really
85:58 engage hollywood
85:59 uh those folks actors and performers uh
86:02 i
86:03 i don't know what to say i i wouldn't
86:05 know even how to how to approach people
86:07 like that first of all i don't run into
86:08 the circles i'm not like i said i'm not
86:10 a hollywood guy people see oh you got
86:11 that guy on tv
86:14 but i'm not a tv guy i we chris melon
86:17 and i did that show
86:18 and we made the decision to do it it was
86:20 only a short-term project it was to get
86:22 the conversation going neither one of us
86:24 wanted to be on tv none of us liked
86:25 being on tv
86:26 but we knew that if we wanted to get the
86:27 conversation going we would have to do
86:30 this in a manner that everybody could
86:31 see the evidence for themselves
86:33 provided it was not at the classified
86:35 level so that's why
86:37 we decided to team up with history
86:38 channel because we wanted to
86:40 we wanted to present this information to
86:42 help the conversation
86:43 to begin but that was our intent
86:48 so again i don't think i really chrissy
86:50 answered your question very well but no
86:52 you did
86:53 that's okay that's okay yeah no uh lou
86:56 uh we've pretty much kind of
86:57 run the string out here when i put a
86:58 button on this uh i want to thank you so
87:01 much for your honesty for your
87:02 authenticity
87:04 and uh your deep emotional response to
87:07 this issue not just with respect to the
87:08 information but
87:10 we've seen the man very clearly right
87:11 now i'm hoping i'm hoping right now that
87:14 we
87:15 allow our viewers to see who you are and
87:17 what you represent
87:18 and how you're attempting to bring this
87:20 thing forward literally as you said with
87:22 every fiber of your body and we don't
87:24 get that kind of authenticity from
87:26 people very often with respect to this
87:28 issue so i want to thank the panel for
87:29 doing all of this
87:31 and being with us and lou just before we
87:32 leave uh before i throw it to chris
87:34 could you just outline force very
87:36 quickly where people might want to go or
87:38 or could go to find out more information
87:40 about what you do and what
87:42 the academy is all about or whatever
87:44 else you can provide for yeah so so
87:46 ttsa has it has its own website um you
87:49 just type it in google and jump on the
87:50 web page
87:51 um you know i'm probably going to be
87:53 potentially launching something here
87:55 soon that allows people to
87:58 to interact and engage maybe a little
88:00 bit more
88:01 specifically about the phenomena itself
88:04 um
88:05 unfortunately i don't i don't have
88:07 anywhere to direct your folks to right
88:09 now i do have a
88:10 a twitter page this is by the way a big
88:13 step for me because i'm not savvy with
88:14 social media
88:15 i'm kind of like a monkey at the
88:16 keyboard so uh i try my best
88:19 um but uh you know people are surprised
88:22 because i do engage people on that
88:23 platform people ask
88:25 questions say oh lulu will never respond
88:26 and yeah actually i do
88:28 you know i'm pretty pretty approachable
88:32 you know of course in other ways look if
88:34 people are really interested
88:35 they can contact you and if you see fit
88:38 you can you can have them contact me
88:40 i'm out here in wyoming if anybody ever

00:21 am blasting out of the mojave desert
00:24 like a scirocco
00:25 blazing across the land slamming into

00:30 nano particle of unobtainium greetings
00:32 from the boldest
00:34 bawdiest most outrageous city in the

00:38 fun sin sex and secrets my not so humble
00:42 hometown las vegas nevada
00:44 my name is george knapp your occasional
00:46 host designated driver of the airwaves
00:49 and moderator of tonight's upcoming
00:51 cacophonous cavalcade a conversation
00:54 tonight we stand on the edge of the
00:56 official beginning of winter a
00:57 cold and dark time but especially this
01:00 year so
01:00 if you're going to be huddled at home
01:02 doing your christmas shopping by
01:03 computer preparing for
01:05 somewhat muted holidays the least we can
01:07 do is give you something cool to listen
01:09 to and
01:10 tonight's program should meet and exceed
01:12 that standard
01:13 it's hard to go a day these days without
01:15 some kind of ufo-related news story
01:18 popping up
01:18 in media somewhere around the world a
01:20 classified photo snapped by a navy pilot
01:23 for example
01:24 controversial claims made by an israeli
01:26 space scientist
01:28 efforts to finally approve a budget for
01:30 the pentagon's uap
01:31 task force there's one common
01:34 denominator to all of these stories
01:36 and it's lou elizondo when he left his
01:38 job as a career
01:40 intelligence officer with the department
01:41 of defense back in 2017 01:44 and then two days later showed up on a
01:46 stage with rockstar tom delong
01:48 to announce the creation of to the stars
01:50 academy and then two months later helped
01:52 the new york times put together this
01:54 blockbuster front page story about a
01:56 secret pentagon ufo study
01:58 this subject was changed forever and
02:00 it's not going to be easy for anyone to
02:03 put the genie back into the bottle
02:05 now that the taboo has been kind of
02:06 smashed into pieces
02:08 other people are coming forward
02:10 investigations are underway
02:12 congress is asking questions media is
02:14 covering it and there is more news
02:16 on the horizon in just a few minutes lou
02:18 elizondo returns to talk to us about
02:21 current events what comes next the
02:23 search for evidence meta materials
02:26 the future of ttsa and a lot more can't
02:29 ask for a better guest at a better time
02:31 as i told lou about an hour ago let's
02:33 make some waves
02:35 in the second half tonight another of my
02:37 favorite guests an intrepid researcher
02:39 and writer who
02:40 truly owns the niche of investigating
02:42 ufos uaps weird phenomena
02:45 secret programs from behind what we used
02:47 to call the iron curtain
02:49 the former ussr eurasia the baltic
02:52 countries the far east
02:53 paul stonehill is a terrific storyteller
02:56 and investigator
02:57 he's co-authored a new book about usos
03:00 unidentified submerged objects aka
03:04 underwater ufos a topic made all the
03:07 more
03:07 interesting and relevant by revelations
03:10 made here in the u.s with help from lou
03:12 elizondo
03:12 unidentified objects detected underwater
03:15 in and around engaging with our naval
03:18 units and pilots
03:19 the same things have been happening for
03:21 a long time in russia and have been
03:23 investigated by their military and their
03:25 scientists although we don't get to hear
03:27 much of that well paul
03:28 has collected piles of information in
03:31 addition his youtube channel reports on
03:33 all sorts of other kinds of mysteries
03:34 the
03:35 outlaw past mystery those mysterious
03:37 deaths for instance
03:38 uh the ghost village of the urals where
03:40 the residents of an entire town
03:42 vanished the search for the enduring
03:45 mystery
03:46 mystical magical land of shambhala the
03:49 buddhists have long believed the
03:50 paradise of
03:51 peace and wisdom exist in tibet but
03:53 maybe there's another one in siberia
03:55 that story and a lot more coming up with
03:58 paul stonehill

05:04 radio because we're about ready to
05:06 rumble
05:06 in a moment lou elizondo i'm george
05:09 knapp and this is coast to coast am
05:12 welcome back lou elizondo is a career
05:14 intelligence officer whose experience
05:16 includes working for the u.s army the
05:18 department of defense the national
05:20 counterintelligence executive
05:21 the director of national intelligence he
05:23 was a special agent in charge of
05:25 and supervised highly sensitive
05:28 espionage and terrorism investigations
05:30 around the world
05:31 anti-cartel anti-terror anti-drug
05:34 i have seen a list of the things that he
05:37 oversaw that has not been made public
05:39 and could tell you he was directly
05:41 involved in overseeing highly sensitive
05:43 stuff including
05:44 something called atip now we had never
05:46 heard of that before
05:48 uh the new york times broke it open in
05:49 december of 2017 three years ago this
05:53 week
05:53 and when that news broke it changed
05:56 everything for the study of ufos that
05:58 that formerly
05:59 secret study known as atip uh was part
06:02 of uh something that started out called
06:04 ossap
06:05 lou elizondo left that position because
06:08 of frustrations
06:09 over how the subject was being handled
06:11 he didn't think it was being taken
06:12 seriously enough
06:14 and we've all got a chance to learn
06:15 about his career and
06:17 his efforts to investigate this very
06:19 strange topic
06:20 i can't thank you enough lou for coming
06:22 back to the program
06:25 well george as always thank you very
06:26 much for having me and also a very
06:28 special thanks to
06:29 to your listeners and the audience out
06:31 there who decided to
06:33 stay up extra late and and listen to
06:35 this conversation
06:37 thanks for having me i want to start
06:38 with something fun because
06:40 since you were here the last time you
06:42 made a fateful decision
06:44 to enter the strange world of social
06:47 media
06:48 when i saw that you had signed up for
06:50 twitter i thought uh he's
06:52 he's lost it he's um he's he's lost his
06:55 senses he's out of his mind
06:56 because i mean it is a a world fraught
06:59 with peril am i
07:00 am i wrong uh actually you and me both
07:05 um it was uh with great angst
07:08 i decided to have a social media account
07:11 um
07:12 as you know i i george i tend to be a
07:14 creature of the shadows
07:16 partly because of my my previous
07:18 profession and of course because of my
07:20 training
07:21 and um you know let's face it you know
07:23 when you put yourself
07:24 out in in a public forum like social
07:26 media
07:28 you really are opening yourself up uh
07:31 to to a whole lot of things and some of
07:33 it's positive and frankly some of it's
07:35 quite negative and there's a lot of
07:36 criticism out there
07:38 um and you know social media is one of
07:41 those things that
07:42 although kind of kind of new i guess to
07:44 to to folks like me
07:46 um i i do think it plays an important
07:49 role and i'll tell you
07:51 one of the most probably endearing um
07:54 aspects of social media has been this
07:56 this
07:56 incredible um outpouring of what we call
08:00 ufo twitter um you know this is
08:03 uh this is a a an enclave if you will
08:07 of individuals uh who are very
08:09 interested in the topic
08:10 and and frankly most take the topic very
08:13 very seriously have dedicated a lot of
08:15 their their personal in some cases
08:17 professional time
08:18 uh to the study of uaps so um
08:22 so yeah i mean it's a bit terrifying but
08:24 at the same time
08:25 satisfying so i guess uh maybe like a
08:28 first date if you will
08:29 i was imagining in my head the
08:32 conversation that you must have had with
08:33 your wife when you were telling her
08:35 you're going to do this
08:36 um i i can imagine the kind of feedback
08:38 you got
08:39 that conversation went over like a lead
08:40 balloon uh neither no one in my fan
08:43 family other than my two daughters i
08:46 really have social media i really had to
08:47 rely on my daughters
08:49 uh and still do actually for a lot of
08:52 their help
08:52 um you know social media has a lot of
08:54 different uh
08:56 buttons if you will and different things
08:58 that you can do on it
08:59 and you know i'm always just one i got
09:01 really first of all for the record i got
09:03 really fat fingers i got fingers like a
09:04 sausage you know
09:05 they're not very delicate uh and uh you
09:08 know
09:09 it's really easy to press the wrong
09:11 button you know so if you want to put
09:12 like a smiley face and all of a sudden i
09:14 press the wrong button and
09:15 next thing you know i'm transmitting out
09:18 to the world you know probably some sort
09:19 of obscenity so i
09:21 i have to be very careful and uh and i'm
09:24 constantly seeking guidance from from
09:26 people that are far more
09:27 far more savvy than i am in social media
09:30 so
09:30 on ufo twitter you're engaging with
09:33 people who before you were on that site
09:35 would
09:36 bash you pretty much hour by hour
09:39 every day and they would do it based on
09:43 snarky little things that would slip out
09:45 of your former employers at the pentagon
09:47 can you explain give us a general sense
09:49 of what your life is like now i mean it
09:51 was tumultuous when you came out and
09:53 surprised your employers
09:55 showing up on that stage with tom delong
09:57 and hal
09:58 and and chris a melon um they were
10:01 shocked
10:02 and there was a lot of pushback for you
10:04 there were repercussions for you that
10:06 you
10:06 didn't really describe in detail in
10:08 public but
10:09 had things settled down um you know they
10:12 the pentagon has put out a variety of
10:14 different stories about you what your
10:15 role was
10:16 a tip had nothing to do with ufos they
10:18 said lou elizondo didn't work for it
10:20 anyway
10:20 um has that all been straightened out
10:22 are you still catching flack
10:25 well i mean boy that let me let me
10:28 unpackage that a little bit
10:29 first of all you're right i i received a
10:32 tremendous amount of backlash from a lot
10:34 of people but not just from the pentagon
10:36 and people inside the pentagon but
10:38 but but people out of the general public
10:40 and you're right
10:41 social media has given me ability and
10:43 ability to engage those individuals i
10:46 i firmly believe the truth has nothing
10:48 to fear so
10:49 i think the best way to to handle
10:52 quote-unquote haters
10:55 is is to address their concerns i i why
10:58 not
10:58 i mean if they have genuine concerns and
11:00 genuine questions
11:02 then you know let's let's let's talk
11:03 about it let's see if we can address
11:05 some of those concerns or questions that
11:06 they may have
11:08 um because i think friends are certainly
11:10 uh better than al
11:11 i think friends are better than enemies
11:13 i think allies are better than uh
11:15 than having people out there that you
11:16 know um
11:18 frankly i think have probably honest uh
11:20 and good questions
11:22 but they don't have uh they don't have a
11:24 good answer and so
11:25 naturally when you have somebody that's
11:27 got these outlandish claims about
11:29 in this case ufos um you know as my
11:32 friend chris mellon says
11:33 you know extraordinary claims require
11:36 extraordinary evidence so let's let's
11:37 provide the evidence
11:38 now back to your second part of that as
11:41 far as the
11:42 the amount of opposition i was facing
11:44 within the pentagon and the u.s
11:46 government
11:47 there are still pockets that exist but i
11:49 will tell you it's
11:51 not near to the level as it was of just
11:53 two years ago
11:55 it's annoying because at this point i
11:58 think most people
11:58 recognize the truth and what my role is
12:02 that a tip you know was really a program
12:04 about ufos
12:05 you have statements for the record by by
12:07 senators in fact and and other senior
12:10 members of the us government who who
12:12 were there when i was giving these
12:13 briefings to senior dod personnel
12:16 so i i'm not sure that's really a
12:17 question anymore i think for me the most
12:19 disappointing part is that
12:21 those pockets of resistance inside the
12:23 pentagon that still
12:24 tried to hold on to the old old uh
12:27 narratives
12:28 about a tip not being about ufos etc
12:32 it's really for me disappointing because
12:34 it makes the pentagon look bad
12:36 and and the pentagon is it's not a bad
12:38 organization
12:39 um these are people that are patriotic
12:41 uh they're
12:42 experts in the in the work that they do
12:44 and and they do their work
12:46 selflessly day in and day out um
12:50 and so when you have some sort of
12:53 if you will disjointed communication
12:55 inside the pentagon
12:57 it's really a bad reflection on the
12:58 entire pentagon
13:00 and it's not really fair it's it's not
13:02 like there's this this
13:03 machine called the pentagon that's out
13:05 to get luella zondo and out to get harry
13:07 reid and
13:08 out to get the a-tip program um
13:11 it's it's just small pockets i think of
13:13 resistance
13:14 that we're seeing and unfortunately
13:16 those pockets you know can still
13:18 i hate to say gum up the works for the
13:20 for the rest of the machine but
13:22 you know you have a car in automobile
13:24 all it takes is a squeaky
13:25 squeaky belt and you know you've got
13:28 problems now you got to start
13:30 looking at what's making that belt that
13:31 belt squeak so
13:33 um it's not as bad as it was um
13:36 i still have to be very very cautious
13:38 because you know
13:39 again i keep saying to people i have a i
13:42 still maintain an active security
13:43 clearance
13:44 i know a lot of people think it's an
13:45 excuse a lot of people say oh well you
13:47 should you know
13:48 forget about your nba and your own oath
13:50 to the to the
13:51 to the government and you should just
13:53 tell us everything that you know yeah
13:54 and tell us from prison
13:56 from prison yeah right and really my
13:58 oath to the to the government is really
14:00 my oath to the american people
14:01 what people don't realize is that oath i
14:03 took and others like chris mellon
14:05 and hal it's not just an oath to this
14:08 you know
14:09 if you will this this
14:12 giant machine called the us government
14:14 it's really to the american peoples to
14:16 the taxpayers because at the end of the
14:18 day that's who our allegiance is
14:19 to and so we take that that earth very
14:22 very seriously
14:23 um so anyways there you have it george
14:26 uh
14:27 bottom line it's gotten a little bit
14:29 better uh it's it's not fixed by any
14:31 stretch but we've come a long way in
14:32 three years
14:33 let's jump into some current events a
14:35 story comes out from the debrief
14:37 uh about pilot sightings of ufos we you
14:41 and i have talked about it publicly
14:42 before about these these
14:44 things were going on on the east coast
14:46 where navy pilots were flying out to a
14:47 training area and seeing
14:49 these strange objects daily pretty much
14:52 daily for an extended period of time and
14:53 then
14:54 i as as we have learned there was an
14:57 effort to get evidence to collect photos
14:59 or videos if possible so
15:01 we saw a story from the debrief about
15:03 these efforts and we
15:04 it was sort of teased that a photo was
15:06 going to be coming out and it was
15:07 released
15:08 and this photo of an object that looks
15:11 kind of strange and then a day or two
15:13 later
15:13 another photo gets released of a batman
15:16 type balloon that looks a lot like
15:18 the object in the photo and everyone has
15:20 a good chuckle and it is effectively
15:22 debunked can you speak about what you
15:25 know about that photo
15:26 and uh do you think they the that they
15:28 photographed the navy pilot photographed
15:30 a batman balloon
15:33 well uh let me yes boy that's a that's a
15:36 great question george
15:37 um unfortunately it's not as simple as
15:39 just a yes or no um
15:42 that what you're talking about here is a
15:44 photograph
15:45 um that was taken from inside a cockpit
15:48 of an f-18 15:50 super hornet by a personal personal
15:53 cellular
15:54 device someone's iphone if you will uh
15:58 but that wasn't the only one and if you
16:00 recall
16:01 for the last three years i've been
16:02 telling people you know we first talked
16:03 about the nimitz and people said well
16:04 that's in 2004 and i said yeah but
16:06 there's more
16:07 and then of course it got revealed about
16:09 the roosevelt incidents in 2015 and
16:11 people said well that's great but that's
16:13 you know
16:14 that's still 2015. and i said yeah but
16:16 that's not all
16:17 and here we have now again another one
16:20 about
16:21 uh recently very recently this last year
16:24 about some more of these incidents i
16:26 think it's important that we don't
16:28 look at each individual incident
16:32 we think we need to look at
16:35 the trend and what we have here going on
16:38 and is continuing by the way to this day
16:40 this is not just oh look what happened
16:42 last year
16:42 now this is happening even this year in
16:44 fact this has happened even
16:45 the last few months i'm not going to
16:48 elaborate but
16:49 again i don't think the audience should
16:50 be surprised that these incidents
16:53 are are occurring with a high degree of
16:55 frequency enough where we are
16:57 putting our taxpayer dollars to try to
16:59 figure these things out
17:00 so in this particular case if the object
17:02 was a a batman balloon then great we
17:04 figured it out
17:06 but there's other ones where we're we're
17:07 definitely not dealing with
17:09 with the balloon we're dealing with
17:10 something that is that is
17:12 far more technically advanced frankly
17:15 than anything we have in our inventory
17:17 and again i am confident that
17:20 information will eventually come to
17:21 light
17:22 i i am not going to speculate right now
17:25 what the government has or does not have
17:27 uh in the way of evidence
17:29 uh because again as i've always i've
17:32 always told people since 2017 17:34 i am no longer employed um by the us
17:37 government as a us government
17:38 representative on these matters
17:40 but the good news is that there are
17:42 people who are uh the
17:43 with the establishment recent
17:45 establishment of an actual uap
17:47 tax force right by the department of
17:50 defense
17:51 and now some proposed funding by
17:53 congress
17:54 you know we can we can hopefully get to
17:56 the bottom of this let's not forget it's
17:58 not just the united states that's
17:59 dealing with this
18:00 right um we're talking about other
18:02 countries as well
18:04 we just had japan recently jump on board
18:06 and say hey guess what
18:07 we want to work with you america uh
18:09 about the
18:10 about these ufo things you know because
18:13 i think we may have the same problem
18:15 so i think people need to to put this in
18:18 the greater context that what we're
18:19 seeing
18:20 here is you know in the intelligence
18:22 world
18:23 we used to have a little saying and if
18:25 that something happens if something
18:27 happens
18:27 once it's an anomaly if something
18:31 happens twice
18:32 it could be a coincidence but if it
18:34 happens three times now you're looking
18:36 at a trend
18:37 and what we see here most importantly is
18:39 a definitive
18:40 trend that there is something out there
18:44 that we do not understand that has the
18:46 capabilities to do things
18:48 and perform in ways that we currently
18:51 cannot
18:53 in this particular case the the
18:55 quote-unquote batman balloon that you're
18:56 referring to
18:58 uh there's still some conjecture whether
19:00 or not it is a balloon or not
19:02 um i really am rather agnostic i you
19:04 know let the experts decide if it's a
19:06 balloon or not
19:07 um but i think we're missing the point i
19:09 think the fact that we're now actually
19:11 able to have this conversation if the
19:12 government is taking this seriously
19:15 i think that is a a breath of fresh air
19:18 to this conversation this is what we
19:20 have been working for
19:21 this entire time and not just the last
19:24 three years when i left the government
19:25 but for the entire decade that i was
19:27 i was working this portfolio inside the
19:29 government and frankly
19:31 people that were working this portfolio
19:33 before me so
19:34 this is a tremendous success i don't
19:36 look at this as an embarrassment
19:38 at all i look at this as a you know okay
19:41 here's a case where
19:42 maybe we were able to to provide an
19:45 answer a solution
19:46 to to a problem well as you said
19:50 there are other photos um and
19:53 i don't know how high up of what
19:56 altitude
19:57 a toy balloon can go or how it can be
20:00 photographed on a cell phone of a guy
20:01 flying an f-18 at whatever the speed is
20:04 it seemed like that would be a tall task
20:06 to catch a little toy box
20:07 let's face it george it hasn't been
20:09 proven to be a balloon i mean there's
20:11 there's there's some aspects to it where
20:12 you can look and say yeah it vaguely
20:14 resembles
20:15 you know so to speak a batman balloon or
20:18 you know some sort of odd balloon
20:20 but there's just as many people out
20:21 there that say uh no actually it's not
20:24 if you were to
20:25 to improve the quality of the photo
20:28 i'll tell you what hold on lou i'm sorry
20:29 to interrupt you we'll have to come back
20:30 to that conversation i want to ask you
20:32 about a supposed triangle ufo photo
20:34 that's floating around out there
20:36 we're talking with lou elizondo about
20:39 his former job as head of
20:40 atip after he came forward helped the
20:43 new york times break this blockbuster
20:45 story
20:46 other news media around the world around
20:48 the country started covering the ufo
20:50 issue it was somehow more respectable
20:53 now that the new york times had done it
20:55 that had a and a subsequent effect of
20:58 making it uh acceptable for congress to
21:00 make inquiries there were
21:02 closed door briefings for members of
21:04 congress they uh
21:05 they've held many more briefings and
21:07 heard from multiple credible witnesses
21:09 including pilots
21:11 the u.s navy sort of led the way in
21:14 making it easier for pilots to make
21:16 these kinds of reports without worrying
21:18 about having their
21:19 uh their flying privileges taken away
21:22 because somebody might think they're
21:23 crazy a lot of things have happened as a
21:25 result of
21:26 blue coming forward and that story but
21:29 you have to ask
21:30 where is the air force in this why don't
21:32 we hear anything about
21:33 them they're the folks who ran project
21:35 blue book for all those years and
21:36 supposedly
21:37 are in charge of patrolling our skies
21:40 and protecting us from
21:41 things that come out of the sky
21:42 protecting our airspace we're going to
21:44 get into that with lou elizondo in a
21:46 moment and also ask about this
21:48 alleged photo that's floating around
21:50 that supposedly shows
21:51 a distinct triangular ufo right after it
21:55 emerges from the ocean and flies away
21:57 is that real we'll see if blue knows
21:59 we'll be right back
22:01 so lou elizondo before the break we're
22:03 talking about this particular
22:04 uh photo of a strange object uh
22:07 photographed on a cell phone by an f-18 22:09 pilot uh
22:10 how is it that that photo was classified
22:12 if the guy's using his personal cell
22:14 phone
22:16 well i think that's a great question
22:17 george you know people often ask well
22:19 when you classify something you're
22:20 protecting sources and methods and how
22:22 is it that a
22:23 commercial iphone that that you and i
22:25 and anybody else can buy and use
22:28 can be classified it doesn't make sense
22:30 well if
22:31 if someone if some in your audience
22:33 remember uh
22:34 not too long ago actually there was a
22:36 case a pretty high profile case where
22:38 there was a member of the united states
22:40 navy who happened to take his cell phone
22:43 on board with him on board a nuclear
22:45 submarine
22:46 i believe the individual was actually
22:48 assigned duties on a nuclear submarine
22:50 and he took a picture of him inside the
22:53 submarine
22:54 uh but it turned out that uh he was
22:57 prosecuted he was prosecuted because it
22:59 wasn't that the phone itself was
23:01 was classified it was the information
23:04 contained in the photograph that was
23:06 classified
23:07 um the fact that he took a picture
23:09 inside of a a restricted area
23:11 containing sensitive technology um
23:15 that was problematic for for the navy
23:17 and for the u.s government so
23:20 it's a great question people ask me all
23:21 the time how is it that a personal cell
23:23 phone device could be considered
23:25 classified
23:26 and it's it's really not it's not the
23:28 device itself
23:29 it's it's the data that is taken and the
23:32 data that is contained within the
23:34 photograph
23:35 of that device that is classified and
23:38 that is
23:39 uh that may very well be what the
23:41 rationale that they're using
23:43 uh regarding these particular
23:45 photographs
23:46 you've heard the story about the
23:47 triangular ufo just emerging from the
23:50 ocean supposedly there's a photo
23:52 taken under similar circumstances by a
23:54 navy pilot
23:55 supposed to be very clear uh and
23:57 dramatic uh it's
23:58 that story has been floating around i'm
24:00 not asking you this
24:02 as somebody who might have classified
24:04 information about it but as a ufo
24:05 investigator you working on the
24:07 tv series under identifying and working
24:09 with ttsa have you made
24:11 inquiries about that do you believe such
24:13 a photo exists
24:15 yeah i i well put it simply yes i'm i'm
24:18 confident it is you know there's been
24:20 some confusion within the government
24:22 uh whether that photograph is real or
24:24 whether or not that event even took
24:25 place
24:26 um i can tell you through without giving
24:29 away sources of course
24:30 um i've spoken to individuals who
24:33 have access to specific classified
24:35 systems
24:36 and they have uh they have absolutely
24:40 and unequivocally expressed the validity
24:43 of that that photograph in fact it may
24:47 actually be a video
24:48 um and you know the photograph is simply
24:50 a still
24:51 uh from uh from a longer a longer video
24:55 now the question remains why is it
24:58 that uh if that if if that is real
25:01 why are people acting very cagey within
25:04 the government
25:05 um i don't know maybe maybe we have
25:08 taken disclosure a little bit
25:09 too far maybe we've rubbed up against
25:11 something that's a little bit too
25:12 sensitive
25:14 that the us government isn't prepared to
25:16 have the conversation about right now
25:18 i don't really know this there's lots of
25:20 different reasons
25:22 could it be that only certain enclaves
25:25 had
25:26 access to this uh information while
25:28 others didn't and it's embarrassing now
25:30 because you know obviously it looks like
25:31 we're not talking to
25:33 each other and to ourselves there's a
25:35 whole host of reasons i don't want to
25:37 speculate
25:38 uh for you what those reasons could be
25:41 because
25:42 you know frankly it could be all of the
25:43 above or could be none of this above
25:45 um but to put it simply yes i am
25:48 absolutely 100 25:49 confident that that is a very real event
25:52 um
25:53 but again i would also emphasize let's
25:55 not just focus on that
25:57 um because these events are occurring uh
26:00 continually
26:01 they're happening all the time and if we
26:04 if we we run the risk like we did with
26:07 with the last time with the nimitz and
26:09 with the roosevelt if we focus on a
26:11 single event or a single
26:12 incident then we we begin to lose
26:15 focus and we wind up focusing on on the
26:18 tree rather than the entire forest
26:21 and and i think that's what's important
26:22 this is why
26:24 i always encourage people you know look
26:26 it's interesting and anecdotal to to
26:28 look at a particular event
26:29 but what we're really interested in is
26:31 the trend we're looking at the the
26:33 similarities and congruencies
26:35 of many events over over a long period
26:38 of time
26:39 and that's really the art of
26:40 intelligence remember what i said look
26:42 at something once it's an anomaly twice
26:44 it could be a coincidence
26:46 we're really trying to focus on the
26:47 trend and
26:49 as a reporter right you're an
26:50 investigative reporter and
26:52 and frankly a damn good one um you don't
26:54 look at just
26:55 one thing you look at many many
26:58 different
26:58 data points in order to to develop a
27:02 story
27:02 to vet that story to cooperate that
27:04 story and so that would be my same
27:06 advice to
27:07 to the audience you know let's let's
27:09 keep an open mind and remember that
27:11 you're only hearing about an event that
27:14 the debrief
27:15 publicized but for every event that the
27:18 debrief has publicized by the way they
27:20 did a really good job with it
27:22 there's a whole bunch of others that go
27:24 uh
27:25 below the radar and most americans have
27:27 have no idea you know there's
27:29 there was a recent movie george called
27:31 the phenomenon
27:32 uh and i believe it was uh directed by
27:34 james fox
27:35 and produced by by a gentleman named dan
27:37 farah but if you want to
27:39 just kind of get a just kind of a a
27:41 brief historical snapshot of the
27:43 phenomenon
27:44 i would suggest you know to take a quick
27:46 look at that movie um
27:48 you know it's it's pretty compelling and
27:49 it kind of shows you through a temporal
27:51 perspective you know a time perspective
27:54 that this is not just an
27:55 incident that occurred let's say you
27:57 know over the
27:59 uh pacific ocean near san diego in 2004 28:02 or in this case
28:03 over the atlantic ocean in 2019 this has
28:05 been occurring for a very long time
28:08 decades and decades and uh we we're
28:11 finally at a point where we as a
28:12 government are finally taking this
28:14 seriously and by the way not just our
28:15 government
28:16 we know other governments are too so
28:19 that would be my uh that would be my
28:20 advice
28:21 the the u.s navy has really led the way
28:24 and
28:25 you know that astonishing announcement
28:27 more than a year ago saying we're going
28:28 to change policy and make it easier for
28:30 our pilots to report these things
28:32 without worrying that we might
28:34 uh stop them from flying or or their
28:36 career might be halted something like
28:37 that i don't know if that policy was
28:39 implemented but i know that you know
28:42 some pilots are cooperating that for a
28:44 while
28:45 what i was hearing was that these things
28:46 were being seen off the east coast
28:48 every day as the navy pilots would fly
28:50 by it so i imagine
28:52 there are pilots who cooperate and some
28:54 who
28:55 aren't quite sure they want to get
28:57 caught up in this still and are afraid
28:59 of doing it what i don't know is where's
29:02 the air force on this
29:03 why is it just the navy is it just we're
29:05 not hearing about the air force are they
29:07 they're not going along with the program
29:09 what do you think
29:11 well let me give you my personal
29:13 perspective i don't
29:14 typically like to offer my opinion
29:16 because you know what people say about
29:18 opinions so and i'm sure mine is
29:20 probably no different
29:21 uh but i will share with you my thoughts
29:24 on this um only because i asked the same
29:26 question when i was in asic
29:28 where why is there that why is there
29:31 this echo
29:33 when we inquire about uaps with the air
29:35 force and
29:36 i've come to to to a personal
29:40 belief that the air force has backed
29:43 itself
29:44 into a corner to some degree the air
29:46 force is expected by our country to be
29:49 the very best in the sky to have air
29:51 dominance and to protect our country
29:53 from from anything that's that's you
29:55 know within
29:56 two inches above the ground up to up to
29:59 you know low earth orbit
30:00 and beyond uh they are they own the
30:03 airspace and they're supposed to own the
30:05 airspace
30:07 they spent a lot of time on blue book
30:09 and they said publicly that there's
30:10 nothing to see here folks
30:12 um if it turns out that there really is
30:15 something to see here
30:16 then people are gonna start asking the
30:18 air force some very difficult
30:20 questions and that is okay then first of
30:22 all why were you wrong before
30:24 and if you weren't wrong then you know
30:27 uh
30:28 were you purposely making an excuse were
30:32 you deceiving the american people
30:34 you know today's air force is not
30:35 yesterday's air force
30:37 um 99.999 percent of the people in the
30:40 air force are
30:41 incredibly competent human beings um
30:44 but like any other organization
30:46 bureaucracy tends to be the devil here
30:49 and the air force has a lot of
30:51 bureaucracy just like every other
30:52 service
30:53 and unfortunately the bureaucracy is is
30:56 composed of people who don't even
30:58 necessarily have air force experience
31:00 not even military experiences a lot of
31:01 these people are civilians or the
31:03 special appointees
31:04 and and they are they are by by
31:07 definition
31:08 political appointees now let's take that
31:10 definition for a minute political
31:12 appointee what does that mean
31:13 that means somebody who has been
31:14 appointed in a position based upon
31:18 either political affiliation or
31:20 political service
31:21 they have been serving a politician
31:24 not necessarily a military leader and so
31:28 politicians make decisions usually based
31:30 upon
31:31 politics and in this particular case
31:34 that may
31:34 very well be the case with the air force
31:36 maybe there was a lot of pressure
31:38 uh in the past for the air force to have
31:40 a reason can you imagine at the height
31:42 of the cold war if the air force said
31:43 yeah we don't know what these things are
31:45 um
31:46 how that would bode with the american
31:48 people especially the fact that you know
31:50 we're we're toe to toe with with the
31:52 russians and and they've got nuclear
31:54 weapons we've got nuclear weapons
31:56 and uh you know that that that probably
31:58 wouldn't wouldn't go over very well
32:01 um so i i don't want to i don't want to
32:05 disparage the air force because they are
32:07 extremely
32:08 competent uh but the air force is no
32:11 different than any other service that
32:12 i've ever worked with
32:14 and unfortunately bureaucracy and
32:15 politics does have
32:17 have some some play in what they do
32:20 let's talk about the uap
32:21 task force to the extent that you can
32:23 it's amazing that that
32:26 that program exists that it is
32:28 acknowledged and on the record it's
32:29 giving briefings to members of congress
32:31 i i've been hurt told different stories
32:33 about how much personnel how much budget
32:36 that they've been waiting
32:37 on this defense authorization bill to to
32:39 get past so they have some
32:41 room to grow and and expand and uh can
32:44 you give me your assessment of where
32:45 they are how it's going and
32:47 and what the future holds for the task
32:49 force are you encouraged
32:50 yeah sure first of all the the
32:53 individuals that are currently assigned
32:54 to the task force um
32:56 i've had the honor and pleasure of of
32:58 serving with i i know
32:59 i know most of them personally and they
33:01 are outstanding human beings but
33:03 look i i gotta have this conversation by
33:06 by also saying
33:07 i i think we need to tamper our
33:09 expectations
33:10 as i've said for the last three years
33:12 this is a process
33:14 not an event and we're asking the us
33:16 government to engage in something that
33:18 historically
33:19 never wanted to engage in in the past
33:21 publicly
33:22 and so to some degree i think a lot of
33:24 people have these
33:25 these false hopes that you know
33:27 disclosure is here and all of a sudden
33:28 we're gonna
33:29 we're gonna have this huge announcement
33:30 by the us government it's a little bit
33:33 it's it's it's christmas season right so
33:34 it's like telling someone they're gonna
33:36 get a rolls royce for christmas
33:38 and you know really anything less than a
33:40 rolls royce under the christmas tree is
33:42 going to be a disappointment
33:44 and when in reality if people would just
33:46 i think
33:47 sit back a little bit and relax take a
33:49 breath
33:50 and and maybe they would appreciate
33:54 you know the cadillac that they actually
33:56 got under the tree a lot more
33:57 um i think i think we need to
34:01 give credit where credit is due now
34:03 could the task force be
34:04 far more robust and be funded yes but
34:07 let's not forget congress is trying to
34:09 fund them
34:09 let's not forget look in three years
34:11 george if you don't mind i'd like to
34:13 recap just very quickly
34:15 how far we've come in three years
34:16 because people always say oh you know
34:18 there's nothing new here nothing that we
34:20 haven't already known but but let's just
34:22 let's be fair here in the last three
34:24 years you had
34:25 three videos released that were on u.s
34:28 government systems you had three videos
34:30 confirmed
34:32 to be authentic by the us government you
34:34 have three videos that detect
34:36 truly anomalous characteristics as
34:39 by the way admitted by the us government
34:42 you have the u.s government admitting
34:43 that a-tip was real
34:45 you have you had the u.s government
34:47 admitting at various stages that
34:49 atip studied uaps you have senior
34:51 members of congress
34:53 acknowledging atyp was real you have
34:55 classified as you said
34:57 classified briefings being provided to
34:59 key congressional
35:00 members and their staff you have the
35:02 establishment of a uap
35:04 task force you have military
35:05 eyewitnesses coming out now in public
35:08 having the conversation and you have
35:11 other countries like japan
35:12 now wanted to share their uap
35:15 information
35:16 with the united states you have major
35:18 media outlets
35:19 now reporting on and taking seriously
35:23 the uap
35:23 topic and last but not least let's not
35:26 forget what happened this week
35:28 you had the former head of the cia the
35:31 director himself come out and say
35:34 yeah these things are real and oh by the
35:36 way you know
35:37 america you might want to prepare
35:39 yourself that these things
35:41 they might not be from here so in three
35:44 years george
35:45 we have come collectively very very far
35:50 and i think people who don't recognize
35:53 that
35:54 probably suffer from a bit of amnesia
35:56 we've come
35:57 light years excuse a pun here but we've
35:59 come we've come very very far
36:01 in three years more so than we have
36:03 perhaps since in the last 70.
36:05 um the the establishment of the task
36:07 force is a monumental it's not a
36:09 herculean effort
36:11 and a success you have the us government
36:14 saying yes
36:14 ufos are real and we are establishing a
36:17 task force
36:18 to tackle this very problem you have
36:20 members of congress coming out and
36:22 saying hey
36:22 we know these things are real and by the
36:24 way they might not be from here either
36:27 so um that's i i can't
36:30 imagine a time in history uh you know
36:33 maybe uh
36:34 maybe i'm young but i don't know a time
36:36 when we've ever had this conversation
36:38 before like this
36:39 so openly and the media is willing to
36:42 report on it and the american people are
36:43 willing to have the conversation
36:45 about this i'm right there with you i i
36:47 never thought i would see this in my
36:49 lifetime it's just an amazing amount of
36:51 progress made in three years and
36:53 again i never thought i'd see it there
36:55 are
36:56 there are challenges ahead though so
36:58 that the task force is plugging away
37:00 once it gets fully funded it can it can
37:02 it can do its work
37:03 it has to report to congress and i know
37:06 i can imagine that when dave fravor
37:08 comes over to give a briefing
37:09 to the senate staff and then to elected
37:12 members
37:12 and then other pilots and people like
37:14 yourself come over
37:16 that probably became a pretty hot ticket
37:18 on capitol hill
37:19 um what what happens when uh all these
37:22 members of congress start getting
37:24 briefings when the uap task force is up
37:26 to speed and
37:27 and submitting reports on a regular
37:28 basis do you have to worry about
37:30 too many uh chefs in the kitchen do you
37:32 have to worry about leaks coming from
37:34 congress
37:36 well i i wouldn't worry about leaves
37:38 coming from congress congress's
37:39 job is to inform the american public
37:41 about important things
37:43 um if if congress tells the american
37:45 people something then then it's probably
37:47 for a good reason
37:49 i trust congress to do its job it's not
37:52 perfect
37:53 you know no organization is but i will
37:56 tell you for example folks like marco
37:57 rubio
37:59 in this particular case he's absolutely
38:00 right he wants to have the conversation
38:02 he wants to fund it he says look i don't
38:03 know what these things are
38:05 uh and the fact that we don't know what
38:06 they are and our best and our brightest
38:08 in our government don't know what these
38:09 are
38:10 we probably better figure it out um i
38:12 think i think that's a very fair and
38:14 rational way to look at this topic and
38:16 let's not forget that harry reid
38:18 more than a decade ago and and senator
38:21 inuae and stevens they all felt the same
38:24 way
38:24 they said hey look we know these things
38:26 are here we're collecting them on our
38:28 systems and and people are turning a
38:31 blind eye
38:32 um now here's where the the problem
38:34 arises george
38:35 and i think it's a good point you make
38:38 there comes a time
38:39 when a task force by definition is a
38:42 temporary
38:43 um it's a temporary entity that is
38:46 established for a very specific purpose
38:49 what we need here is not necessarily a
38:51 task force a task force is a great start
38:54 but what we need here is an enduring
38:56 capability something that's going to be
38:58 around for a really long
39:00 time that's going to be fully funded
39:02 maybe under the construct of a space
39:04 force maybe under the construct of the
39:06 air force or even the navy or maybe even
39:08 under the director of national
39:09 intelligence or even the vice president
39:11 perhaps
39:13 we need to have an enduring capability
39:15 that will look at this problem
39:17 and put america's best and brightest
39:19 from academics and
39:20 academics and scientists and
39:24 hard-nosed researchers that's that's
39:27 what we need here
39:28 i think i want to expand on that we have
39:30 to take a break i want to expand on that
39:32 ask you about whether you'd go back if
39:34 they established a program like that
39:36 whether you go back and work on it and
39:38 about the future of ttsa a lot of
39:40 stories floating around about to the
39:41 stars academy and what's going on there
39:43 we're going to get into that and more

==========K3LBTGVIAZs==========

00:10 in october of 2017 00:13 this counter intelligence officer and
00:15 trained special agent by the name of
00:17 luis elizondo
00:18 stepped out of the shadowed halls of the
00:20 pentagon and in
00:22 to the public spotlight whether he
00:24 intended it or not
00:26 by doing so he would become an instant
00:28 celebrity to ufo
00:30 enthusiasts for saying something that
00:32 would soon
00:33 shake the entire world for nearly the
00:35 last decade i ran a sensitive aerospace
00:37 threat identification program focusing
00:39 on unidentified aerial technologies
00:43 it was in this position i learned
00:46 that the phenomenon is indeed real
00:49 within minutes of speaking these words
00:52 the black vault used this once insider
00:54 information
00:55 to file numerous freedom of information
00:57 act requests
00:58 to see what documents could be dug up
01:02 the idea was that in the eyes of the law
01:04 if this former government agent was
01:06 talking about it
01:07 then the documents may just be ripe for
01:10 the picken if one were to ask for
01:12 them so that's exactly what i did
01:16 this unfolding saga brought me hope that
01:19 after more than 20 years of pushing for
01:21 the truth
01:22 the veil of secrecy surrounding the ufo
01:24 phenomenon
01:25 might just be lifting once and for all
01:27 and things
01:28 were drastically changing evidence of
01:32 that change was revealed just two months
01:34 after elizondo stepped foot on that
01:36 stage
01:37 that is when the mainstream media
01:38 covered elizondo
01:40 along with his story and it became a
01:42 viral sensation
01:44 all over the world up front now the
01:46 former pentagon military official who
01:47 ran the covert government program up
01:48 until this last november
01:50 luis elizondo louise thank you so much
01:52 for your time tonight
01:54 until he stepped out on stage last
01:56 october alongside
01:57 rock star tom delong and other former
02:00 government insiders
02:01 most of the world had never heard of
02:03 luis elizondo
02:04 which is how he liked it
02:08 but as excitement exploded worldwide
02:11 about this secret pentagon ufo study
02:13 known
02:14 as the advanced aerospace threat
02:16 identification program
02:18 or atip controversy had already begun to
02:21 percolate
02:22 inside the black vault about what was
02:25 really going on
02:28 just three weeks prior to the new york
02:29 times running their now world famous
02:31 headline
02:32 the pentagon told the black vault they
02:34 had no records on
02:36 any program that elizondo had described
02:39 not a single piece of evidence
02:41 whatsoever
02:43 a couple months after that the navy
02:45 denied they gave anything to the atip
02:47 program
02:48 despite what elizondo had claimed and
02:51 then just months after that
02:53 the pentagon issued a statement that was
02:55 the most damning of all
02:57 they claimed that elizondo had no
02:58 assigned responsibilities on the atip
03:00 program
03:01 that he had brought into the spotlight
03:04 as the months and years passed since the
03:06 initial headlines
03:08 the black vault became highly critical
03:10 of elizondo's claims
03:11 this is not a popular stance to take and
03:14 as social media can easily prove
03:16 that type of stance can come with a
03:18 little bit of heat
03:21 but it wasn't just elizondo on the
03:23 receiving end of criticism
03:24 the pentagon and the entire us
03:26 government has had a history
03:28 of covering up ufo data for decades and
03:31 it appeared
03:32 that's exactly what they may be doing
03:34 again but to what extent
03:38 my guest today is the man who started it
03:40 all luis elizondo himself
03:44 despite the black vault's criticism and
03:46 admittedly the nitpicking of every
03:48 single detail
03:48 in order to find the absolute truth
03:51 elizondo has agreed to step into the
03:53 vault
03:53 and share his side of the story in a
03:55 special one-on-one interview
03:58 stay tuned you're about to journey
04:00 inside the black vault
04:15 [Music]
04:42 that's right everybody as always thank
04:43 you so much for tuning in and making
04:45 this your podcast or
04:47 your live stream of choice i'm your host
04:49 john greenwald jr
04:50 and to say that i am well beyond excited
04:53 about
04:53 the next hour or so uh that would be an
04:56 understatement
04:57 i've been looking forward to doing this
04:59 with my guest
05:00 doing a sit down for quite some time now
05:02 i guess approaching
05:03 probably about three years and he has
05:06 been
05:06 nothing but gracious and a gentleman
05:09 despite
05:10 my high criticism and my skepticism
05:13 about some things that have come out i
05:15 don't want to waste any time i want to
05:17 bring on
05:18 to the show mr luis elizondo i
05:21 really on behalf of everybody watching
05:23 and listening thank you for taking the
05:25 time today to talk to all of us
05:27 well john thank you i appreciate it very
05:29 much um you know i
05:31 i certainly appreciate your audience as
05:33 well uh
05:34 and i and i don't say this frivolously
05:37 and i've told
05:38 you this before privately you have
05:40 managed to do
05:41 things uh in this this arena
05:44 that very few other individuals have uh
05:47 have ever been able to accomplish
05:48 particularly you're working in foia um
05:51 you know
05:52 for those who may not know foia freedom
05:54 of information act was enacted in order
05:56 to
05:56 ensure transparency for the american
05:59 public into government um
06:01 workings if you will because in the past
06:03 there had been some
06:05 some issues with that where the
06:06 government may have overstepped its its
06:08 authorities
06:09 and as a result so congress enacts foia
06:12 process
06:12 and i think there has probably never
06:14 been anybody who has sat
06:16 who has been as savvy in the foia
06:18 process uh
06:20 than you so thank you also for what you
06:22 do it's sincerely appreciated
06:25 i know not just for folks like me but on
06:27 behalf of everybody out there
06:29 your work in over the past well past few
06:31 decades really has been
06:32 been pretty incredible i i really
06:35 appreciate those kind words and as my
06:37 audience is already seeing
06:39 and i'll say it again despite that that
06:41 that
06:42 skepticism from me you have always been
06:44 that that gentleman and a scholar you've
06:46 always been
06:47 open to me you've spoken to me on the
06:50 telephone and now you're doing this
06:52 uh but but i i want to return that
06:54 respect to you and i hope everybody
06:55 realizes that i've
06:56 tried to say that on social media uh but
06:59 also the fact that you're here
07:00 and and i want this as kind of a
07:02 housekeeping note for those listening
07:04 and watching
07:04 i ask all my guests this and all of them
07:07 can attest to it
07:08 however i did ask the same question to
07:10 you which was
07:12 is there anything you don't want me to
07:13 go into and you have never once
07:16 told me even though i've asked you i've
07:18 quadruple checked that
07:19 uh through the last few months as we've
07:21 set this up you've never once
07:22 said nope don't go here nope don't go
07:24 there you've always said the same thing
07:26 which was
07:27 everything's on the table so my respect
07:29 to you for that
07:30 and for being here and let's just kind
07:32 of jump right right into it
07:34 what i want to do and how i structured
07:35 this interview is essentially take a
07:37 chronological look at some of
07:39 uh maybe some stuff that you've already
07:41 talked about but also filling in the
07:43 holes some
07:44 questions may be a little bit sensitive
07:46 we might get into some areas where you
07:47 go sorry john i ain't going to talk to
07:49 you about that
07:50 uh and and and so i'll apologize if in
07:53 advance if i start pushing those buttons
07:55 uh but that's who i am i have to push
07:57 him so take me back to the beginning if
07:59 you could
08:00 on how you became involved in atip and
08:03 exactly how that came to be
08:07 yeah i'm going to do that but before i
08:09 do that john let me also offer one
08:11 one mia copelan apology also to you and
08:14 i'm not sure that
08:15 that we really ever had a chance to
08:17 address this but the bottom line is that
08:19 years ago you try i try to make myself
08:21 as approachable as possible
08:23 and years ago i i know several years ago
08:26 you tried to reach out
08:27 and um try to have a conversation with
08:30 me
08:31 and unfortunately that message never got
08:33 to me and
08:34 uh i i want to apologize because i do i
08:37 do think we should have probably had
08:38 this conversation three years ago
08:40 and uh probably every year after that as
08:43 well
08:44 and because that information never got
08:47 to me
08:48 um unfortunately we never gave you
08:51 a reply or response that you deserved
08:53 and so i want to
08:54 i want to say here and now i'm really
08:56 really sorry we never had a chance to do
08:58 this earlier
08:59 i think this conversation is a long time
09:02 company
09:02 coming and i i really do appreciate
09:04 sincerely your patience
09:05 thus far i promise you it was not
09:08 intentional on my part
09:09 um i just never knew you had even
09:11 inquired to speak with me
09:13 until after you know we actually had
09:15 talked the first time and you had said
09:16 hey lou i've been trying to get ahold of
09:17 you for
09:18 you know x amount of months and and i
09:21 had no idea
09:22 so i i want to apologize here you know
09:24 on air just so
09:25 so you know that was never intentional
09:27 well i appreciate that
09:28 no you somebody taught me a long time
09:30 ago you don't know what you don't know
09:32 and there's no need to apologize but
09:33 accept it anyway but i appreciate you
09:36 pointing that out thank you
09:38 so back to atip how did i get involved
09:41 um
09:42 let's rewind the clock to about 2008.
09:44 and i'll give you kind of the
09:45 synopsis of how all this evolved i was
09:48 working uh prior to that
09:50 at the uh office of the director of
09:51 national intelligence
09:53 uh i was a uh senior intelligence
09:55 officer working
09:56 um policy strategy things like that
09:59 and to me quite frankly uh frank with
10:01 you the the drive was killing me i was
10:03 living on maryland's eastern shore at
10:04 the time
10:05 and you're looking at a three-hour
10:06 commute one way um i loved my job i love
10:09 the people but the commute was killing
10:10 me
10:11 so at the time um it was then under
10:15 secretary of defense for intelligence
10:16 jim clapper was over at the usdi
10:19 and he was the under secretary of
10:21 defense for intelligence at the time
10:23 uh and a man i respected greatly and i
10:26 was given an opportunity to come back to
10:28 dod
10:28 for about a year to to work some
10:32 some new efforts particularly in
10:34 intelligence sharing law enforcement
10:35 information integration
10:37 and so i i came back very eager because
10:39 my
10:40 my daily commute was cut about in half
10:42 all of a sudden
10:43 uh and i had my a little bit more of my
10:45 life back so i went back to dod
10:48 and it was at that time i was working um
10:51 in the national capital region ncr
10:53 region where
10:54 um some people had come to my to my desk
10:57 we were working i wasn't in
10:58 the pentagon at the time we were working
11:00 at a remote location but still connected
11:02 to the pentagon
11:04 and uh you know it's it's it's kind of
11:06 bizarre because like out of a movie
11:09 um these two people i still remember
11:10 today very clearly from what they were
11:12 wearing
11:12 very nicely dressed uh and um i remember
11:15 someone knocking on the door and said mr
11:17 alexander
11:17 there's some people here to see you
11:18 which which is not uncommon you you're
11:20 always working issues
11:22 so you're trying to fix things uh so
11:24 sure bring them on and they came in
11:25 and uh they said hey uh you're you're
11:29 luis alexander and yes i am lou uh can
11:32 we talk to you
11:33 and i said sure and one of them shut the
11:35 door behind them my door
11:37 i'm like okay this is probably not good
11:40 you know
11:40 uh i often joke you know what did i do
11:42 now right um
11:44 i probably upset somebody and uh they
11:47 sat down
11:47 and uh they started to say you know hey
11:50 look uh we we are part of the
11:52 intelligence community
11:53 uh we're part of a program we're not
11:55 going to tell you much about it but
11:57 uh do you mind telling us a little bit
11:58 about yourself and
12:00 uh i i probably was a little rude i
12:02 probably was a little bit standoffish
12:04 because i don't particularly like
12:06 talking about myself especially if i
12:07 don't know who you are
12:09 um and they start asking very pointy
12:11 questions
12:12 specifically about you know we hear that
12:13 you're you're you're a
12:14 counterintelligence guy we hear that you
12:16 did some background uh before
12:18 you have some background uh in advanced
12:20 avionics and aerospace industry
12:23 uh is that true yes do you mind sharing
12:25 with us i said well i'll share with you
12:27 at the unclassified level the type of
12:29 systems i've worked on but i'm really
12:30 not comfortable going into
12:31 more detail it's a long story short they
12:34 agreed to
12:35 to they would come back and have another
12:37 discussion with me um
12:39 and so when they left i ran some trap
12:41 lines to find out that they were legit
12:43 they were part of a special
12:44 program but i didn't have clearance into
12:47 it so i really didn't know but
12:48 they really were who they said they were
12:49 they were part of a small organization
12:52 i presume that the time had something to
12:53 do with aerospace
12:55 but i really didn't know and then a
12:57 couple more trips they came by we talked
12:59 got a little bit more comfortable they
13:01 got more comfortable with me i certainly
13:02 got more comfortable with them
13:03 and finally they said we'd like to uh
13:05 have you meet
13:06 our director i said okay sure no problem
13:10 uh it might have been john probably
13:14 seven or ten days later we i had an
13:16 appointment to go
13:17 meet that i was hoping the director
13:18 would come see me
13:20 i thought i was sufficiently senior
13:22 enough where you know you want to come
13:23 see me you can come see me instead
13:25 they're like okay be at this location at
13:27 this time at this place and don't tell
13:28 anybody you're coming
13:30 uh so again a little bit unusual i'm
13:32 like you know i'm sorry who are you
13:34 so i decided to go ahead and do it and
13:37 uh i told my deputy that time hey i'm
13:38 gonna go
13:39 go to this meeting um i went to it and
13:42 uh it was an undisclosed location in
13:44 also the national capital region
13:46 uh bit just like a normal office
13:48 building really uh until you go inside
13:49 then you realize that you have
13:51 you know guards and whatnot you're like
13:53 okay no this is probably a little bit
13:54 more more sensitive
13:56 i remember going up the elevator up to
13:58 the floor and uh it looked like a
14:00 it looked like an office building you
14:02 would see like on wall street really
14:04 um you know cubicles all over the place
14:06 and people kind of
14:08 making copies and doing work diligently
14:10 on their computers
14:11 and there was this corner office um kind
14:14 of looked like a
14:16 glass you know the individual sitting
14:17 back in there and what struck me is that
14:19 the individual
14:20 was i don't want to stereotype but if
14:24 you would ever think of what a rocket
14:25 scientist looks like
14:27 he was your quintessential rocket
14:29 scientist glasses
14:31 uh you know very very look look appeared
14:34 very astute
14:35 um and very no-nonsense um so
14:38 i went i introduced myself shook his
14:41 hand hey i'm glad you're here
14:42 he didn't smile he was just very serious
14:44 and he was
14:46 man he looked at me he was staring at me
14:48 i i felt almost a little uncomfortable
14:50 because i know he was assessing the hell
14:52 out of me
14:53 and i was trying to assess him as well
14:54 but obviously he probably knew a little
14:56 bit more about me than i knew about him
14:58 uh which is never really good to go into
15:00 a meeting like that as an intelligence
15:01 officer you know you
15:03 kind of want to if you will know thy
15:05 enemy uh not saying he was my enemy by
15:07 any stretch but
15:08 you know you wonder who you're dealing
15:09 with uh and he introduced himself
15:12 and um i'm sure at some point his name
15:15 will become
15:15 become very public i i have i have out
15:18 of respect for him i've never mentioned
15:19 his name uh he's asked me never to
15:21 mention it uh
15:22 until he's comfortable with with his
15:24 name being out so i won't
15:26 um but we talked we had a very good
15:28 candid conversation
15:30 and that's when he asked me i mean he
15:32 started he started asking me about my
15:33 background
15:33 in uh in aerospace and the type of
15:36 technologies i worked on
15:38 and um you know this is a guy who i
15:42 really he knew his stuff
15:43 and he was like literally a rock
15:44 literally by definition a rocket
15:46 scientist
15:46 and probably one of the best ones that
15:48 we had in the government um
15:50 and that's when you know he asked me
15:52 said what do you what do you think about
15:54 um man it was you know john he he looked
15:57 him straight in the face
15:59 and looking back it's it was so weird
16:01 because i wasn't sure if he was like
16:02 testing me
16:03 or if it was legit but he said what do
16:05 you think about the topic of ufos
16:08 now coming from my world you know we'll
16:11 to test somebody we will use provocative
16:14 statements sometimes and then gauge
16:16 their body language and you know micro
16:17 behaviors and neural linguistics
16:19 uh to see if you know they're prone to
16:21 you know
16:22 flights of fancy and things like that
16:24 you know and uh
16:26 but he he was he was looking to be very
16:27 serious and they said well i i
16:30 i don't really think about ufos he says
16:33 what you don't think they're real i said
16:34 no no i didn't say that i just
16:36 i never really had the luxury to think
16:38 about ufos you know i'm not particularly
16:40 a huge science fiction fan i
16:41 never really watched x-files or anything
16:43 like that uh
16:45 and i've been so consumed with my work
16:47 that when i'm not working i'm at home
16:49 and i'm a father but those are really
16:51 the only things i ever have time for
16:52 work and and which didn't involve
16:54 anything at all involving some of those
16:56 clearly and um and and raising a family
17:01 so he said okay that's that's fair um
17:04 and he said but let me let me uh just
17:06 caution you
17:07 to caution you or warn you something to
17:09 that effect let me caution you
17:11 that um don't let your analytic bias
17:15 get in the way he said you're gonna
17:19 you're gonna see things that you may not
17:21 you may have a hard time reconciling now
17:23 at this point i hadn't even accepted it
17:24 i didn't i hadn't been offered even
17:26 really a job right so
17:28 i'm thinking to myself are you are you
17:30 is this a pitch are you offering me a
17:31 job
17:32 or this just is this just advice for
17:34 life you know to take with me and
17:36 what what the hell is really going on
17:37 here so
17:39 uh i nodded my head and said no you know
17:41 very very fair point right
17:44 i don't really have an opinion yet on it
17:46 and then we agreed
17:47 uh have another conversation but he said
17:49 look i'm looking for a
17:50 counterintelligence guy
17:51 um for for those in your audience you
17:54 may not know what really
17:55 counterintelligence is you know a lot of
17:56 people
17:57 think they know what ci is ci is is
18:00 really um
18:01 knowing what the enemy knows about you
18:03 right so so foreign intelligence
18:05 collection
18:05 is is learning what the bad guys know
18:08 counter intelligence is knowing what the
18:09 bad guys know about you so if you think
18:11 of a chess board
18:12 um if you are playing chess against an
18:15 opponent
18:16 um you know foreign intelligence is
18:19 knowing what their pieces can do on the
18:21 chess board and how they plan to move
18:23 counterintelligence is knowing what they
18:24 know about your pieces right and how you
18:26 can move so
18:28 uh it's it's yet another layer of of
18:31 of playing chess to some degree i guess
18:33 um you know not any better or worse in
18:34 other
18:35 forms of intelligence it's just it's a
18:36 very niche uh
18:38 way of doing business uh from an
18:40 intelligence perspective
18:42 so uh he started looking for a
18:43 counterintelligence guy um
18:45 because we know that there are some
18:46 foreign countries foreign adversaries
18:47 out there that that
18:48 probably know what we're doing and i i
18:51 need a good
18:52 counterintelligence and security program
18:54 which by the way it's not unusual um
18:56 anytime you have a sensitive program
18:58 uh you know you you want to have you
19:00 want to have good security and counter
19:02 intelligence expertise it's just
19:04 it's just an extra layer of if you will
19:06 um
19:07 insurance to have to protect your
19:10 program
19:10 so it wasn't unusual that i was that i
19:12 was being asked to provide
19:13 counterintelligence expertise i wasn't
19:15 being asked to do anything with ufos per
19:17 se
19:18 it was just to come in and provide you
19:19 know the background that i already have
19:21 just use that in this capacity
19:24 so um ultimately long story short of it
19:27 obviously the rest is history uh
19:28 no pun intended i i i secure i'll
19:32 i'll accept the job um and it was at
19:35 that point
19:35 um through through various conversations
19:38 afterwards i began to realize that
19:40 these guys are legit they're real i mean
19:42 they have like real data
19:43 and uh the individuals that they started
19:46 that were part of this effort i knew
19:48 from before
19:49 like people like how put off and whatnot
19:51 that were you know there were kind of
19:52 legends in their own time anyways
19:54 um so i knew this was a serious
19:57 legitimate effort and then i began to
19:58 see the documentation
20:00 uh from the senate and congress and i
20:03 really began to
20:04 recognize that this was a full-fledged
20:06 program but they really did need
20:08 counter-intelligence expertise they
20:09 didn't have anything
20:10 so they were kind of they were kind of
20:11 vulnerable from that perspective
20:14 um yeah i know it's probably a
20:17 long-winded explanation no that's okay
20:20 yeah yeah yeah no i appreciate it
20:21 because i want the the groundwork here
20:23 now um in this next question i want you
20:26 to kind of clarify you could do it
20:27 quickly uh
20:28 if you could the difference between what
20:31 we
20:32 learned of the advanced aerospace uh
20:35 weapons uh now i'm drawing yeah thank
20:38 you the asap program then i get
20:40 tongue tied versus the program that you
20:42 joined that you just described the
20:44 advanced
20:44 aerospace threat identification program
20:46 or atip what was the difference between
20:49 the two because this has been
20:51 an area of much confusion not only by
20:53 myself
20:54 but it seems like those that even worked
20:56 on the program which i'll explain in a
20:58 moment
20:58 absolutely not not only you but i mean
21:00 honestly probably to all of us that's to
21:02 some degree in the beginning
21:03 so in the in the in the very beginning
21:05 days there was very little difference
21:07 between offset
21:08 there really wasn't a a a clear line
21:11 distinction
21:12 um there were there were focuses of the
21:15 same effort
21:16 um and what it was you had portions of
21:19 awesome which of course
21:21 now know bigelow aerospace was part of
21:23 uh had some incredible scientists
21:25 working at uh
21:26 at the at the ranch facility and by the
21:28 way other places it wasn't just the
21:29 ranch
21:30 uh and just to jump in just to clarify
21:33 you're talking about skinwalker ranch
21:35 okay so so you're and this is another
21:38 one but since you brought it up i'll
21:39 just ask it really quick
21:41 so so a tip or awesapp or both
21:44 operated on the grounds of skinwalker
21:47 ranch in utah
21:50 uh i want to be careful i don't want to
21:51 answer for bob bigelow
21:53 or the former director of the program
21:55 because those are probably
21:57 nuances you'd have to ask them okay i
21:59 will say that it
22:00 involved uh the ranch um asap was that
22:03 it was looking at
22:05 looking at the phenomenon through um
22:08 through a very broad lens um and uh
22:12 you know that's that's what they were
22:13 doing okay um and by the way there was
22:15 some pretty compelling data i mean
22:17 i'll share with you that it was there
22:18 was some very compelling data
22:21 um some of it was was a little bit
22:22 disturbing to be honest with you
22:25 but uh in 2009 a
22:28 the decision was really made to formally
22:31 if you will um partition off
22:35 that that part of the study involving
22:38 the uap phenomena
22:40 under atip and the reason why is because
22:42 we were getting data from all different
22:44 sensor platforms
22:46 that weren't necessarily ranch related
22:48 these were you know of course everybody
22:49 now knows nimitz and all these other
22:51 other cases um but you know you had
22:54 you know strategic carrier groups out in
22:56 in
22:57 in certain aors um
23:00 areas of operation if you will where
23:03 where we were picking up uap activity
23:05 and so we realized that there was a
23:07 really a
23:08 concerted need to to focus
23:12 on the topic of uaps uh from a nuts and
23:15 bolts perspective now
23:17 let me caveat a lot of people when i say
23:19 that they kind of retract and say yeah
23:21 but you can't look at these from a nuts
23:22 and bolts
23:22 perspective you have to you know look at
23:24 this from this perspective in that
23:25 perspective
23:26 and you know what they could be
23:27 absolutely right but in the department
23:30 of defense we
23:31 we had to be able to to do two things
23:33 and to qualify and quantify
23:36 data otherwise for us it was useless i'm
23:39 not saying it is useless i'm saying
23:41 for our purposes in department of
23:42 defense briefing senior leadership
23:44 that unless i can qualify and quantify
23:47 data
23:48 it's it's conjecture there's there's no
23:51 there there i can't do anything with it
23:53 so
23:53 um and there was enough sufficient data
23:56 coming in where we could
23:57 i mean we could say there were these
23:58 many incidents occurring in this
23:59 particular month and these particular
24:01 parts of the waters
24:02 with these particular assets um you know
24:04 these are the
24:05 videos pictures that were taken and
24:07 radar information
24:08 so it it helps you paint a compelling
24:11 picture
24:12 to to leadership um
24:15 of of of an event that is occurring or
24:18 events that are occurring
24:19 and so that decision really started to
24:21 occur started to solidify in 2009 and
24:24 that's why you see i think in the in
24:26 senator reid's now
24:27 now in this letter that came out
24:29 everybody's now knows about
24:31 all the way back in 2009 to then deputy
24:33 secretary lynn
24:34 um that he wanted to take this portion
24:37 of
24:37 a tip that you actually see the advanced
24:39 aerospace threat interference program
24:41 become a formalized
24:42 effort and and put that into into sap
24:44 channels
24:45 to protect it uh because we knew based
24:48 upon the efforts that were going on with
24:49 osap
24:51 that you had two camps you had some
24:53 people that really supported the effort
24:55 and then you had some people that really
24:56 didn't support the effort and by the way
24:58 this isn't just with awsap
24:59 we saw this before with how puddles
25:01 program was stargate and the remote
25:02 viewing program that
25:04 you know anytime the government was
25:06 dealing with something that was
25:08 um maybe maybe a bit unconventional
25:12 fringe
25:13 it would tend to if considered by some
25:16 fringe
25:17 it ruffled a lot of feathers and so um
25:19 you know
25:20 i guess the solution then the mindset
25:22 was let's let's take this program that's
25:24 kind of exposed
25:25 and let's put it under this umbrella of
25:27 sap or we can protect it
25:29 uh and you know we can still continue to
25:31 collect information without fear of
25:33 of people on the outside not
25:35 understanding what we're doing and
25:36 having this knee-jerk reaction to i just
25:38 shut it down
25:39 so um that's that's kind of how that all
25:42 evolved
25:42 gotcha so then asap from what it sounds
25:45 like
25:46 was was completely different a tip was
25:48 branching off
25:50 on just uap investigations fair
25:53 to say that i mean from my perspective i
25:55 mean i'm i'm sure if you talk to people
25:57 that were in awesap
25:58 that were still doing stump stuff in the
26:00 a-tip side of the house and vice versa
26:02 they would probably tell you it was more
26:04 of a gray area there wasn't really a
26:06 heart in the early days in the end
26:08 there was but in the early days there
26:09 wasn't really a hard transition
26:11 or you if you will event an event
26:13 horizon yeah separating
26:15 the asap program and the a-tip it was
26:17 kind of a blurry line there
26:19 that sometimes shifted but by 2010 we
26:22 were firmly
26:23 by 2010 nine really but in 10 it was
26:26 there was no question about it
26:28 atip was its own focus area i want to
26:30 ask you about the
26:32 some of the public documentation the
26:33 verified information that has come
26:35 out uh and that is uh involving ossap
26:38 now i know that you didn't lead asap and
26:40 sometimes you don't like to talk about
26:41 it
26:42 but i do want to ask you something that
26:44 also encompasses
26:45 atip which is that public documentation
26:48 has
26:49 absolutely zero mention of paranormal
26:53 ufos uaps unidentified craft and so on
26:56 that rather it was a more of a
26:57 forward-looking
26:58 program at least that's what the public
27:01 bid solicitation
27:02 stated where i have a a very big
27:06 question
27:07 on this is that disconnect from what we
27:10 know
27:11 to then bask getting the contract it's a
27:14 uap study
27:15 uh and then that bores out uh atip and
27:18 voila we have the rest is
27:19 is history what what am i missing just
27:23 by
27:23 looking at that documentation so that's
27:25 a great question so
27:26 anytime you look at any governmental
27:28 solicitation we call this
27:30 contract solicitation this goes out to
27:32 the public sphere right
27:34 and that means anybody and everybody can
27:35 look at it to include russians because
27:37 the contract you're spending american
27:38 taxpayer dollars to do
27:40 job xyz so even when you want to build a
27:42 b-2 bomber
27:43 right in air force contracts you don't
27:45 put out a contract saying hey we want
27:47 somebody to come out and build a
27:48 super secret spell space stealth you
27:51 know
27:52 technology let me repeat that again
27:53 sorry about that even when you're doing
27:55 the b2 bomber and you want to do a
27:57 solicitation for someone to build you a
27:59 super secret stealth bomber right you
28:02 don't
28:03 you don't in the solicitation it will
28:05 never say that it will say
28:07 very nebulous ambiguous language because
28:10 you don't want to tip
28:11 off to your foreign adversaries key
28:13 technology that you're trying to develop
28:15 or build
28:16 so it's the same thing with this um when
28:19 when
28:19 the solicitation which by the way for
28:21 the record i wasn't part of
28:23 sure yeah but i can tell you from
28:24 general perspective how how
28:26 we do this um at the unclassified level
28:29 you're going to see these solicitations
28:31 always very generalized
28:33 um and that is specifically because you
28:35 don't want to tip your hand
28:37 unnecessarily
28:38 to your foreign adversaries that you're
28:40 working on project a b
28:42 c or d so that's why you see it i would
28:45 i would i would
28:46 challenge anybody in your audience to go
28:47 ahead and look at other solicitations
28:49 you know now we can look back and and
28:51 you know look back 10 15 years
28:53 look at some of those technologies back
28:55 then that we're really protecting
28:57 whether it's drone technology right
28:59 for to help us under global warm terror
29:02 those solicitations when you read those
29:04 unclassified solicitations
29:06 almost read nothing like the classified
29:08 portion of what the job really is you
29:10 you in fact when you look at it you're
29:11 going to see
29:12 you know i've read this solicitation six
29:14 times i still have no idea what it's for
29:15 so it's so ambiguous in general and let
29:17 me jump in there because
29:19 uh i get a lot of heat for bringing this
29:21 up and i don't think it's as bad
29:22 of an act quote-unquote accusation i'm
29:24 not accusing anybody but
29:26 i don't think it's as bad of a thing as
29:28 people make it
29:29 sound like when i pose this but if
29:31 there's a classified portion of a bid
29:33 solicitation right
29:35 and and you have that public setting and
29:37 then you have something behind the
29:38 scenes that
29:39 only cleared personnel can see when
29:42 contractors come in
29:43 i'm with you on all of that however
29:46 in kind of digging into that area where
29:48 i get myself into trouble from some
29:50 people
29:51 is that bigelow aerospace who obviously
29:54 has a
29:54 vested interest in this personal
29:56 interest has invested a lot of his own
29:58 money
29:59 away from atip and osap and all that
30:01 into the uap phenomena
30:03 if he's not right up front getting that
30:06 classified description
30:07 he sees the public part they bid on it
30:10 what are the odds that
30:11 that organization gets this contract to
30:15 secretly uh in a classified setting
30:18 investigate uaps
30:19 and according to the defense
30:20 intelligence agency he's the only one
30:23 out of every government contractee that
30:26 contractor that that could actually uh
30:29 bid on this
30:29 he's the only one and that leads to a
30:32 discussion about a sweetheart deal
30:34 i doubt you want to comment on that but
30:36 i bring it up just simply because
30:38 that's the disconnect that i still don't
30:40 understand because
30:42 he can't grab that classified portion of
30:44 the solicitation
30:45 or correct me if i'm wrong before he
30:48 gets granted
30:49 the contract right well i i i i can't
30:52 comment on it because i wasn't there but
30:54 i can comment on it from the perspective
30:56 a couple things so first of all i i do
30:58 know
30:59 mr bigelow personally he's an amazing
31:01 human being um
31:02 anybody who who's never had the chance
31:04 to meet this guy
31:06 he he really is an american hero uh he
31:08 has
31:09 he has contributed more to this topic
31:12 behind the scenes i think than than just
31:14 about anybody
31:15 um certainly even more certainly more
31:17 than i have so
31:18 um that's the first thing second of all
31:21 i think if you look at aerospace
31:23 in general look at lockheed martin look
31:25 at boeing look at northrop grumman and
31:27 all these others
31:28 you know there's only certain companies
31:30 that can build an f-22 31:33 right and at the end of the day it's up
31:34 to two companies i think you had
31:36 lockheed and then you had you know the
31:38 other guys that they wind up
31:39 going with um you know a lot of times
31:43 there are contracts where you might tell
31:45 somebody ahead of time
31:46 look we're going to write this contract
31:50 you're probably the only company that
31:51 can do it
31:53 um so just be advised that this contract
31:56 may be coming out at some point
31:58 because there's only certain amount of
32:00 certain certain companies that can do
32:02 certain things you wouldn't expect for
32:04 example
32:05 um look at the early days when we had g
32:08 i'm a jeep guy right so i love old war
32:10 jeeps korean war world war ii jeeps
32:13 a lot of people don't realize people
32:14 look at a jeep and say oh that was you
32:15 know that was a
32:18 jeep product but there were a lot of
32:19 companies that were making jeeps in the
32:21 early days of world war ii you had ford
32:22 making um
32:23 and then you had of course uh you know
32:25 the overlay and jeep overlaying company
32:26 and you had some other organization that
32:28 were bidding for a contract
32:29 and at the end of the day it turned out
32:31 to be only only two companies from my
32:32 understanding that actually got the g
32:34 contract uh and then later i want to be
32:36 just one believe it or not
32:37 um so it's it's a bit convoluted
32:41 the way that contracting world works
32:45 it's not perfect but at the same time i
32:48 think there's enough oversight now when
32:49 you look at how
32:51 how contracts are selected they're not
32:53 selected by anybody
32:55 who's connected really to the contract
32:56 or connected by an outside
32:58 independent organization and there's a
33:00 reason for that because you have to be
33:02 fair and unbiased
33:03 now i don't know this to be true but
33:06 i've been told that
33:07 apparently bigelow was the only one
33:09 bigger local
33:10 bass was the only one to actually bid
33:13 for the contract
33:14 so you know naturally if you only have
33:16 one bidder and they have the
33:17 qualifications they're probably gonna
33:19 get the contract
33:20 um but i i unfortunately like i said
33:23 that
33:23 occurred before my time sure i came in
33:26 really in 2008 33:27 that that ship had sailed back in 2007 33:30 um so i i i truly honestly can't tell
33:34 you exactly how it went down
33:35 only because i wasn't there for it i got
33:37 you fair enough
33:39 during the a-tip days i want to talk a
33:41 little bit about the the controversy
33:43 we're about halfway through the
33:44 interview and i want to make sure that i
33:45 give you ample time to address some of
33:47 this
33:48 and that is the government's reaction to
33:50 you coming out you resign
33:52 uh you come out you uh become a part of
33:56 to the stars academy
33:57 you bring videos along with you i'm
34:00 gonna combine
34:01 like 700 of the questions that i have
34:03 here
34:04 for for for time reasons but i i want to
34:07 talk about that controversy
34:09 let me ask first quickly if i may at
34:12 what point you were you resigned october
34:14 4 2017 if i remember correctly uh
34:17 you had submitted your your resignation
34:19 letter at what point did you meet
34:22 tom delong and plan to join to the stars
34:25 academy and bring
34:26 all of this information to light yeah i
34:29 i had made a decision to leave actually
34:31 i'd spoke with
34:33 my my dear colleague and friend chris
34:35 mellon and it was
34:36 you know it was a soul-searching moment
34:37 for me and uh
34:40 finally i made the decision i said look
34:42 you know i i i can't fix this
34:45 on the inside i i can't this is a guy
34:47 this is
34:48 secretary mattis is a guy that i had
34:50 been been in combat with served with
34:52 and and just an amazing human being uh
34:55 and
34:55 and you know the bureaucracy
34:57 unfortunately was such
35:00 it just wasn't getting the information
35:02 to the right people and so
35:04 sometimes you know in a situation like
35:06 that
35:07 you do what you have to do and in order
35:10 to
35:11 to fix the problem i i i felt that i had
35:14 to i had to leave the organization
35:16 because i knew they wouldn't be able to
35:17 stop the one thing they couldn't stop
35:18 would be my resignation memo and
35:19 by the way let's let's not forget that
35:22 almost a year later
35:23 to the day secretary mattis did the same
35:25 thing he resigned right
35:26 so rather than cause problems inside the
35:29 system
35:30 in the department of defense you know if
35:32 if you can't solve it you need to get
35:34 out of the way
35:34 and you don't don't stay in a system
35:36 that you don't don't agree with if it's
35:38 if it's really problematic
35:40 then resign so the organization
35:44 organization can continue doing what
35:45 it's supposed to do and you don't become
35:48 uh if you will um a friction point um
35:50 that's just kind of a
35:52 code of honor we have uh in in the
35:54 department
35:55 it's it's common you see it in all the
35:56 services it's just what happens
35:59 as far as meeting tom belong it was
36:01 until afterwards actually once i
36:03 resigned is when
36:04 um i was approached to say hey lou you
36:07 know there's this little organization
36:09 over here
36:10 led by some guy some some rock star
36:12 which
36:13 for the record when you're when you're a
36:14 guy like me used to living in the
36:16 shadows
36:17 that's the last thing you want to do is
36:18 ever be in any kind of spotlight sure
36:20 it's just it's not our character it's
36:21 not the way we operate
36:23 uh but what i realized that it was hal
36:26 and steve justice
36:27 and chris mallet and jim semivan on
36:29 board
36:30 whoa now those are people i do know now
36:32 don't get me wrong tom's a great guy but
36:34 but i never knew the guy you know from
36:36 adam being in the intelligence community
36:38 you know i might been able to pick out a
36:40 song
36:41 but had no idea who who this guy was and
36:44 really didn't pay attention to it
36:46 but when i saw who else was on and you
36:49 had the advisors like dr norm khan
36:52 and some of these other really big names
36:54 that i had a chance to work with while i
36:56 was in the intelligence community
36:58 whoa now that's that's significant this
37:01 guy may be
37:02 a punk rocker but he managed to get
37:04 these folks together
37:06 in the same room and support this cause
37:09 you know that's that's that's a hell of
37:12 an accomplishment you know and so i was
37:14 like
37:15 wow that's that's really hard to say
37:18 no to um especially when you have those
37:22 people on board
37:23 um that and there was a lot more people
37:25 that were affiliated with ttsa
37:27 that's not publicly known but again some
37:30 some pretty significant people who had
37:32 the honor and pleasure to serve with
37:33 back in my day in the military
37:35 department of defense and later on in
37:37 in the intelligence community so that
37:39 was really for me
37:40 i i had a conversation with my wife and
37:42 said look you know
37:44 what do you think and you know she says
37:45 well you you know these people
37:47 and you know do you trust them and the
37:48 answers you know emphatically yes i do
37:51 trust them with my life um so that was
37:54 kind of an easy decision for me
37:56 so you had known christopher mellon
37:58 prior to resigning uh it sounds like you
37:59 had a conversation with him but did not
38:01 did not know anyone else uh when it came
38:04 to to the stars academy until after you
38:06 resigned
38:07 and it was it seems like no i knew how
38:09 pluto i i knew oh
38:12 sure he was part yeah and i'm sorry uh
38:14 backtrack
38:15 did then did you know did he tell you
38:17 about to the stars
38:19 before you i think it was jim semivan
38:22 who
38:22 who i who actually said hey why don't
38:24 you consider
38:25 jumping on board with us if i remember
38:28 don't hold me to it but i mean we're
38:29 going back
38:30 three years now i'm pretty certain it
38:32 was
38:33 jim who who actually was the one to
38:35 offer me
38:36 uh a position uh pre-resignation or
38:39 or post just for chronological post post
38:42 post gotcha
38:43 i got you so you yeah cause i think they
38:45 knew that i was going to wind up working
38:46 at
38:47 you know i got to be careful though i
38:49 want to put a plug in first
38:50 i was going to wind up working you know
38:52 at a
38:53 probably a supermarket uh just to uh
38:56 just to pay my bills afterwards because
38:58 you know even though i had left the
38:59 department i
39:01 i'm not the age of retirement yet i
39:03 can't collect my pension
39:05 so you know i still i still needed
39:07 employment gotcha
39:08 okay so you joined to the stars academy
39:11 it all seems to happen pretty
39:12 quick after you had resigned because a
39:14 couple weeks go by and you're
39:16 on screen it was very fast yeah it was
39:18 very fast sounds like it
39:19 so and you you brought with you a couple
39:21 videos i want to focus in on that now
39:23 and and then we'll we'll get more to the
39:25 the dod's read but just to be clear i
39:27 didn't actually bring
39:28 those videos i wasn't me i did not i
39:30 facilitated the process of getting them
39:33 releasable through department of defense
39:35 channels but i didn't actually bring
39:37 them
39:37 that was somebody else okay so you had
39:40 filed the paperwork obviously that
39:42 yes okay i did and by the way with after
39:45 having a
39:46 long discussion with my team because i
39:48 was a senior guy i'm the one who had to
39:50 request it
39:51 but it was a mutual decision that we
39:53 would go
39:54 so the initial intent john was to have a
39:57 unclassified repository because that was
39:59 my experience before when i was working
40:01 department defense was really setting up
40:02 these special enclaves
40:04 where you could share very sensitive
40:05 national level intelligence
40:07 via what we call a terror line and
40:09 getting that information
40:11 down to a level could be consumable by
40:14 by
40:14 anybody out there that's you know local
40:16 law enforcement state authorities
40:18 anybody like that um that's that's
40:20 actionable information but it was super
40:22 classified so
40:23 you have to come up with a mechanism
40:25 where people who don't necessarily have
40:26 security clearance
40:27 can access really really classified
40:28 information so there's a mechanism to do
40:31 that so
40:32 that kind of was my 4k for some time so
40:34 we wanted to build an unclassified
40:36 repository where
40:38 information could be put on that was
40:42 not super uber sensitive there wasn't
40:44 any like classified metadata
40:46 or call signs or locational information
40:50 but we could create this database that
40:52 allowed other people from the outside to
40:54 look at this and say oh
40:55 uh because we we didn't we really we
40:58 went through analysis after analysis and
41:00 we were still coming up with the goose
41:01 egg we had
41:02 no idea what the hell these things were
41:04 we were hoping that maybe some other
41:05 people say yeah you know what we picked
41:07 that up too and
41:08 and maybe some some
41:11 state authorities in you know kansas
41:13 said yeah actually we've been seeing
41:14 these things over
41:16 our nuclear facilities or i'm just as an
41:18 example right i'm not saying just
41:20 changes in nuclear facilities sure i got
41:21 you giving it an example a lot of people
41:23 are going to read into that and going
41:24 kansas nuclear
41:25 what's going on right right that's what
41:26 i'm saying it's anecdotal
41:29 there's going to be blogs about this in
41:30 about an hour so
41:34 i know god i promise you i don't really
41:36 mean candy yeah i'm not saying it for
41:38 the
41:38 conversation um but my point being is
41:41 that
41:42 uh we were trying to create a an enclave
41:44 that allowed us to share this
41:46 information that came from us government
41:49 sources
41:50 to a broader audience in industry uh the
41:53 you know
41:54 the big boys boeings of the world and
41:56 the raytheons and
41:57 try to get more people into the
41:58 conversation because we really
42:01 had no idea what we were dealing with
42:03 and and even the folks that we're
42:05 working with in other agencies were
42:06 scratching your head
42:07 i mean to the point where i remember one
42:09 meeting john we
42:11 we we did such mental gymnastics trying
42:14 to come up with there was one particular
42:16 video i won't go into detail but
42:18 it was so so incredible that we were
42:21 doing these mental gymnastics trying to
42:23 come up with a what if scenario
42:26 what technology would this have to be to
42:28 be able to do this
42:29 yeah and it was one of being so
42:31 preposterous so
42:32 so ridiculously over the top we all just
42:36 kind of looked at ourselves and said all
42:37 right that's
42:38 there's no way that that was you know
42:41 that could be what it is
42:42 um so that was again a long probably a
42:46 much
42:46 longer winded response that you were
42:48 looking for but that no no you mentioned
42:49 a video
42:50 lou uh can you tell me what video that
42:52 was
42:55 uh the ones that we got released yes so
42:58 it was no no the ones that you came up
43:01 with the explanation not to
43:02 step on you oh no unfortunately
43:05 i cannot well i knew i'd get letters if
43:08 i didn't try i'm no longer in the u.s
43:10 government
43:13 i have to be careful those those you
43:15 know um i i want to be
43:17 be very clear that um
43:20 you know the it's us government's
43:22 business to determine
43:23 what is releasable or not not mine okay
43:26 um i gotcha
43:27 and uh anything that i may have been
43:29 been exposed to back in at
43:31 i really until the government just gives
43:34 the green light i just i just can't i
43:36 just had to push you on that one
43:37 you mentioned that i had to i had to go
43:40 so let me ask you
43:41 one of the few sensitive questions that
43:43 that i talked about in the beginning
43:44 and that is the paperwork that came out
43:46 through foia i went after
43:48 those documents as you know uh we've
43:50 talked about this privately but
43:51 i went after those documents for those
43:53 listening and watching that aren't aware
43:54 and and
43:55 found the emails that you were sharing
43:57 back and forth uh
43:58 with what is called dobser and that is
44:00 the arm that essentially will authorize
44:02 either public use or uh essentially them
44:05 declassifying something or something's
44:07 unclassified and clearing it for release
44:09 and so on just kind of quickly summarize
44:11 it those documents come out in
44:13 in the form uh that had already leaked
44:15 in part had come out
44:17 but that was kind of re-verified on an
44:19 official level
44:21 and the way you would describe the
44:23 videos
44:24 uh is what it what really kind of
44:26 intrigues me in a way
44:28 that is a big fat question mark and that
44:32 is that you describe the flare the
44:33 gimbal and the go fast
44:35 as balloons drones and uas's
44:39 and what kind of confuses me about that
44:42 is dobster is cleared at the top secret
44:45 level so they've got the you know jaywix
44:47 protocols to send them
44:49 to let's say top secret data and they
44:51 review it they can say nope you can't
44:53 use this whatsoever
44:54 but they have those channels i've heard
44:57 but i want to ask from you because i
44:59 don't think i've ever asked you
45:00 this part before i've only heard from
45:03 others through you know third hand
45:04 info that you felt that you couldn't
45:08 inform them properly but
45:11 again i want to ask you this why were
45:14 the videos described
45:16 in that way if they would be cleared at
45:17 the top secret level
45:20 sure so if you look at the way dobster
45:22 works you're actually supposed to do the
45:24 requests at the unclassified level
45:26 so there's several dod instructions and
45:28 direct actually
45:29 instructions uh and manuals and then
45:32 there's some some brochures on
45:33 how you're supposed to request something
45:36 for publication
45:37 meaning that can be disseminated out and
45:40 that is through
45:41 an unclassified document 1910 45:44 and when you ask dobster they say please
45:46 send it to us unclassified level so
45:49 we had just gotten over the the this
45:51 awful situation with wikileaks where we
45:54 knew foreign adversaries were hacking
45:56 our systems that's a fact that's
45:58 that's that's not conjecture and and the
46:00 us government acknowledged that
46:02 and then of course you had insider
46:04 threats where you had
46:05 uh look i don't want to get political
46:07 here but there's you know
46:08 whether you're for or against but folks
46:10 like like private manning
46:12 uh that that took some very sensitive
46:14 information and released in an
46:15 unauthorized manner so
46:17 because we were dealing with something
46:18 that was so sensitive and there was so
46:20 few people that were read onto the
46:22 program and i couldn't even brief
46:24 my boss at the time about this this
46:26 program
46:27 i couldn't very well brief dobson who's
46:30 two and three degrees removed from my
46:34 own chain of command
46:35 and mentioned the word ufo so
46:38 the uas uh we had
46:42 coined for unidentified aerial systems
46:44 some say
46:45 unmanned aerial systems but literally
46:48 a uas is an unmanned or
46:51 uh uh system that's not
46:54 manned by a human being so that's that's
46:57 actually a
46:58 a legitimate term that we could use
47:01 without saying
47:02 ufo or uap knowing that the oca
47:06 the original classification authority
47:07 who dobson would have to go back to
47:09 anyways
47:09 right to get the approval was right onto
47:12 the program
47:13 and knew exactly what this was about so
47:15 so
47:16 um you know a lot of people say well was
47:18 that disingenuous we're trying to
47:19 mislead no no no everybody was about
47:20 everybody knew what we were talking
47:22 about
47:22 but it was a way that we could protect
47:24 this from having some sort of what we
47:25 call an
47:26 inadvertent disclosure this information
47:28 getting out
47:29 to somebody who wasn't read on and all
47:32 of a sudden now
47:33 the whole department is aware of what's
47:34 going on so that's
47:36 that's how that's how that if you will
47:40 that process
47:41 gotcha occur okay so one of the other
47:43 things on the the same form
47:45 was your intended use now for those just
47:48 tuning in or maybe missed the part
47:49 uh earlier in the show you had said you
47:51 did not bring these videos out somebody
47:54 else did
47:54 so i want to make sure that i repeat
47:56 that but internally the paperwork showed
47:58 that you only intended this for
48:00 internal government use only not
48:02 interrupted
48:03 initially correct initially that's what
48:05 we were we wanted to create a
48:08 an internal enclave unclassified so you
48:11 know the public
48:13 could we put industry partners because
48:15 that's broad enough where
48:16 if you're working with the united states
48:18 government in any type of capacity
48:20 you could be labeled as a type of
48:21 industry partner so whether you're
48:24 local law enforcement or your faa
48:27 or you're one of the services or you
48:30 know
48:31 whoever if you're working some sort of
48:32 kind of official capacity
48:34 we wanted to get people who had a had
48:36 certain expertise
48:37 open the aperture so we could get more
48:39 scientists more people to look at this
48:41 data and help us try to figure it out
48:43 and that was what you
48:44 internally called the community of
48:46 interest right
48:47 or coi which which is what yes yeah i've
48:50 always once those emails kind of
48:51 revealed themselves through
48:53 foia i was always intrigued by that
48:54 because that sounds like wow why didn't
48:56 they do this prior so
48:58 you know i've as an outsider yeah one
49:00 would think
49:01 right so so that uh and by the way i've
49:03 gone after i think i may have told you
49:04 privately but
49:05 trying to find more information if any
49:07 is there that they take that idea
49:09 because
49:10 from what i've seen when you look at
49:11 these types there's a lot more info
49:13 john well that's plugging away
49:15 absolutely right that's what i'm
49:16 that's what i'm going for so so but very
49:19 admirable intention there but again i
49:21 just wanted to ask
49:23 according to the dod anyway
49:26 that those videos had to adhere to what
49:29 was on that
49:29 what they call the dd form 1910 which we
49:31 didn't label it yet
49:33 but the dd form 1910 was again for that
49:36 that
49:36 private u.s government use only and
49:40 when christopher mellon had come out
49:41 recently he had said that he supplied
49:44 those videos to the new york times then
49:46 in the james fox's great documentary
49:48 getting rave reviews
49:50 around the world james i've known for a
49:52 very long time
49:53 so quick shout out to him make sure you
49:55 watch his new documentary
49:56 yeah he did a fantastic job he really
49:58 did yeah he's he's a he's a great human
50:00 being i know how much blood sweat and
50:01 tears went into that just from
50:02 knowing him personally so my kudos to
50:04 him uh but in that christopher mellon
50:06 came out and said somebody
50:08 didn't name them but somebody bent the
50:10 rules that was
50:12 what his wording was which i want to
50:16 juxtapose that with
50:17 how we were shown the videos from to the
50:19 stars academy
50:20 i don't expect you to speak for to the
50:22 stars i'm not asking you to
50:24 but i do want to ask about what they
50:26 called the chain of custody because
50:28 that's another one of those disconnects
50:30 where paperwork says internal use only
50:33 cleared for that then we see the videos
50:35 and it
50:36 they were kind of advertised at well not
50:38 kind of they were advertised as
50:40 going through the declassification
50:42 process through dod
50:44 and uh they had chain of custody
50:48 documentation and that has always
50:51 confused me
50:51 because that for me anyway i found the
50:54 dod chain of custody forms and stuff
50:56 like that
50:57 it just wouldn't apply is that accurate
51:00 so what is that change of custody you
51:02 know i can't speak for chris mellon and
51:04 quite frankly i've never asked chris i
51:06 don't want to know
51:07 uh you know there's i hate to say
51:09 plausible deniability is sometimes a
51:11 good thing
51:12 um but out of respect for chris i i've
51:14 never asked him
51:16 this source and i don't really plan to
51:18 to be honest with you that's between
51:20 chris and and
51:21 whoever he talked to um
51:24 you know the how ttsa
51:28 wound up putting them forward um
51:32 i will tell you if you were to ask me
51:35 you know i
51:36 i probably would have been more hesitant
51:38 to do that but you know
51:40 it happened uh and it happened without
51:42 me knowing
51:44 um that really was so you had no idea
51:46 that they that they were gonna release
51:47 those videos
51:50 uh not until the uh new york times
51:53 article
51:54 yeah that was not um i i was not a
51:58 i was not aware um
52:01 yeah were you aware they had them if i
52:04 can ask that
52:10 no actually um let me think
52:17 john i i don't recall i i really don't i
52:19 don't think because i remember being
52:20 very surprised
52:22 uh because the intent originally was for
52:25 a
52:26 community of interest and unclassified
52:28 but for official use only if you will
52:30 community of interest and i
52:34 i didn't i wasn't the one who who
52:36 provided them so
52:37 i really don't know what ttsa was
52:40 thinking you probably want to talk to
52:41 them as you know i no longer
52:45 publicly affiliated with with ttsa
52:47 they're they're great people
52:48 tom's a great guy you know we can still
52:50 talk uh
52:52 but um i i can't speak for ttx i got you
52:54 no i and i understand that
52:56 and respect that and and i want to
52:58 actually ask you about that but i do
52:59 want to make sure i have enough time to
53:01 ask you
53:02 this uh kind of round of questions which
53:05 is
53:05 the dod's reaction to all of this that
53:08 after you resigned
53:09 after these videos came out in the way
53:11 that you did which you've already
53:12 outlined obviously internally
53:15 this created kind of a riff we can see
53:18 oh yeah
53:19 oh hey listen life was very
53:21 uncomfortable for lou elizondo for a
53:23 long time
53:24 i i would imagine it was well first of
53:27 all you had the problem
53:28 most people didn't know the program was
53:29 real so they thought lou went you know
53:32 deep six he went blue went crazy uh
53:35 and then as it started to unfold
53:38 internally they're like oh
53:40 crap this program was real and you know
53:43 we never got briefed on it because lou
53:44 was going to the
53:46 much higher levels with this program
53:48 then it they got
53:50 some some people in there well two camps
53:52 one said oh
53:53 wow you know what yeah uh we better we
53:56 better
53:57 um not treat lou so harshly because he
53:59 had
54:00 very very senior people in the loop he
54:02 was actually doing his job
54:03 then you had another faction of people
54:04 saying well he still should have told me
54:06 so let's burn him to the ground
54:08 let's launch an investigation let's uh
54:10 pull his security clearance
54:12 and uh let's you know let's do
54:14 everything we can to
54:15 to uh blow up his credibility and um
54:18 there are still some pockets of those
54:20 that are those individuals that exist
54:22 i think that's probably why you see you
54:25 know despite the senator and all these
54:26 people coming out saying yeah it was
54:28 real
54:28 and yeah was the guy running it and all
54:31 these
54:32 obvious things that people look back and
54:33 say well that's obvious back then
54:35 it wasn't yeah um and there were people
54:38 there were factions in the in the dod
54:40 that were not very happy with me
54:41 and those are the same factions that are
54:43 still influencing some of your foia
54:45 process
54:46 where you know something exists but they
54:48 come back saying man nothing to see here
54:50 yeah and you might have to try three or
54:52 four times before you finally get
54:53 something and you're like
54:55 you know what the heck how come now i'm
54:57 only i'm only getting this when i've
54:59 requested it you know
55:00 two years ago yeah um they're in a tough
55:02 spot and i don't want to disparage the
55:04 dod because i do think
55:07 i don't think we can hold accountable a
55:09 few people there
55:11 for for that dysfunction and blame the
55:14 entire department because
55:15 because the department of defense is
55:16 very very good at what it does
55:19 the acting secretary right now is a
55:21 fantastic human being the guy is a
55:24 national hero
55:25 i won't go into details because he may
55:26 be watching this but but the guy was
55:28 there in the early days of afghanistan
55:30 i mean super super cheap person
55:34 uh and and that is representative of the
55:37 most of the department of defense
55:39 they're good people that want to do a
55:40 good job for the american people
55:43 the problem is you get some bureaucrats
55:46 in there and people that are
55:48 are political and you know there
55:52 there becomes an issue about ego and
55:54 just because i wasn't told about
55:56 something therefore it must not exist
55:58 well
55:59 that's not necessarily so and it wasn't
56:01 up to me to tell because
56:03 when you look at that 2009 memo from the
56:05 senate
56:06 the the the access list to that program
56:09 was
56:09 super super small i i can't just go out
56:12 and brief somebody
56:13 because i know the authority to do that
56:15 i get in trouble so um
56:17 that created a lot of uh a lot of
56:19 challenges for me
56:20 and you know i i often tell people say
56:22 well lou why did you just back then say
56:24 a b and c
56:26 well because i made a promise to certain
56:28 people and i wasn't going to
56:30 to violate that trust i knew damn well
56:33 getting into this
56:34 that this was going to be an uphill
56:36 battle i had probably a 5 56:38 chance of mission success which isn't
56:40 very good those are not good odds don't
56:42 go to vegas with those odds
56:44 um but i had a heart to heart with my
56:46 team members and we
56:47 in order for this for this topic to
56:50 to finally get the light that it
56:53 deserved
56:56 someone had to step out and that someone
56:58 i being a military guy
57:00 it had to be me i was a senior guy so
57:03 and and let me ask you just focusing in
57:06 on on the dod
57:07 what i call they they took a shot at you
57:09 and i apologize if that phrasing is not
57:11 appropriate
57:12 um but essentially you know they they
57:14 took a shot at your credibility
57:16 uh and and they're challenging you as a
57:18 person as a dedicated
57:21 military uh then later civilian employee
57:24 of the department of defense they are by
57:26 name
57:27 taking uh this credibility shot
57:31 at you and i will admit when that story
57:34 broke
57:34 i was surprised despite my again that
57:38 that criticism
57:39 uh which you have not shied away from
57:42 that you've always spoken to me about
57:43 and i want to point out again
57:45 for those who missed it in the beginning
57:46 how admirable that is to you because
57:48 you're not afraid of these questions
57:50 uh nor were you privately when we
57:52 chatted on the phone or through email
57:54 but when they did that i just kind of
57:57 like took a step back and i'm like okay
57:59 i'm not this isn't about luis elizondo
58:01 for me
58:02 this is about what is the truth behind
58:04 what i believe is this active ufo
58:06 cover-up
58:07 after they did that let's zero in on the
58:10 spokespeople because they did that we
58:12 don't have to name names or make
58:13 accusations but
58:14 sure sure you know the spokespeople did
58:16 this and they took that essential shot
58:19 why why don't you take a shot back
58:23 and just say look here is the
58:26 irrefutable proof and let me just
58:27 quickly preface
58:29 why i'm asking that is that i've seen
58:31 that there
58:32 are a very and this is post posted
58:34 publicly
58:35 a small list of people that include a
58:37 couple journalists and
58:39 one ufo what i would call like a ufo
58:41 blogger
58:42 in particular that have made reference
58:45 to you
58:46 showing them documentation what they
58:48 call irrefutable
58:50 proof that you are who you say you are
58:52 now i'm not challenging that i believe
58:54 that they saw something
58:56 uh let me just quickly ask yes or no is
58:59 that classified information
59:01 it's not classified no but understand
59:03 that i'm not going to
59:05 give up the identities of other
59:07 individuals just to save my skin i've
59:09 never been sure
59:10 i'm not that guy what i could have i
59:12 could have settled this
59:13 three years ago and you know there when
59:16 you talk to
59:17 senator reid himself that's for the
59:20 record
59:20 he's telling you yeah lou was the guy
59:22 running the program when you talked to
59:23 hal pudov who was working for me
59:25 who's clearly part of at yeah i worked
59:27 for lou i mean these are
59:29 i don't need to go toe-to-toe and get
59:31 into a mud-slinging contest
59:33 with the pentagon when they've already
59:34 flip-flopped on their position six times
59:36 first they came out and said yeah a-tip
59:38 was real is about ufos and lou ran it
59:40 then they came back and said well no
59:41 a-chip uh wasn't about ufos then they
59:43 said well atyp wasn't about ufos but who
59:45 didn't run it i mean it's
59:47 if if you look at the track record and i
59:48 know i know we you know you've seen this
59:50 over and over again
59:51 sure you know my position has been
59:54 consistent and i've been backed up
59:56 by by everybody that needs to back me up
59:58 this isn't about louis lozano it's not
60:00 about me if i make it about lou elizondo
60:02 then we take away from the progress
60:04 we've made look how far we've come
60:05 in three years in just three years
60:09 john we have now the videos coming out
60:12 that were
60:12 official government videos never before
60:14 released the acknowledgement that
60:16 they're real the acknowledgement that
60:17 they are some sort of unidentified
60:19 aerial phenomena
60:20 the establishment of a uap task force
60:22 congress being briefed at the classified
60:24 levels
60:24 by the way if you don't think i was part
60:26 of that program how the hell do you
60:28 think i ever made it on the hill
60:29 to brief people i mean it's it's at this
60:32 point it's kind of silly i know and i
60:33 don't need to rehash all this because
60:36 we could go for half an hour laundry
60:37 list of laundry lists
60:39 the bottom line john it's not about me i
60:41 don't really care what people think
60:42 about me
60:42 never have never will this is about this
60:45 is about
60:47 this this incredible movement
60:51 for for transparency and and
60:54 real meaningful disclosure yeah i mean
60:57 that's what's more important me going up
60:58 and saying hey look at me and i'm you
61:00 know going to go ahead and
61:02 and make the government look silly no
61:04 because we still need to work with the
61:05 government if i did that
61:06 then we run the chance of just to just
61:09 so i can go ahead and
61:11 quote unquote prove who i am which i
61:13 don't need to prove anybody don't really
61:14 give a damn with you sure yeah
61:16 just to prove that i risk now putting my
61:18 guys that are still there in the program
61:21 where now all of a sudden it's it gets
61:24 shut down because it becomes too hot of
61:25 a topic yeah now the pentagon's getting
61:27 sued by louis lozando now this
61:29 defamation character now there's this
61:30 nobody wants to touch that hot potato
61:33 nobody does
61:34 so and by the way to come out and say
61:36 here's document one two three four
61:38 five it's not classified but it's it's
61:40 legit of what it is
61:42 with there's people on those emails that
61:44 are still engaged in those efforts
61:46 and i can't compromise them i won't do
61:48 it i never have i never will
61:50 so until those people come out which at
61:52 some point i'm sure they will
61:54 then people come on this document saying
61:56 oh wow look at that that isn't that
61:57 interesting
61:58 but until that occurs i'm not i'm i'm
62:00 not going to do it just to
62:02 to save face i'm not that guy never
62:04 never happened i'm not going to come out
62:06 there and say ah because
62:07 this isn't about lou it never has been
62:09 about lou and this is why i try to tell
62:11 people
62:11 you know people say well lose now the
62:13 face of of of these ufos i'm not the
62:16 face
62:17 look in the mirror you're the face it's
62:19 everybody out there in your audience
62:20 they're the face of this
62:22 i just happen to be one of the tools in
62:23 the tool bag like chris mellon and other
62:26 people
62:27 but this is this is a long game we are
62:30 you know i hate to say we're in a run
62:31 and gun battle here but
62:33 this is this is a long war not a short
62:35 war this isn't about instant
62:36 gratification
62:37 this isn't about you know lou going up
62:40 there and making the department of
62:41 defense look stupid
62:43 they've already have they've already put
62:44 themselves in that box i don't need to
62:46 help them with that
62:47 yeah you know in fact what they need is
62:48 a solution so they can
62:50 continue to tackle this problem without
62:52 people coming in and getting mad at it
62:54 because that's
62:54 that's really what they need and if i do
62:56 anything to
62:58 to poke the bear all it's going to do is
63:00 is make the situation worse when really
63:02 we're trying to help find a solution
63:04 i guess by the way if it's at my expense
63:06 i'll take it john i'm okay with it
63:07 if the cost of us getting this far in
63:10 three years
63:11 is people saying nah lose full of it you
63:13 know what
63:14 fine i'll i'll take it because enough
63:16 people know
63:17 exactly who i am and what i did and by
63:20 the way
63:20 this story is still unfolding it's just
63:23 not over
63:24 so there's a lot more to this narrative
63:26 that one comes out
63:27 people are going to go wow okay
63:30 that's interesting i had no idea what i
63:33 only have a couple
63:34 minutes left i again uh appreciate your
63:37 time
63:38 and i want to work this in if my
63:41 audience has heard me talk about these
63:43 types of issues
63:44 a lot passing it to you
63:47 if there's one thing that i haven't
63:49 covered but you want to talk about or
63:51 say or a message or anything what would
63:53 that be
63:59 you know boy
64:05 let me let me say this
64:09 i believe as dysfunctional as our our
64:13 family of of ufo enthusiasts
64:16 are whether it's ufo twitter or uap
64:20 research group etc etc
64:23 we have achieved this together and
64:27 yes even the naysayers even those
64:29 contrarians even those skeptics
64:32 we need you we need them all come on
64:35 board because this is
64:36 a conversation that affects all of us
64:39 and no one owns the narrative
64:41 i'm not out pushing a book i'm not i'm
64:43 just
64:44 anybody who wants to have a conversation
64:45 with me can have a conversation
64:47 we are achieving this together and that
64:50 is
64:50 the success here it's not that john
64:53 greenwald is doing the foyo or lou
64:55 elizondo's out there
64:56 doing tv shows or anybody else it's
64:59 everybody
65:00 doing what they do best in this sphere
65:02 that is creating
65:04 this moment in time that we have never
65:07 seen the likes before
65:09 we need it and it's okay i don't mind if
65:11 i have haters
65:12 that's okay if that's the cost of doing
65:14 business and that's the cost of doing
65:15 business
65:16 the truth has nothing to fear so i would
65:19 encourage people to
65:20 to know that that the second success we
65:23 are seeing
65:24 right now is a result of all of our
65:26 contributions
65:27 not just one person uh and and i think
65:31 everybody plays a vital role in this um
65:34 you know we would not be where we are
65:37 today john if you haven't done
65:38 and are doing the things you're doing
65:40 from your perspective that by the way
65:42 nobody's as good as doing it as you are
65:44 just like there are certain things that
65:45 i can do
65:46 um because of my access to
65:49 to help happen and chris mellon and and
65:52 yes even
65:52 everybody on out there in the in the uap
65:56 twitter world they're making a
65:58 difference they're they're campaigning
66:00 look at marco rubio when he just came
66:02 out and said not too long ago that's
66:03 because
66:04 people are telling him it's okay to have
66:05 this conversation we want to know
66:07 it's interesting right we're not going
66:09 to talk about elvis on the mother ship
66:11 anymore in tin foil hats
66:12 this is a serious topic that deserves
66:14 serious attention
66:16 and and whether you realize it or not
66:18 john people begin to look at you
66:20 and if you want to know what the face of
66:23 disclosure looks
66:24 like you're looking at it it's it's i'm
66:26 looking at it right now you're part of
66:28 that
66:28 people out there like uh you know
66:32 the the i got to be careful i don't want
66:33 to plug any particular people out there
66:35 but
66:35 there's a there's a huge sea
66:39 of of advocates out there in social
66:42 media
66:43 that are writing the congressman writing
66:45 the government they're do they're
66:46 learning from you
66:47 i mean how amazing is that right people
66:48 are now learning from john greenwald's
66:50 playbook and foia
66:51 and it's working i mean at some point
66:54 you know you can't stop the tidal wave
66:56 so
66:58 i would i guess my my final thought on
67:01 this would be
67:02 don't stop doing what you're doing you
67:05 know you don't have to be in anyone's
67:07 camp just keep doing what you're doing
67:09 and then i would also say
67:11 beware of those selling the snake oil
67:13 beware
67:14 of those who are telling you about these
67:16 preconceived narratives that they have
67:18 in their mind
67:19 and are saying no don't pay attention to
67:21 those guys that's the real threat when
67:23 someone tells you don't listen to that
67:25 person
67:26 that's the real threat i encourage you
67:28 you know what listen to anybody and
67:30 everybody you want to listen to and then
67:31 make up your own mind
67:32 that's my word of advice to anybody out
67:35 there who wants to know about this topic
67:37 and by the way no there is no expert out
67:39 there i don't care who you are or what
67:41 you say i was in it for 10 years working
67:43 for the us government
67:44 and i'm not an expert so that would be
67:47 my advice to people
67:48 and by the way when they say well lou
67:50 you're pushing the threat narrative no
67:51 i'm not
67:52 i'm pushing a narrative that they could
67:53 be a threat if they wanted to be because
67:54 we don't have enough information
67:56 that's what i've always maintained and
67:58 if you think it's fear-mongering well
67:59 then fine
68:00 i mean if you think you have some sort
68:02 of special relationship with the ufo and
68:04 you know you want to charge people money
68:06 so they can have a you know
68:08 close encounter you know while you're
68:10 paying pilots to drop flares okay fine i
68:13 don't know
68:13 you know do whatever you want i just i i
68:16 think
68:17 i think we need to i think we need to
68:19 have a a
68:21 conversation where everybody has a voice
68:24 and we stop trying to mute each other
68:27 i think that's the real danger those are
68:28 great words and by the way the threat
68:30 potential narrative i have agreed since
68:32 day one
68:33 with you guys that ttsa as a whole
68:36 obviously has dealt with that a lot
68:38 uh i've done foia requests upon foia
68:41 request on
68:42 that but that threat potential it's very
68:44 real i don't know why people are afraid
68:46 of the t
68:47 word i know i'm out of time if i could
68:49 ask you just one more
68:50 question yeah absolutely because i want
68:52 you to have the opportunity to respond
68:54 because this is all kind of unfolding
68:56 right now
68:56 as you mentioned you've decided to as
68:59 you put it
69:00 not be affiliated with ttsa although you
69:02 still
69:03 have high respect for them i've been
69:05 kind of waiting i've reached out to them
69:07 unrelated to this show but uh reached
69:09 out to them to get
69:10 like some type of you know response
69:13 press release are they
69:14 informing their investors only because i
69:16 know my listeners and watchers
69:18 want to be updated on that so can i ask
69:21 you just kind of a two
69:22 two-parter here uh is there a reason
69:26 why you've decided to not be affiliated
69:28 anymore and the second part which is the
69:30 most important to me
69:31 is where does that leave off on the
69:33 crada agreement
69:35 with uh the uh us army where you guys
69:38 are taking
69:39 uh pieces of uaps that you have
69:42 collected
69:43 uh over the last couple of years created
69:45 a legend we don't know if they're
69:48 actually
69:48 i just want to be fair yep let's let's
69:52 caveat that you know
69:53 we really don't know we want to just
69:55 make we're doing our due diligence we're
69:56 trying to find out gotcha and and thank
69:58 you for that
69:59 and so you've got these these alleged
70:01 pieces of uap that you're going to have
70:03 analyzed
70:04 through this army agreement you're
70:06 listed on there you're the main
70:08 contact i forget what the exact wording
70:09 was and the agreement's been a while
70:11 so that's my last question to you is why
70:13 did you choose to leave and where does
70:14 that
70:14 leave us with that agreement and was
70:17 there anything that transpired thus far
70:20 so i i again i people are going to get
70:23 mad at me for saying this i can't speak
70:24 for ttsa i can only speak for myself
70:27 what i have mentioned before is that
70:29 ttsa is a company
70:30 and they owe their investors um a
70:34 result right which is all good companies
70:36 should do
70:37 these stewards of investment um where my
70:40 expertise lies specifically me and luis
70:43 helicondo
70:44 is not necessarily in the entertainment
70:47 division
70:47 which is where ttsa does a lot of its
70:50 focus areas on
70:52 and for me my skill sets
70:56 are probably better used in a different
70:58 capacity
70:59 um so that decision was made um
71:03 my i have again all my friends at ttsa i
71:06 love them dearly
71:07 great people great human beings um
71:10 but um you know this is battlefields
71:13 evolve
71:14 battlefields change they're not static
71:16 right they're an evolving situation
71:18 and sometimes you have to move troops
71:20 around the battlefield
71:21 in order to to to to win the battle
71:24 right that's not uncommon you don't just
71:26 sit there uh in in
71:28 rank and file and just march forward you
71:31 you have to adapt with the environment
71:32 and the
71:33 the situation as it's evolving and
71:35 that's very much
71:36 what what i'm doing this is again a long
71:38 game let me remind people
71:40 that you know we have achieved a lot in
71:43 three years but i think if we want to
71:45 achieve more in the next three years
71:47 we have to adapt we have to adapt we
71:49 have to continue
71:50 moving the ball forward and sometimes
71:52 you look at a football game right
71:55 the quarterback doesn't do the same
71:56 thing every time
71:58 the quarterbacks got to change plays
72:00 otherwise you know
72:01 the guys know what you're doing and then
72:02 they figure you're out and you lose the
72:04 game so
72:05 you gotta you gotta
72:08 you can't ever take for granted
72:11 the battle space that we're operating in
72:13 and i say battle space because i know
72:14 you get people oh there's that threat
72:15 narrative again no no it's just the way
72:17 i talk i'm a military guy right so
72:19 i i look at everything as a military
72:21 style campaign or an intelligence
72:23 campaign right
72:24 it's a multi-prong it's it's a
72:26 multi-dimensional battle space
72:28 i tell people you know there's several
72:30 ways you can look at the battle space
72:32 some people
72:33 look at battle space like the game
72:34 connect four some people look at the
72:36 battle space like
72:37 checkers some people look at the battle
72:39 space like three-dimensional chess
72:41 and that's kind of the way i think you
72:44 know
72:44 we need to look at this this this is no
72:46 different this is a very complex highly
72:49 evolving
72:50 topic where we're learning every day
72:52 more and more and more
72:54 so we have to maintain our our momentum
72:57 by always
72:59 adapting to to the environment and
73:02 anticipating not just
73:03 the environment of tomorrow but the
73:05 environment next week next month
73:07 next year so we can stay ahead will you
73:10 you asked me another question i didn't
73:11 want to
73:11 will you stay connected with that crada
73:13 agreement uh
73:14 or are you essentially out of that yeah
73:18 well uh okay so again as it relates to
73:21 ttsa
73:22 i can't speak about that i can tell you
73:24 that we're always looking for
73:25 opportunities for new partnerships
73:27 right this being a perfect example you
73:29 and i having this conversation this is a
73:31 partnership
73:32 this is this is what it is you know uh
73:34 whether you like me or hate me or i like
73:36 you or hate you or whatever
73:38 we're all working with each other
73:39 because because we realize
73:42 i'm sorry i said you hate me no no no no
73:45 i'm just saying
73:46 i'm just general terms you know whether
73:48 we like or hate each other no actually
73:50 for the record actually i like you
73:52 but that's inconsequential doesn't
73:53 matter if i like you that's my point the
73:55 point is that
73:55 we each have a role to play and and
73:58 we we need each other if we want to
74:01 continue to push the ball down
74:03 down the field just like we need
74:04 everybody else right now on social media
74:07 in this in this crazy grassroots effort
74:10 we need to call
74:11 ufo twitter right or or the uap research
74:14 uh
74:15 enclave i mean it's working it's working
74:18 again i can tell people don't look now
74:19 but
74:20 you're achieving what you what you're
74:22 setting out to do so
74:23 um i i think people shouldn't be
74:26 surprised if i continue to
74:28 to engage certain elements in the u.s
74:30 government
74:31 for the purposes of research um that
74:34 that that's probably a no-brainer i
74:35 think most people should
74:37 if they see that that shouldn't be a
74:39 surprise
74:41 well look i can ask you questions all
74:42 day i'm down to 6437 left to go
74:46 my guess is we're probably not not uh
74:48 you know in a position to ask them all
74:50 right now
74:50 so tell you what i hope that after this
74:53 last
74:54 hour or so that you will come back
74:57 uh that that you will continue
75:00 um this conversation with me because i
75:03 hope that you've realized not only
75:05 through this last hour but obviously
75:06 we've shared a lot of conversations
75:08 privately
75:08 uh you know and and and i hope you know
75:11 where i'm coming from
75:12 and you started this with an apology to
75:14 me and i want to end it with one to you
75:17 i caught myself by critiquing the story
75:20 that was coming out
75:22 then starting to shift towards uh it
75:24 being personal
75:26 not by intent but it came off that way
75:29 and for you
75:30 i apologize i've already done it
75:31 privately but i want to do it publicly
75:33 no worries john no worries listen we're
75:36 this is
75:36 we're in this together man and and this
75:38 is something that i think
75:40 you know my concern for you my biggest
75:41 concern i've told you this privately
75:43 just having me on your show i'm
75:45 concerned that they're going to be some
75:46 of your
75:47 your followers fans uh you know folks
75:50 your associates
75:51 that may criticize you for this they may
75:52 say oh you're drinking the kool-aid oh
75:55 you know you're you're falling for
75:58 misinformation for lou
75:59 i hope that's not the case for you i
76:01 really hope that
76:02 by doing having this conversation
76:04 together people realize on both sides
76:07 that you know we
76:09 can work together we should be working
76:11 together
76:12 um i i hope this doesn't have any
76:14 negative
76:15 impact for you if anybody out there is
76:17 listening and they think that
76:18 this is some sort of scheme you and i
76:20 came up with it's not
76:22 uh what you see is what you get this is
76:24 very um
76:25 frank john did not you did not load me
76:28 with any
76:28 questions beforehand everything you've
76:31 asked me uh you've asked me without me
76:33 knowing ahead of time
76:35 um so hopefully people see that level of
76:37 transparency
76:39 and um you know maybe we
76:42 we can show them that you know we all
76:44 can work together yeah we should be
76:46 working
76:46 and i hope that this serves as an
76:48 example of that you've been so gracious
76:49 with your time i blew through the agreed
76:52 amount so i appreciate your willingness
76:54 to take a little bit more time with me
76:56 you're welcome back anytime you know my
76:57 number you know my email
76:59 please uh no john you got mine same
77:01 thing people know just give me a call
77:03 give me uh
77:04 give me a couple days head notice
77:05 because i do have a honey-do list i have
77:07 to i
77:07 have to stay on top of but uh i'm happy
77:11 to have a conversation anytime
77:12 absolutely been my honor and pleasure
77:14 and i really appreciate it by the way
77:15 thank you for what you do
77:16 i'm telling you you are and i've told
77:18 people this privately i told them
77:20 publicly
77:20 there's only one john greenwald that can
77:22 do what that does what you do
77:24 um it's it's amazing what you've been
77:27 able to achieve and accomplish
77:29 using the government system against
77:32 itself
77:33 um that takes a high degree of savvy and
77:35 sophistication that not everybody really
77:37 understands or appreciates uh but um
77:41 you know i i see it with you and you
77:43 play a vital role so thank you for what
77:45 you do well i appreciate that i always
77:46 love ruffling feathers wherever those
77:48 feathers may lie
77:49 so thank you for that and you're really
77:51 good at it
77:52 thanks i appreciate that and thanks
77:54 again for your time
77:56 and your graciousness and thank you all
77:58 for listening and or watching this is
78:00 john greenwald jr signing off
78:02 we'll see you next time
78:14 you 

==========4SD2i-yF1gQ==========

00:00 you uh one of the few sensitive
00:01 questions that that i
00:03 talked about in the beginning and that
00:04 is the paperwork that came out through
00:06 foia
00:06 i went after those documents as you know
00:09 uh we've talked about this privately but
00:11 i went after those documents for those
00:12 listening and watching that aren't aware
00:14 and and
00:14 found the emails that you were sharing
00:16 back and forth uh
00:18 with what is called dobser and that is
00:19 the arm that essentially will authorize
00:22 either public use or uh essentially them
00:25 declassifying something or something is
00:26 unclassified clearing it for release
00:28 and so on just kind of quickly summarize
00:30 it those documents come out in
00:32 in the form uh that had already leaked
00:35 in part had come out
00:36 uh but that was kind of re-verified on
00:39 an official level
00:40 and the way you would describe the
00:42 videos uh is what it
00:44 what really kind of intrigues me in a
00:47 way
00:48 that is a big fat question mark and that
00:51 is that you describe the flare the
00:52 gimbal and the go fast
00:54 as balloons uh drones and uas's
00:58 and what kind of confuses me about that
01:01 is dobster is cleared at the top secret
01:04 level so they've got the you know jwix
01:07 protocols to send them
01:08 to let's say top secret data and they
01:10 review it they can say
01:12 nope you can't use this whatsoever but
01:14 they have those channels
01:16 i've heard but i want to ask from you
01:18 because i don't think i've ever asked
01:19 you
01:20 this part before i've only heard from
01:22 others through
01:23 you know third hand info that you felt
01:26 that
01:26 you couldn't inform them properly
01:30 but again i want to ask you this why
01:33 were the videos described
01:35 in that way if they would be cleared at
01:37 the top secret level
01:39 sure so if you look at the way dobster
01:41 works you're actually supposed to do the
01:43 requests at the unclassified level
01:45 so there's several dod instructions and
01:48 direct actually
01:48 instructions uh and manuals and then
01:51 there's some some brochures on
01:53 how you're supposed to request something
01:55 for publication
01:56 i mean that can be disseminated out and
01:59 that is through
02:00 an unclassified document 1910 02:04 and when you ask dobson they say please
02:05 send it to us unclassified level so
02:08 we had just gotten over the the this
02:10 this awful situation with wikileaks
02:12 where we
02:13 knew foreign adversaries were hacking
02:15 our systems that's a fact that's
02:17 that's that's not conjecture and and the
02:19 us government acknowledged that
02:21 and then of course you had insider
02:23 threats where you had
02:24 uh look i don't want to get political
02:26 here but there's you know
02:27 whether you're for or against but folks
02:29 like like private manning
02:31 uh that that took some very sensitive
02:33 information and released in an
02:34 unauthorized manner so
02:36 because we were dealing with something
02:38 that was so sensitive and there was so
02:40 few people that were read onto the
02:41 program and i couldn't even brief
02:43 my boss at the time about this this
02:45 program
02:46 i couldn't very well brief dobson who's
02:50 two and three degrees removed from my
02:53 own chain of command
02:54 and mentioned the word ufo so
02:58 the uas we had
03:01 coined for unidentified aerial systems
03:03 some say
03:04 unmanned aerial systems but literally
03:07 a uas is an unmanned or
03:10 uh uh system that's not
03:14 manned by a human being so that's that's
03:16 actually a a
03:18 legitimate term that we could use
03:20 without saying
03:21 ufo or uap knowing that the oca
03:25 the original classification authority
03:27 who dobson would have to go back to
03:28 anyways
03:29 right to get the approval was right onto
03:31 the program
03:32 and knew exactly what this was about so
03:35 so
03:35 um you know a lot of people say well was
03:37 that disingenuous we were trying to
03:38 mislead no no no everybody was about
03:40 everybody knew what we were talking
03:41 about
03:42 but it was a way that we could protect
03:43 this from having some sort of what we
03:45 call an inadvertent disclosure this
03:47 information getting out
03:48 to somebody who wasn't read on and all
03:51 of a sudden now
03:52 the whole department is aware of what's
03:54 going on so that's
03:56 that's how that's how that if you will
03:59 that process
04:00 gotcha occur okay so one of the other
04:02 things on the the same
04:03 form was internally you only intended
04:06 this for
04:07 internal government use only not in
04:10 correct
04:10 initially correct initially that's what
04:12 we were we wanted to create a
04:15 an internal enclave unclassified so you
04:18 know the public
04:20 could we put industry partners because
04:22 that's broad enough where
04:23 if you're working with the united states
04:25 government in any type of capacity
04:27 you can be labeled as a type of industry
04:29 partner so whether you're
04:31 local law enforcement or your faa
04:34 or you're one of the services or you
04:37 know
04:38 whoever if you're working in some sort
04:39 of kind of official capacity
04:41 we wanted to get people who had a had
04:44 certain expertise
04:44 open the aperture so we could get more
04:46 scientists more people to look at this
04:48 data and help us try to figure it out
04:50 and that was what you
04:51 internally called the community of
04:53 interest right or coi
04:55 which which yeah i've always once those
04:58 emails kind of revealed themselves
04:59 through
05:00 foia i was always intrigued by that
05:01 because that sounds like wow why didn't
05:03 they do this prior so
05:05 you know i've as some outsiders yeah one
05:08 would think
05:08 right so that uh and by the way i've
05:10 gone after i think i may have told you
05:12 privately but
05:12 trying to find more information if any
05:14 is there that they take that idea
05:16 because
05:17 from what i've seen when you look at
05:18 these types there's a lot more info
05:20 john well that's plugging away
05:22 absolutely right that's what i'm
05:23 that's what i'm going for so so but at
05:26 very admirable intention there but again
05:28 i just wanted to ask
05:30 according to the dod anyway
05:33 that those videos had to adhere to what
05:36 was on that
05:36 what they call the dd form 1910 which we
05:38 didn't label it yet
05:40 but the dd form 1910 was again for that
05:43 that
05:43 private u.s government use only and
05:47 when christopher mellon had come out
05:48 recently he had said that he supplied
05:51 those videos to the new york times then
05:53 in the james fox's great documentary
05:55 getting rave reviews
05:57 around the world james i've known for a
05:59 very long time
06:00 so quick shout out to him make sure you
06:02 watch his new documentary
06:03 yeah he did a fantastic job he really
06:05 did yeah he's he's a he's a great human
06:07 being i know how much blood sweat and
06:08 tears went into that just from knowing
06:10 him personally so
06:11 my kudos to him uh but in that
06:13 christopher mellon came out and said
06:14 somebody
06:15 didn't name them but somebody bent the
06:18 rules that was
06:19 what his wording was which i want to
06:23 juxtapose that with
06:24 how we were shown the videos from to the
06:26 stars academy
06:27 i don't expect you to speak for to the
06:29 stars i'm not asking you to
06:31 but i do want to ask about what they
06:33 called the chain of custody because
06:35 that's another one of those disconnects
06:37 where paperwork says internal use only
06:40 cleared for that then we see the videos
06:42 and it
06:43 they were kind of advertised at well not
06:45 kind of they were advertised as going
06:48 through the declassification process
06:49 through dod
06:51 and they had chain of custody
06:55 documentation and that has always
06:58 confused me
06:58 because that for me anyway i found the
07:02 dod chain of custody forms and stuff
07:03 like that
07:04 it just wouldn't apply is that accurate
07:07 so what is that changing custody you
07:09 know i can't speak for chris mellon and
07:11 quite frankly i've never asked chris i
07:13 don't want to know
07:14 um you know there's i hate to say
07:16 plausible deniability is sometimes a
07:18 good thing
07:19 um but out of respect for chris i i've
07:21 never asked him
07:23 this source and i don't really plan to
07:25 to be honest with you that's between
07:27 chris and and
07:28 whoever he talked to um
07:31 you know the how ttsa
07:35 wound up putting them forward um
07:39 i will tell you if you were to ask me
07:42 you know i
07:43 i probably would have been more hesitant
07:45 to do that but
07:46 you know it happened um and it happened
07:49 without me
07:50 knowing um that really was so you had no
07:53 idea that they
07:53 that they were gonna release those
07:55 videos
07:57 uh not until the uh new york times
08:00 article
08:01 yeah i that was not um i i was not a
08:05 i was not aware um
08:08 yeah so were you aware they had them if
08:11 i can ask that
08:17 no actually let me think
08:24 john i i don't recall i i really don't i
08:26 don't think because i remember being
08:28 very surprised
08:29 uh because the intent originally was for
08:32 a
08:33 community of interest and unclassified
08:35 but for official use only if you will
08:37 community of interest and i
08:41 i didn't i wasn't the one who who
08:43 provided them so
08:44 i really don't know what ttsa was
08:47 thinking you probably want to talk to
08:48 them as you know i'm no longer
08:52 publicly affiliated with with ttsa
08:54 they're they're great people
08:55 tom's a great guy you know we can still
08:57 talk uh
08:59 but um i i can't speak for ttx i got you
09:01 no i and i understand that
09:03 and respect that
09:14 you 

==========IV4-d4Q5MEY==========

00:00 take me back to the beginning if you
00:01 could on how you became
00:04 involved in atip and exactly how that
00:07 came to be
00:08 how did i get involved um let's rewind
00:10 the clock to about 2008. now give you
00:13 kind of the
00:14 synopsis of how all this evolved i was
00:16 working uh prior to that at the
00:19 office of the director of national
00:20 intelligence uh i was a
00:22 senior intelligence officer working um
00:25 policy
00:26 strategy things like that and to me
00:28 quite frankly uh frank with you the
00:30 the drive was killing me i was living on
00:32 maryland's eastern shore at the time
00:33 and you're looking at a three-hour
00:35 commute one way um i loved my job i love
00:37 the people but the commute was killing
00:39 me
00:39 so at the time um it was then under
00:43 secretary of defense for intelligence
00:44 jim clapper
00:46 was over at the usdi and he was the
00:48 under secretary of defense
00:50 for intelligence at the time uh and a
00:52 man i respected greatly
00:54 and i was given an opportunity to come
00:56 back to dod for about a year
00:58 to to work some some new efforts
01:01 particularly in intelligence sharing law
01:03 enforcement information integration
01:05 and so i i came back very eager because
01:08 my
01:08 my daily commute was cut about in half
01:11 all of a sudden
01:12 and i had my a little bit more of my
01:14 life back so i went back to dod
01:16 and it was at that time i was working um
01:19 in the
01:20 national capital region ncr region where
01:23 um
01:23 some people had come to my to my desk we
01:25 were working i wasn't in
01:26 the pentagon at the time we were working
01:28 at a remote location but still connected
01:30 to the pentagon
01:32 and uh you know it's it's it's kind of
01:34 bizarre because like out of a movie
01:37 um these two people i still remember
01:39 today very clearly from what they were
01:40 wearing
01:40 very nicely dressed uh and um i remember
01:43 someone knocking on the door and said mr
01:45 alexander
01:46 there's some people here to see you
01:47 which which is not uncommon you're
01:49 always working issues
01:50 so you're trying to fix things uh so
01:52 sure bring them on and they came in
01:54 and uh they said hey uh you're you're
01:57 luis alexander and yes i am lou uh can
02:00 we talk to you
02:01 and i said sure and one of them shut the
02:03 door behind them my door
02:05 i'm like okay this is probably not good
02:08 you know
02:08 uh i often joke you know what did i do
02:10 now right um
02:12 i probably upset somebody and uh they
02:15 sat down
02:16 and uh they started to say you know hey
02:18 look uh we we are part of the
02:20 intelligence community
02:22 uh we're part of a program we're not
02:23 going to tell you much about it but
02:25 uh do you mind telling us a little bit
02:27 about yourself and
02:28 uh i i probably was a little rude i
02:30 probably was a little bit standoffish
02:32 because i don't particularly like
02:34 talking about myself especially if i
02:36 don't know who you are
02:37 um and they start asking very pointy
02:40 questions
02:40 specifically about you know we hear that
02:42 you're you're you're a
02:42 counterintelligence guy we hear that you
02:44 did some background uh before
02:46 you have some background uh in advanced
02:48 avionics and aerospace industry
02:51 uh is that true yes do you mind sharing
02:53 with us i said well i'll share with you
02:55 at the unclassified level the type of
02:57 systems i've worked on but i'm really
02:58 not comfortable going into
02:59 more detail it's a long story short they
03:02 agreed to
03:04 to they would come back and have another
03:05 discussion with me um
03:07 and so when they left i ran some trap
03:09 lines to find out that they were legit
03:11 they were part of a special
03:13 program but i didn't have clearance into
03:15 it so i really didn't know but
03:16 they really were who they said they were
03:18 they were part of a small organization
03:20 and
03:20 i presume that the time had something to
03:21 do with aerospace
03:23 but i really didn't know and then a
03:26 couple more trips they came by we talked
03:28 got a little bit more comfortable they
03:29 got more comfortable with me i certainly
03:30 got more comfortable with them
03:32 and finally they said we'd like to uh
03:34 have you meet
03:35 our director and i said okay sure no
03:37 problem
03:38 uh it might have been john probably
03:42 seven or ten days later we i had an
03:44 appointment to go meet that i was hoping
03:46 the director would come see me
03:48 i thought i was sufficiently senior
03:50 enough where you know you want to come
03:52 see me you can come see me instead
03:53 they're like okay be at this location at
03:55 this time at this place and don't tell
03:57 anybody you're coming
03:58 uh so again a little bit unusual i'm
04:00 like you know i'm sorry who are you
04:02 so um i decided to go ahead and do it
04:05 and uh i told my deputy that time hey
04:06 i'm gonna go
04:07 go to this meeting um i went to it and
04:10 uh it was an undisclosed location in
04:12 also the national capital region
04:14 uh look just like a normal office
04:16 building really uh until you go inside
04:18 then you realize that you have
04:19 you know guards and whatnot you're like
04:21 okay no this is probably a little bit
04:23 more more sensitive
04:24 remember going up the elevator up to the
04:26 floor and uh it looked like a
04:28 it looked like an office building you
04:30 would see like on wall street really
04:32 um you know cubicles all over the place
04:35 and people kind of
04:36 making copies and doing work diligently
04:38 on their computers
04:40 and there was this corner office um kind
04:43 of looked like a
04:44 glass you know the individual sitting
04:46 back in there and what struck me is that
04:48 the individual
04:49 was i don't want to stereotype but if
04:52 you would ever think of what a rocket
04:53 scientist looks like he was your
04:56 quintessential rocket scientist
04:58 glasses uh you know very very
05:01 look look appeared very astute um
05:04 and very no-nonsense um so i went i
05:08 introduced myself shirkazhan hey i'm
05:10 glad you're here he didn't smile he was
05:12 just very serious and he was
05:14 man he looked at me he was staring at me
05:16 i i felt almost a little uncomfortable
05:18 because i know he was assessing the hell
05:20 out of me
05:21 and i was trying to assess him as well
05:22 but obviously he probably knew a little
05:24 bit more about me than i knew about him
05:27 uh which is never really good to go into
05:28 a meeting like that as an intelligence
05:30 officer you know you
05:31 kind of want to if you will know thy
05:33 enemy uh not saying he was my enemy by
05:35 any stretch but
05:36 you know you wonder who you're dealing
05:37 with uh and he introduced himself
05:40 and um i'm sure at some point his name
05:43 will become
05:44 become very public i i have i have out
05:46 of respect for him i've never mentioned
05:47 his name uh he's asked me never to
05:49 mention it uh
05:50 until he's comfortable with with his
05:52 name being out so i won't
05:54 um but we talked we had a very good
05:57 candid conversation
05:58 and that's when he asked me i mean he
06:00 started he started asking me about my
06:01 background
06:02 in uh in aerospace and the type of
06:04 technologies i've worked on
06:06 and um you know this is a guy who i
06:10 really he knew his stuff
06:11 and he was like literally a rock
06:12 literally by definition a rocket
06:14 scientist
06:15 and probably one of the best ones that
06:16 we had in the government um
06:19 and that's when you know he asked me
06:20 said what do you what do you think about
06:22 um man it was you know john
06:25 he looked him straight in the face and
06:27 looking back it's it was so
06:29 weird because i wasn't sure if he was
06:30 like testing me or if it was legit but
06:32 he said
06:33 what do you think about the topic of
06:35 ufos
06:37 now coming from my world you know we'll
06:39 to test somebody we will use provocative
06:42 statements sometimes and then gauge
06:44 their body language and you know micro
06:45 behaviors and neural linguistics uh
06:48 to see if you know they're prone to you
06:49 know flights of fancy and things like
06:52 that you know
06:53 and uh but he was he was looking to be
06:55 very serious and they said well i
06:58 i don't really think about ufos he says
07:01 what you don't think they're real i said
07:02 no no i didn't say that i just
07:04 i never really had the luxury to think
07:06 about ufos you know i'm not particularly
07:08 a huge science fiction fan i
07:09 never really watched x-files or anything
07:11 like that uh
07:13 and i've been so consumed with my work
07:15 that when i'm not working i'm at home
07:17 and i'm a father but those are really
07:19 the only things i ever have time for
07:21 work and and which didn't involve
07:23 anything at all involving some of those
07:24 clearly and um and and raising a family
07:29 so he said okay that's that's fair um
07:32 and he said but let me let me uh just
07:35 caution you
07:35 to caution you or warn you something to
07:37 that effect let me caution you
07:39 that um don't let your analytic bias
07:43 get in the way and he said you're gonna
07:47 you're gonna see things that you may not
07:49 you may have a hard time reconciling now
07:51 at this point i hadn't even accepted it
07:53 i didn't i hadn't been offered even
07:54 really a job right so
07:56 i'm thinking to myself are you are you
07:58 is this a pitch are you offering me a
07:59 job
08:00 or this just is this just advice for
08:02 life you know to take with me
08:03 and what what the hell is really going
08:05 on here
08:07 so uh i nodded my head and said no you
08:09 know very
08:10 very fair point right um i don't really
08:12 have an opinion yet
08:13 on it and then we agreed uh have another
08:16 conversation but he said look i'm
08:17 looking for a counterintelligence guy
08:20 um for those in your audience you may
08:23 not know what really counter
08:24 intelligence is you know a lot of people
08:25 think they know what ci
08:27 is ci is is really um knowing what the
08:30 enemy knows about you
08:31 right so so foreign intelligence
08:33 collection is is learning what the bad
08:35 guys know
08:36 counter intelligence is knowing what the
08:37 bad guys know about you so if you think
08:39 of a chess
08:40 board um if you are playing chess
08:43 against an opponent
08:44 um you know foreign intelligence is
08:47 knowing what their pieces can do on the
08:49 chessboard and how they plan to move
08:51 counterintelligence is knowing what they
08:53 know about your pieces right and how you
08:55 can move so
08:56 uh it's it's yet another layer of of
08:59 of playing chess to some degree i guess
09:01 um you know not any better or worse in
09:03 other
09:03 forms of intelligence it's just it's a
09:05 very niche uh
09:06 way of doing business uh from an
09:08 intelligence perspective
09:10 so uh he started looking for a
09:11 counterintelligence guy um
09:13 because we know that there are some
09:14 foreign countries foreign adversaries
09:16 out there that
09:17 probably know what we're doing and i i
09:19 need a good
09:20 counterintelligence and security program
09:22 which by the way it's not unusual um
09:24 anytime you have a sensitive program
09:26 uh you know you you want to have you
09:29 want to have good security and counter
09:30 intelligence expertise it's just
09:32 it's just an extra layer of if you will
09:35 insurance to have to to protect your
09:38 program
09:39 so it wasn't unusual that i was that i
09:41 was being asked to provide
09:42 counterintelligence expertise i wasn't
09:43 being asked to do anything with ufos per
09:45 se
09:46 it was just to come in and provide you
09:48 know the background that i already have
09:50 just use that in this capacity
09:52 so um ultimately long story short of it
09:55 obviously the rest is history
09:56 uh no pun intended i i i secure i'll
10:00 i'll accept the job um and it was at
10:03 that point
10:04 um through through various conversations
10:07 afterwards i began to realize that
10:09 these guys are legit they're real i mean
10:10 they have like real data
10:12 and uh the individuals that they started
10:14 that were part of this effort i knew
10:16 from before
10:17 like people like how toud off and
10:18 whatnot that were you know there were
10:20 kind of legends in their own time
10:22 anyways
10:23 um so i knew this was a serious
10:25 legitimate effort and then i began to
10:27 see the documentation
10:28 uh from the senate and congress and i
10:31 really began to
10:32 recognize that this was a full-fledged
10:34 program but they really did need counter
10:36 intelligence expertise they didn't have
10:38 anything
10:38 so they were kind of they were kind of
10:40 vulnerable from that perspective
10:51 you

07:45 southern texas
07:46 earlier today ahead of the launch
07:49 the company said the starship would be
07:51 powered by three of its raptor engines
07:53 before they shut off and
07:55 uh all of this sequentially at a height
07:57 of 10 07:58 kilometers the starship was then due to
08:01 land back down
08:02 under active aerodynamic control before
08:04 the engines powered back
08:06 on to flip it into a vertical position

14:56 certainly with you on that and you
14:57 probably
14:59 have thought that tonight's conversation
15:01 would never happen
15:02 and i get that too but let me
15:06 make a few things clear in advance
15:09 of lou joining us at the bottom of the
15:11 hour okay
15:14 first i have said this many
15:18 many times over the last few years
15:22 when it comes to ttsa
15:25 before we put all of our complete
15:29 trust in them and their mission
15:32 we have to let some time pass
15:36 a couple of years at a minimum
15:40 then we'll be able to see what's really
15:42 going on
15:43 now that has been my position
15:46 my take on this has not changed
15:51 and this mindset is the same with
15:55 anyone or any group that comes along
15:59 into the ufo field trust in this
16:02 community is earned it is not a right
16:08 second the marketing and public
16:12 relations
16:13 that were behind ttsa was strong
16:18 and being able to fund these efforts
16:21 takes money
16:23 ttsa was willing to spend it
16:27 ttsa was employing some of the best
16:30 pr in the business all of this to
16:34 get their message out and for
16:37 that we should all be thankful
16:41 okay i'm very very grateful
16:45 i am and i've said this
16:49 over and over again
16:53 okay i can't say it enough ttsa was able
16:57 to get the ufo question into the
17:00 worldwide media like
17:01 never before in the history of the
17:03 subject
17:07 they did any
17:11 criticism of ttsa
17:14 that has gone down out there in
17:17 conversations with the ufo community and
17:19 beyond
17:21 all of that was always answered with but
17:25 yeah you may be right but yeah you're
17:28 probably right
17:29 but they've done more for
17:32 ufos than anybody else in the history of
17:35 anything they brought it into the media
17:36 we've got tucker carlson we've got cnn
17:38 we've got the bbc
17:40 everybody is talking about we've got the
17:42 new york times
17:43 yes absolutely 100 17:47 correct now i want to go back and i will
17:51 say this again back on december 17 2017 17:57 is driving my car listening to kfi
18:01 talk radio here in los angeles listening
18:04 to the breaking news i'm just driving my
18:06 car down the road
18:08 well it was announced today by the new
18:10 york times that the pentagon has a
18:12 secret ufo group that is
18:16 investigating ufos
18:19 and i almost crashed my car and that
18:23 is not some metaphor
18:27 i listened to that and by the time i got
18:30 home
18:31 i had heard this three times on the
18:34 radio
18:35 i'm jumping on my cell phone while i'm
18:37 driving which is illegal i get i get
18:40 home i'm i'm talking to rita
18:43 phones are just ringing and
18:47 that night we went live
18:50 on a saturday with fade to black the
18:53 days of disclosure here we go
18:56 i was excited okay
18:59 i realize what a good pr team
19:02 can do okay
19:06 are we clear third
19:10 just over
19:13 just over a couple of years ago as the
19:16 questions about ttsa started to get
19:18 asked
19:19 by me and others i sent an email to tom
19:23 and everyone over at ttsa
19:27 and i also had a couple of journalists
19:31 copied in that email too as well i
19:33 wanted everybody to make sure that
19:35 uh there was no questions about
19:38 the list of questions that email
19:42 had a list of 10 questions that i wanted
19:45 addressed
19:46 and i got replies immediately
19:50 and those replies from different
19:53 individuals
19:56 were basically quote jimmy quit asking
19:59 questions
20:00 you don't understand the big picture we
20:02 do
20:04 and and some of these replies were from
20:07 some people that i know
20:09 quite well and
20:13 i was not digging that
20:17 skating the issues the last time i spoke
20:22 with tom delong
20:24 was last summer and
20:28 uh we talked about at that time
20:32 we talked about him coming on the show
20:36 on fade to black to to promote
20:38 unidentified
20:41 and and i agreed to it
20:45 and he said at that time
20:49 that and i'm quoting here he said i
20:52 don't want to answer any questions
20:54 that the ufo community wants you to ask
20:58 me as i wait a minute
21:02 tom i said well
21:05 tom we don't have a show then
21:09 and that was it
21:12 that was it that was a year ago
21:16 i knew at that point
21:19 that when it comes to ttsa in the future
21:23 i'll just report the breaking news when
21:25 it happens
21:26 and i said this publicly i think i
21:29 posted it i mentioned it on the show
21:32 but at the time i meant it and i'm still
21:34 there today
21:37 and that was because of the conversation
21:39 i had with tom i need all of you to
21:41 understand this
21:44 and lastly
21:49 this is all of this ultimately
21:52 is why i had said that ttsa
21:56 would never let lou come on the show
21:59 that this would ever happen you know
22:02 back then it was a different it was a
22:03 different situation and i was asking
22:05 questions and i was poking around
22:07 and they wanted to control the narrative
22:09 they wanted to control it that's fine
22:12 but i knew that having lou on the show
22:15 and people were asking me about this and
22:16 that includes
22:17 chris mellon you know or anyone else
22:20 over at ttsa
22:21 but this would never happen ever but
22:24 today
22:26 things have changed
22:29 now and i need this to be very clear
22:33 here
22:34 there was so much drama that went on
22:37 behind the scenes
22:39 things that will never be talked about
22:43 not even in my tell-all book that'll be
22:45 my death
22:46 bed confession right
22:50 i just won't talk about it ever
22:53 it's just who i am and today lou finds
22:57 himself in the same position
23:00 there's no reason everyone
23:03 for drama and i know that there are
23:06 those
23:07 out there that thrive on it but
23:10 it's just not going to happen folks not
23:12 tonight
23:13 and not ever
23:16 but that doesn't mean i won't ask the
23:20 tough questions tonight
23:23 and trust me lou is expecting them
23:26 he wants them and
23:29 i think that in the past he's gotten way
23:32 too many
23:33 underarm slow pitch softballs
23:37 and i mean that with the greatest of
23:38 respect but what's the fun in that
23:42 what's the fun in that for lou there's
23:44 no fun in that
23:46 you have to ask the tough questions
23:49 what's the fun in that well i'll answer
23:51 that for you
23:53 none there is no fun
23:56 you got to do it all right
23:59 all right i mean i i i want i want lou
24:03 i said this to him today i want lou to
24:05 say hey
24:06 i can't answer that i want him
24:09 because that allows me to
24:13 press and have a follow-up question
24:16 that's exactly what that is it's my job
24:19 we'll see what we can do okay
24:23 now i'll never forget
24:28 when someone from ttsa
24:31 to me straight in the eye straight in
24:35 the eye
24:35 face to face straight in the eye and
24:37 said and i quote
24:40 jimmy we don't care about the ufo
24:42 community
24:43 their support or concerns just doesn't
24:46 matter
24:47 they don't know the truth about ufos we
24:51 do
24:52 end quote and i just stood there trying
24:54 to keep my composure and i did
24:56 i was cool now when
25:00 these words are said to me
25:03 you don't have to wonder why i started
25:05 to poke around into ttsa and what their
25:07 message was to the world
25:09 and who was doing it yes
25:13 i was on a mission and now you know why
25:17 or at least the stuff i can talk about
25:21 so in closing i'll leave you with this
25:27 i've been chasing the ufo question for
25:30 almost 50 years
25:33 five decades of dedication
25:37 and i truly believe that we are closer
25:40 than ever before
25:42 to real answers from official sources
25:45 i can feel it and you can feel it too
25:50 now there is a time and a place
25:54 for everything everything happens for a
25:59 reason
26:02 and right now it's fade to black

34:02 lou
34:02 it's just you and i sitting on my couch
34:04 having a conversation as friends
34:06 where that conversation starts it's
34:08 we're going to end his friends
34:09 there you go simple now absolutely
34:12 okay i'm going to start with a general
34:15 statement
34:16 uh for everybody so they understand
34:19 uh this conversation that we are about
34:22 to have
34:23 um this conversation is unscripted
34:26 it's uncentered uh uh uncensored
34:29 uncentered it'll be that too as well
34:32 and um unrehearsed and
34:35 uh i have zero questions prepared
34:39 and you have stressed to me over the
34:42 last week
34:43 jimmy ask me anything and i want the
34:47 uh the audience to understand that this
34:49 is
34:50 what they are going to get tonight are
34:51 we on the same page lou
34:53 you got it all right now let's start
34:56 here i i'm going to start
34:58 um uh to clear the air
35:02 for everybody and for the audience
35:03 tonight and and i want to say this
35:06 clandestine operations uh
35:09 counterintelligence
35:10 uh secret operations going on overseas
35:13 special agent james bond right
35:17 um how can the audience
35:21 trust the conversation with
35:24 tonight with your background that you
35:27 have been
35:28 very uh forthwith about
35:32 how can they trust the conversation that
35:33 we are about to have
35:35 well they don't have to trust it um you
35:38 know frankly i
35:39 the purpose of me being on this radio
35:41 show is nothing more than to get the
35:44 conversation to
35:45 to continue uh moving forward i think
35:48 dialogue is very important i'm not
35:50 asking anybody to believe me i'm not
35:52 asking anybody to agree with me
35:54 i'm not asking anybody to take my side
35:57 in fact i think uh contrary positions
36:00 and opinions are good
36:01 i think they're healthy and i think
36:02 that's what what conversation is about
36:05 and the fact that we can even have this
36:07 conversation
36:08 on this radio program about this topic
36:10 in this country says a lot
36:12 and at the end of the day if all i
36:14 accomplish uh
36:15 in this radio program are more people
36:18 having the conversation then i've
36:19 succeeded
36:20 um to answer your question why trust me
36:23 don't i don't really give a damn
36:24 people trust me or not the bottom line
36:27 is
36:27 that my my background in intelligence
36:30 has been used
36:31 against the enemy and the enemy in this
36:33 case are are are not americans
36:35 the these skills that i've i've learned
36:39 for the past 20 some odd years has been
36:42 used
36:43 in in combat and in warfare against the
36:45 enemy
36:46 i swore an oath and allegiance to
36:48 protect this country from all enemies
36:50 foreign and domestic
36:51 you know i was on the other side of the
36:54 firing line my job was to protect
36:55 americans not
36:56 not uh deceive them yes it's true that
36:59 within the world of counterintelligence
37:01 and intelligence
37:02 uh you learn a lot of tradecraft and
37:04 that tradecraft uh when
37:06 employed against the enemy can be very
37:07 very effective but you never use it
37:09 against your own people
37:10 in the past i think there's people who
37:12 have long memories in the 60s uh
37:14 and and of course in this early 70s
37:17 there was a history of abuse by the
37:19 american government and its people
37:21 against people uh and there were things
37:23 that involved
37:25 horrible things atrocities from from
37:27 spying on
37:28 student groups and colleges to uh
37:30 horrible experiments uh involving uh
37:32 syphilis
37:33 and other type of things and of course
37:35 electric kool-aid acid tests
37:36 so so we haven't always behaved very
37:39 well uh as
37:40 intelligence personnel and so thankfully
37:42 congress decided to
37:43 to change the laws and make it very very
37:46 very difficult especially the last
37:48 quarter century for
37:50 anybody in the intelligence community to
37:52 do anything
37:53 wrong against the american people
37:55 there's actually laws now
37:57 preventing that from happening there's a
37:59 inspector general oversight there's
38:00 attorneys
38:02 so uh you know like you say in your your
38:05 radio broadcast this is not your
38:07 father's radio
38:08 uh station um this is not your father's
38:11 government
38:12 um we've come a long way in
38:15 in the way we do business and certainly
38:17 um
38:18 when i joined the military and then
38:19 later the u.s government and the
38:21 intelligence community
38:23 i didn't i didn't join to to harm the
38:25 american people i joined to help the
38:27 american people that's an oath i take
38:29 i take very seriously and ultimately at
38:31 the end of the day if people don't want
38:32 to believe it well
38:33 you know don't believe it that's that's
38:35 not what i'm here for
38:37 let's uh i want to start in the present
38:40 before we go
38:41 backwards uh tonight and but
38:45 uh let's let's start in it with today
38:49 why did you choose to leave ttsa
38:53 well that was a mutual decision uh ttsa
38:57 was a great company and it absolutely
38:59 accomplished the missions we set out
39:01 for it to accomplish and i i can go back
39:03 and and probably list off the top 10 39:05 things but
39:06 i'm not going to waste your time in your
39:07 audience's time rehashing that um
39:10 but bottom line is i think i think we
39:12 were successful in our mission
39:14 but let's not forget and i've said this
39:16 before
39:18 the the the battle space if you will of
39:20 disclosure is constantly evolving
39:23 um it's like when you're playing chess
39:24 you don't ever keep your pieces on the
39:26 chess board
39:27 static you win by moving and
39:30 outmaneuvering your enemy so in this
39:31 particular case
39:33 from my personal perspective the enemy
39:35 is is over secrecy
39:38 of this topic of uaps of ufos that
39:41 historically has plagued the government
39:42 for for a very long time
39:44 so in order to accomplish this goal the
39:46 battle space is constantly
39:48 evolving i think you have to evolve your
39:51 tactics and your strategy with it
39:53 being with ttsa was never the end game
39:56 for myself or chris mellon or steve
39:58 justice it was
40:00 at the time the appropriate step to take
40:03 to get the initial job done but
40:06 now that that initial job is complete we
40:09 are now moving
40:10 our pieces on the chessboard if you will
40:12 or in the battle space
40:14 to to now launch phase two of this
40:16 endeavor
40:17 um and i'll keep it i'll keep it simple
40:20 at that
40:20 well uh what what was
40:24 the mission was the mission and i want
40:27 to put words in your mouth but was
40:29 the mission to push this out into the
40:33 public
40:34 and into the media was that the mission
40:37 because if that was the mission
40:39 mission successful complete yeah let me
40:42 let me uh give you just a very quick
40:43 anecdote that the five pillars of our
40:45 emphasis
40:46 were always legislative uh engagement uh
40:49 senior executive
40:50 engagement in the executive branch uh
40:53 engagement with with foreign partners
40:54 and allies
40:56 and then the fourth pillar was engaging
40:58 the media and then the fifth pillar was
40:59 engaging the general public
41:01 and i think we did accomplish a lot of
41:04 what we set out to do initially
41:06 a lot of people ask well why tom delong
41:09 and my response to that is well why not
41:11 tom has a voice very much
41:14 like me being on your radio show today
41:16 uh you know
41:17 jimmy you are you are known as a radio
41:19 personality among many other things
41:21 and you have a voice whether whether
41:24 people want to agree with your position
41:25 or not
41:26 you have a voice and and as a result
41:28 people listen
41:30 well tom de long has a voice and
41:33 you don't always have to agree
41:34 necessarily with his perspective just
41:36 like you don't have to agree with mine
41:37 or anybody else's
41:38 but he's a very effective communicator
41:41 uh he made a history
41:43 and a very successful history of of
41:46 of in indian entertainment world and
41:48 being kind of that if you will that
41:50 shock rocker punk rocker uh that went
41:53 against the system
41:54 and if you look at the topic of ufos and
41:56 uaps
41:57 you know there's really a lot of synergy
41:59 there's a lot of commonality i'm looking
42:01 right now at your screen i see a bunch
42:02 of
42:02 you know awesome guitars electric
42:04 guitars hanging in the background
42:07 uh you know music and entertainment is
42:10 very effective way to communicate
42:13 and sometimes in a crowded room amongst
42:15 many voices
42:16 you need a bullhorn and and in this
42:18 particular case
42:19 uh very much like you tom is that
42:22 bullhorn
42:22 he he can he can get the message out
42:25 i've often
42:26 told people uh you know people ask me
42:29 isn't tom a little bit
42:30 like a like a bull in a china shop and
42:31 my response is well
42:33 no tom is more like a hand grenade in in
42:35 the punch bowl i mean it's it's
42:37 it's uh it can be violent at times
42:40 uh but very effective and so i i think
42:44 um using that platform initially was
42:47 a great way to get out the message as
42:50 quickly as possible to the broadest
42:51 audience
42:52 um you know in in a fairly effective way
42:55 now hindsight being 2020 42:57 uh could we have done things differently
42:59 well sure
43:00 hindsight's always 20 20 right i'm sure
43:02 there's things we do in our daily lives
43:03 that
43:03 we probably look back and say well i
43:05 wish i had done that a little bit
43:06 differently
43:07 but for the most part i feel very
43:10 satisfied
43:11 that we were able to accomplish much of
43:13 what we set out to do with ttsa
43:15 now what about the uh
43:18 not necessarily the investors
43:21 that that purchased you know stock
43:23 options into
43:25 ttsa but the original presentations
43:28 uh that you were part of uh back in 2017 43:32 with the talk of and advancing the
43:34 technology bringing it into the civilian
43:37 sector
43:38 you're going to have a technology
43:39 division of course steve justice was a
43:41 part of that
43:42 and and that part of it which was
43:46 uh another pillar of ttsa what what
43:49 happens
43:49 what happens with that angle well it's
43:52 still there and it's still evolving
43:54 we still have the creative uh which is
43:55 the research agreement with the us
43:57 government
43:57 we still have uh capabilities such as
44:00 the adam project and the vault and scout
44:02 uh and and other efforts such as the the
44:06 payton project which is working with the
44:08 first nations of saskatchewan trying to
44:10 record the oral traditions of indigenous
44:12 indigenous people so those those efforts
44:15 are still very much alive
44:17 and we are actually currently right now
44:19 as as we speak believe it or not working
44:22 on furthering those efforts um they're
44:25 they're certainly not dead in the water
44:26 it's like any time you shift gears right
44:29 there's a transition
44:30 involved in that and we're now looking
44:33 at a
44:34 at the most effective way to to
44:37 succeed in those areas now the
44:41 uh ttsa website um
44:44 uh has has been scrubbed
44:47 you're no longer there um along with
44:50 chris mellon of course chief justice
44:51 it has the finality of that set
44:54 in and and you know because it's
44:58 been a part of your life for the last
45:00 three years and to not see that i
45:02 expected it to still be there maybe it
45:04 wasn't updated yet
45:05 but but it was gone and has that sunk in
45:10 uh yeah sure i mean as a military person
45:12 you're used to
45:13 every three years having a new job
45:15 that's just kind of the way uniformed
45:17 services
45:18 go no one is assigned to a duty position
45:21 forever
45:22 there's there's a lot of turnover so for
45:25 me
45:25 um it it you know has it sunk in
45:30 yes but in a way because i'm still
45:32 friends with everybody there
45:34 it's literally just a phone call away i
45:36 i can every time i go to california i
45:38 can swing by and
45:39 go grab a cup of coffee with tom or
45:41 anybody else in the office
45:43 hal is still a very close friend of mine
45:45 i still maintain close communications
45:47 with jim semivan
45:48 so uh and of course all the advisors as
45:50 well such as dr norm khan et cetera
45:53 so my leaving the company
45:56 isn't what a lot of people think people
45:58 think oh they got disgruntled and there
46:00 was some big
46:00 fiasco inside that really wasn't the
46:03 case
46:04 um as far as the daily runnings of the
46:05 business i'm not a business guy to be
46:07 honest with you i couldn't tell you
46:09 anything about it
46:10 i know there were some people
46:11 specifically brought into ttsa to
46:14 manage the business portion i'm not a
46:16 business guy
46:17 i'm and frankly i'm not i'm not a i'm
46:19 not an entertainer either so
46:21 there really wasn't a super great fit
46:23 for me as you probably know a lot of
46:25 your listeners
46:26 the ttsa core mission has begin to lift
46:29 and shift
46:30 and to focus primarily on the
46:31 entertainment piece and i think that's
46:34 that's probably prudent because it gives
46:36 you probably a better chance of
46:38 near-term investment return on
46:39 investment for those people who have
46:41 who have contributed money and invested
46:44 in ttsa
46:45 so that's probably a prudent idea um
46:49 again forgive me because i i don't i
46:51 really don't have the authority to speak
46:52 on behalf of ttsa
46:54 hey i'm not an employee i just i wasn't
46:56 in the business process
46:57 uh of of the daily you know daily
47:00 activities of the company
47:02 but i do know that the the emphasis was
47:04 to start focusing on a
47:06 on a more immediate return on investment
47:08 for for for those investors that are out
47:10 there
47:10 now uh very early on the
47:14 uh the message that was being pushed out
47:18 uh through various media organizations
47:22 by ttsa
47:23 was using the word threat
47:27 and i think that the perception uh
47:30 by anybody not only the ufo community
47:34 but anybody
47:35 reading this outside of the ufo
47:37 community uh
47:38 sees threat equates that with fear
47:41 and that was the totality of the message
47:45 coming out of ttsa
47:47 were you concerned about that well sure
47:50 but let's not forget where where
47:52 i come from i come from the the national
47:54 security apparatus of our country
47:56 being part of the intelligence community
47:58 and department of defense
48:00 there's always a potential threat
48:02 narrative otherwise
48:03 you know put this over to epa or you
48:05 know department of interior or some
48:07 other organization to handle or
48:09 or you know health and human services or
48:11 even nasa
48:12 the fact that it's in department of
48:14 defense the word defense
48:16 is in its very title um the job with the
48:19 department of defense is to go and fight
48:21 and win wars
48:22 very quickly and and very efficiently um
48:25 it's not really to engage in
48:27 humanitarian assistance or anything like
48:29 that or ask the bigger questions
48:31 that frankly the scientific community
48:32 and academia is probably better postured
48:34 to answer such as
48:35 what are the intentions and where are
48:37 they from and all that we were looking
48:39 at two fundamental things
48:41 what is it and how does it work and from
48:44 a dod
48:44 perspective just take this for a moment
48:46 if you have something flying around
48:49 that you don't know what it is you don't
48:51 know how it works and there's not
48:52 frankly a damn thing you can do about it
48:54 is that a threat well from a national
48:57 national security perspective
48:59 it could be if it wanted to be let's
49:00 let's let's superimpose this idea if
49:03 these things happen to have
49:04 let's say uh a russian star on the tail
49:08 or a north korean tail number
49:09 and they were flying over our populated
49:11 cities what would happen
49:13 well we would scramble f-22s immediately
49:16 norad would be alerted and it'd be on
49:17 the front page of cnn and fox news
49:20 um that's that's the reality we don't
49:22 like things
49:23 into what we call air domain awareness
49:25 we don't like things
49:27 flying in our airspace that we don't
49:28 know what they are um so
49:30 yeah there's a potential threat there
49:32 i've often used and i'm gonna digress
49:34 here jimmy just for a second
49:36 uh it's it's a little bit of a
49:37 long-winded analogy but it might help
49:39 put things into perspective for some of
49:41 your your
49:42 your audience and i've said this analogy
49:45 before so forgive me if if it seems old
49:47 um but if i may ask jimmy don't you have
49:50 to be specific but
49:51 where do you live i live in burbank okay
49:54 burbank beautiful city
49:56 let me ask you at night do you lock the
49:58 front door
49:59 sometimes okay and i'm sure you live in
50:02 a great neighborhood you don't expect
50:04 anything bad to happen
50:05 so you lock that front door just to be
50:07 careful right
50:08 and you might even go the extra step
50:10 maybe you'll check once in a while
50:12 the windows the front windows make sure
50:13 they're secure and when you go to bed
50:15 you might even turn the alarm system on
50:17 just for extra precaution let's say one
50:20 morning you wake up and you come
50:21 downstairs
50:22 you're going to have a nice hot cup of
50:23 coffee or tea and you walk downstairs
50:25 and all of a sudden
50:27 there are muddy boot prints in your
50:28 living room now
50:30 no one's been hurt nothing's been taken
50:32 nothing's out of place
50:34 but despite you locking the front door
50:36 that night before and the windows and
50:38 turning on the alarm
50:39 there's now muddy boot prints that
50:41 weren't there the night before
50:42 my question to you and your audience is
50:45 is that a threat
50:46 and my response would be well it could
50:49 be if it wanted to be so we better
50:50 figure it out
50:51 and that's where that threat narrative
50:53 came from it's the fact that we
50:55 don't know what this is we in order to
50:57 determine what a threat is in
50:58 in government speak there's two pieces
51:00 of the equation you have to have
51:02 intent versus capabilities now we've
51:05 seen some of the capabilities
51:07 which are pretty incredible we have no
51:09 idea the intent
51:11 so therefore it's a big question mark we
51:13 can't say definitively that it is or it
51:16 is not
51:16 a threat so the prudent perspective to
51:19 have is that
51:20 well maybe we should try to figure it
51:22 out and and again not trying to fear
51:24 monger because i know there's a lot of
51:25 people out there that
51:26 consider themselves quote unquote
51:28 experiencers and they say oh no it's
51:30 great it's wonderful
51:31 but what about for those that it's not
51:33 so great and wonderful for those that
51:34 have reported terrifying incidents
51:36 for being taken a away against your own
51:39 volition
51:40 you know in in terms of of of an
51:43 investigator which is my background
51:45 if i take you somewhere and you call for
51:48 an uber and you want to go to the
51:49 airport
51:50 but in the meantime i go and i take i
51:52 take you to go pick up my clothes from
51:54 the laundry and then i go get pizza
51:57 whether it's a nice ride or not that's
51:58 called kidnapping that's a felony it's
52:00 illegal
52:01 because i'm taking you somewhere against
52:03 your free will
52:04 and god forbid if i even touch you
52:06 because i touch you now that's assault
52:08 right these are crimes and i understand
52:10 that people
52:11 get very emotional about the whole idea
52:13 about you know the threat narrative and
52:15 lou you're fear-mongering
52:17 no i'm not i've got two daughters and
52:19 i'll be damned if you know
52:21 i'm gonna i don't even trust their
52:22 boyfriend so
52:24 why in the hell would i trust something
52:25 that that i have
52:27 zero information on other than some of
52:30 the capabilities
52:31 that's that's just from my perspective
52:33 with my background
52:35 that's kind of my dna and that's kind of
52:37 the dna of the department of defense and
52:40 frankly
52:40 i would submit to you want them to be
52:42 that way you don't want them taking
52:44 chances just because
52:46 we don't know something i don't think i
52:49 think it's too early to make a
52:50 presumption one way or the other
52:52 i i think we need more data i think we
52:53 need more information in order that we
52:55 can make that determination
52:57 and then decide what we want to do as as
53:00 as a society as
53:01 a people as a country yeah i uh i'm a
53:04 military brat
53:05 my dad did 30 years in the army um i
53:08 lived on
53:08 uh bases all around the country all
53:10 around the world
53:12 and uh i totally respect uh the military
53:15 in the military life
53:17 it's it's it's an awesome experience uh
53:19 with that
53:20 but my dad never fired a gun he was band
53:23 leader in the army band
53:24 so let me just say that hey you know
53:27 what
53:28 he was smarter than me i i often thought
53:32 that he he kind of outsmarted everybody
53:34 on that one
53:34 um uh he didn't do anything after basic
53:37 training
53:38 but but that being said was there any
53:44 is the department of defense in any
53:46 branch
53:47 sitting on knowledge of of threats
53:51 has there been any hostile activity that
53:54 would warrant the threat narrative
53:57 so that's it grin great question jimmy
54:00 because
54:01 the term threat there can be something
54:04 like
54:05 in terms of a direct threat which we all
54:07 kind of imagine being like a foreign
54:08 adversarial threat
54:09 but then there's indirect threats um
54:12 another analogy i like to use
54:14 that you know they have a fence around
54:16 around the
54:17 tarmac of an airport so people don't get
54:19 too close
54:21 partly that is up there for your own
54:23 protection obviously if if i get too
54:25 close to a 747 about to take off
54:28 there's going to be injuries i'm going
54:31 to probably get burned i might go deaf
54:33 because of the
54:34 the sound and the acoustic uh if you
54:38 will signature
54:39 um that is a biological threat um
54:42 it may not be a purple intentful threat
54:45 by the aircraft to harm
54:47 me but it there's an environmental issue
54:49 there and so
54:50 i think a lot of people look and say
54:52 well was there any provocative action
54:55 by by one of these uaps well
54:58 that depends what is your definition of
55:00 provocative because
55:01 for me if if i'm flying an f-18 at
55:04 cruising altitude let's say at mach
55:07 1 and all of a sudden something is
55:10 approaching my aircraft
55:12 at a much greater speed and comes within
55:14 50 feet of my aircraft
55:15 well that's an air safety issue you know
55:17 that's not a direct threat in the way of
55:19 a hostility that this thing is trying to
55:21 shoot you or shoot you down
55:23 but there's still a threat to safety so
55:25 you know it's
55:27 as we unpackage this term threat
55:30 it's really not quite that simple
55:32 there's a lot of different
55:33 layers and strata to to that term threat
55:37 some of it is a direct some of it is
55:38 indirect some of it is unintentional
55:40 some of it may be intentional
55:41 um i think what you're asking me and
55:43 please correct me if i'm wrong
55:45 has there been any direct provocation by
55:48 a ufo uap
55:50 against a dod or a us government
55:54 equity is that correct yeah has anybody
55:55 shot at each other
55:57 have you seen any reports is is the
56:00 department of defense in any branch
56:03 sitting on this have you seen any of it
56:07 i have seen data that suggests that
56:10 they have uh these these uap have a
56:13 ability a direct ability to interfere
56:16 with our
56:17 nuclear strike capability uh both in
56:20 defense
56:21 and in in response to a a
56:24 a nuclear threat so for me
56:27 anything that has the ability to
56:29 interfere with that um
56:31 could be could be problematic um
56:34 put it this way if you and i were to go
56:36 walk onto uh
56:38 uh you know let's say oscar or november
56:40 site up in in
56:42 you know the part of my northern part of
56:45 montana
56:46 you and i would be quickly surrounded by
56:48 uh
56:49 people with a lot of machine guns and
56:51 probably
56:52 uh escorted away very quickly and
56:54 questioned quite rigorously right
56:56 because that's a potential threat
56:57 perceived threat to our national
56:59 uh capability response capability well
57:02 these things have the ability seemingly
57:04 to
57:05 fly over our area without impunity and
57:07 have the ability to interfere with our
57:09 capability and
57:11 if it's not scary enough that they have
57:13 the ability to take
57:14 our systems offline we have information
57:17 that over in russia
57:18 it actually uh interfered and brought
57:21 those
57:22 nuclear capabilities in russia online
57:25 so that's that's a whole
57:28 different equation now we're talking
57:30 about
57:31 um and i think i'll probably i'll leave
57:34 it at that
57:35 okay there you go we we need to take a a
57:37 quick break here
57:39 um and when we come back uh we'll
57:41 continue the conversation
57:43 except we're going to change a little

63:41 our conscious life expo 2021 special
63:44 preview event
63:46 and uh tonight it's all about lou though
63:48 and
63:49 a great conversation so far lou i want
63:51 to back up a little bit
63:53 and my concern has always been
63:56 the ufo community and and and what it
64:00 represents
64:01 and the the ignoring
64:05 of uh the ufo community uh by ttsa
64:10 for me uh raised a lot of red flags
64:13 is that something that you
64:17 would have done differently over the
64:19 last three years
64:21 yeah i think hindsight being 2020 as we
64:23 discussed uh
64:24 is the greatest teacher of all you know
64:26 i i
64:27 i have never been a ufo guy other than
64:30 working for the government i don't know
64:32 anything about ufology or ufologists
64:34 um it was a bit a bit of a baptism by
64:38 fire when i when i left the government
64:40 um my focus has always been i've always
64:43 maintained this
64:44 is is not the ufo community they have
64:46 champions they have people already
64:48 that have been engaging in this topic
64:50 such as yourself as you said for 50 64:52 years
64:52 right so i'm not going to change
64:54 anybody's opinion
64:56 my focus and the focus of chris mellon
64:58 has always been the other 99.9 65:01 of the population who's never really
65:03 even heard about ufos or
65:05 may have seen some sort of science
65:06 fiction movie as a kid but never really
65:09 paid attention to the topic because it
65:11 was typically associated as being a
65:12 fringe topic
65:14 a topic that is somewhat taboo a lot of
65:17 stigma associated with it
65:20 my my focus was never the ufo community
65:22 my focus was
65:23 was everybody else you know ufo
65:25 community has its champions
65:27 already and i there's there's nothing
65:29 that i'm going to do
65:31 or say or show that is going to change
65:34 the opinion or narrative of anybody in
65:36 the ufo community it's a very
65:38 it's a very emotionally charged
65:40 community
65:41 a lot of people have opinions it's like
65:44 politics and religion right i'm not
65:45 going to go into a catholic church
65:47 and try to convert anybody that's that
65:50 that's
65:50 foolish why would i do that you know
65:52 that's they already have their
65:53 their their organized structure if you
65:56 will and they're very happy with those
65:58 narratives
65:59 my my focus was trying to come in and
66:01 bring this topic
66:03 out of the out of this you know well
66:04 she's upon out of the shadows
66:06 and and really into the mainstream and
66:08 that includes media right so
66:11 having having major both liberal and
66:13 conservative media outlets
66:15 for the first time covering this and
66:17 it's not political suicide for them
66:19 right they're not chuckling and laughing
66:20 under their breath and
66:22 right you now have scientists and you
66:24 have harvard professors and you have
66:26 academics all coming forward now and
66:28 saying you know what
66:29 this is a serious topic and we need to
66:32 have conversation about it
66:33 now looking back could we have done
66:36 better with the ufo community
66:38 sure absolutely but but i was never in
66:41 the ufo community i wouldn't even know
66:42 where to begin that's
66:44 that's someone else's job let somebody
66:46 who knows that world
66:48 do that um you know i i have tried
66:51 very hard in the last few months since
66:53 i've left ttsa
66:54 to engage the ufo community the reason
66:58 for that
66:58 is because there's a tremendous amount
67:00 of talent i got to tell you jimmy
67:02 one of the most incredible tools i've i
67:04 have seen
67:06 that has been truly awe-inspiring has
67:08 been the emergence of this ufo twitter
67:12 this is a group of people who come from
67:14 all walks of life
67:15 all socio-economic backgrounds all race
67:18 color religions are there
67:20 and makes making this more exciting is
67:22 that you have actually senior members of
67:24 the government
67:25 that are actually now part of the
67:26 conversation and getting a pulse for
67:29 for this topic i mean how wonderful that
67:32 is
67:33 that we can finally have conversation
67:35 about this
67:36 in an elevated way even with other world
67:38 leaders japan just jumped on board with
67:40 the america
67:41 in a bilateral relationship information
67:43 sharing relationship about ufos
67:45 i mean jimmy i i don't know what to tell
67:48 you
67:48 that's that for me is is one hell of an
67:52 achievement and that's not an
67:53 achievement that
67:54 ptsa or myself or any single one person
67:57 or organization can take credit for
67:59 that's everybody's win that's your win
68:02 that's your audience's win that's our
68:03 win that's
68:04 the collective win of all of us
68:07 but let me jump in that's what tta
68:10 missed the boat on
68:13 all of that support all of it by saying
68:16 you know we don't care about the ufo
68:17 community they don't know what's going
68:19 on with them
68:20 that's not entirely true because let's
68:22 face it i the very first conference i
68:24 ever did was for mufon
68:26 and the second conference i ever did was
68:28 for the scu
68:29 so i mean it wasn't that i was
68:30 alienating or we were trying to alienate
68:33 anybody purposefully
68:34 but you know you had a small enclave of
68:37 people
68:38 sitting over here on the side called the
68:39 ufo community
68:41 and then you had this four and a half
68:43 billion other people
68:44 out there that's never even heard about
68:46 ufos or thought that they were
68:49 so yeah i agree with you 100 that
68:51 probably
68:52 you know looking back we could have done
68:54 a much better job engaging
68:57 um and i i you know i sincerely and
69:00 truly and humbly apologize for anybody
69:02 who may have felt they were left out
69:04 um at the time i did not control my own
69:06 media
69:07 um now i do and i think you're seeing a
69:10 lot more engagement
69:12 on behalf of chris and myself to engage
69:15 uh the community in this topic
69:17 um but yeah i mean we sure sure as hell
69:20 could have done a lot better job in the
69:21 in the early days um but you know you
69:24 don't know what you don't know and
69:25 and i think we're we're we're trying to
69:28 make up for some of that lost ground
69:30 perhaps at least that's what we're
69:31 trying to do now
69:32 uh thank you for that uh very early on
69:35 um as i looked at
69:39 um and i want you to really listen to
69:42 what i'm about to say but i looked at
69:45 the the staff at and
69:48 uh 10 or 12 uh that were listed on the
69:51 website
69:52 and uh 10 out of that 12 69:56 were from an agency right
69:59 okay so we're talking about the cia the
70:02 department of defense and
70:04 counterintelligence and
70:05 and so forth and you know from the top
70:07 down from semi-van down
70:09 um you had a medical uh brain specialist
70:13 from the cia
70:14 right okay and and i'm looking at that
70:16 and i'm thinking to myself
70:19 if my company my company my corporation
70:23 that i own had that same staffing
70:27 the hammer would come down on me from
70:30 the community
70:31 that this i can appreciate that jimmy
70:33 but let's face it your your industry is
70:35 full of experts in your field
70:37 you're you do a radio show and you have
70:39 you i'm sure
70:40 maybe i'm wrong but i'm sure you have uh
70:43 you know
70:43 media experts on your staff and editing
70:46 experts
70:46 and audio visual experts and all the
70:49 experts
70:50 you need to do your mission and from my
70:53 perspective let's not forget that atip
70:55 was an intelligent function at least
70:57 from the time i came in from 2008 until
71:00 the time i left in 2017 71:02 it still remains under the uap test
71:04 force an intelligence function
71:06 under the dod so naturally anybody who's
71:09 going to have any expertise or
71:11 experience in this within the government
71:13 comes from the intelligence community
71:14 and yeah i i know it's startling people
71:16 look at that and say hey what the hell
71:17 is going on here wait is this some sort
71:19 of
71:19 psychological operation being run
71:21 against us it's not it's just that
71:23 that's where the core density of
71:24 expertise lays
71:26 and it's you know had it been like i
71:28 said under the department of energy or
71:30 the department of interior or health and
71:32 human services
71:33 maybe we'd have a bunch of doctors
71:34 instead of spooks on on staff
71:37 and that's that's highly probable but
71:39 it's just the fact that the atip
71:41 was an intelligence capability and
71:43 remained within the intelligence
71:45 apparatus
71:46 i i don't think it's that much of a
71:48 stretch for people to recognize
71:50 that's where you're going to get that
71:51 expertise and the only way we're going
71:52 to break
71:53 down the barriers and the
71:55 misunderstanding and the mistrust is by
71:57 doing exactly this
71:58 having honest dialogue communication ask
72:01 us anything you want
72:02 can't say for them ask me anything you
72:04 want and i will do my honest very best
72:08 to tell you what i know as long as i
72:10 don't violate my security oath
72:12 or frankly i have the answer because
72:14 there's going to be some questions i'm
72:15 sure
72:15 that's frankly i don't know and i'll
72:17 tell you that so
72:18 that's that's why exactly why you see me
72:21 doing
72:22 shows like yours because we realize that
72:25 we have spent too long not explaining
72:28 our position
72:29 we probably could have done a better job
72:30 explaining our position earlier on
72:32 and demystifying a lot of this um
72:36 but you know yeah i get it well yeah you
72:38 know the you know the perception
72:40 uh you know it's always us and
72:43 not only the ufo community but the
72:45 united states uh citizens
72:47 it's us against them it's us against the
72:49 man it it will always be presented that
72:52 way
72:52 and when it comes to oh my fortune i
72:55 mean
72:55 you're right jimmy that's absolutely the
72:57 perception and and we see it all the
72:59 time on the nightly news
73:01 but please understand that 99.9 73:04 of the americans that work in the
73:05 government are just like you and me
73:08 they're patriots they have mortgages to
73:09 pay they love their children you know
73:11 they're not eating babies on the street
73:12 corner
73:13 you know they're fighting and winning
73:14 wars on our behalf they're just like
73:16 your father your father was in the army
73:18 that's exactly like everybody i've ever
73:20 run into into the pentagon they want to
73:22 do a good job
73:23 yeah they make mistakes yeah the system
73:26 fails sometimes because of the
73:27 bureaucracy
73:28 but but all in all it's filled with
73:31 really good people and i think when we
73:32 we make the mistake of saying
73:34 the government let's not forget the
73:37 government serves
73:38 us we the people not the other way
73:40 around if we have a problem with
73:42 government
73:43 then it's up to us to change it let's
73:45 stop bitching and sitting back on our
73:47 lawn chairs and saying i don't like the
73:48 man you don't like it vote somebody who
73:50 you do on in
73:52 well be quiet get dressed up and and
73:54 have have a conversation with somebody
73:56 and vote somebody in
73:57 that you do trust that will make the
73:58 changes that you want i don't disagree
74:00 with you
74:00 by the way jimmy i i understand the
74:02 perception
74:04 very well because i've lived it every
74:06 time i walk into a room
74:07 and i'm wearing a suit i can see people
74:09 scatter like like
74:10 like mice oh god here comes here comes
74:12 the spooks right um
74:14 but in reality it's you i think you're
74:17 giving us far too much credit
74:19 than we deserve well you don't you don't
74:20 look you don't look too
74:22 spookish by the way you've
74:24 [Laughter]
74:26 uh
74:31 there's the other side of this and and i
74:34 know you've heard it so let's address it
74:36 now
74:36 that that tom was
74:40 uh brought in because of his influence
74:44 in the entertainment world and was used
74:47 as as a front for a cia
74:50 operation to bring this info in
74:54 to the world and and it's kind of hard
74:56 to not have that argument is it
74:59 well let me ask you to what purpose why
75:01 would we spend millions of dollars
75:04 to run a campaign against the american
75:06 people
75:08 just to fool them is it is it just to
75:10 play a joke a funny joke and in 10 years
75:12 the truth comes out we say ha ha fooled
75:14 you guys
75:15 i mean that doesn't really make sense
75:17 that's that's not what we spent taxpayer
75:19 dollars on now i
75:20 understand that people make the claim
75:22 hey tom was brought in and frankly i
75:24 don't know the answer to that because i
75:25 wasn't part of ttsa back then
75:27 i wasn't one of the founding members so
75:29 i really don't know
75:31 if tom found the people or the people
75:33 found tom
75:34 i really don't know but at the end of
75:36 the day if we're getting disclosure
75:39 i'm good with it i really don't don't
75:40 care either way because
75:42 it's working um and if we happen by the
75:45 way just
75:45 just for argument's sake let's say we
75:47 did have some friends in the cia
75:49 that wanted to bring about disclosure
75:51 well you know what
75:52 thank you i'm i'm pretty happy with that
75:54 you know we're getting what we wanted
75:56 and people will say well you know it's a
75:57 psy up
75:58 or do i don't know i don't know what
76:00 else to say why
76:02 i mean i guess use common sense why
76:05 would we be doing this
76:08 just just to deceive americans my point
76:10 is there's
76:11 there's no reason to do it do i hide
76:13 super secret technology well
76:15 we do that all the time we have
76:16 technology that won't see the light of
76:18 day for the next 25 30 years
76:20 i don't need to have a public campaign
76:21 to deceive americans
76:23 i mean that's silly i'll just keep keep
76:24 my stuff at area 51 and you'll never see
76:26 it
76:27 so it go ahead okay well um
76:30 uh understood except there's always a
76:34 but right there's always about
76:35 but um the
76:39 the government washington dc in any form
76:43 has not been forthwith or honest about
76:47 what
76:48 they know or do not know about ufos
76:51 for at least 70 years and i agree
76:54 and i i agree with you jimmy 100 and now
76:57 and so that's
76:58 that is exactly why i am doing what i'm
77:00 doing
77:01 you're absolutely correct so today
77:04 why should we put our trust in the man
77:07 when
77:08 it has been the opposite for so long you
77:11 know
77:12 it's crazy yes you don't have to trust
77:15 the man
77:16 because we are getting the results we
77:18 collectively
77:19 the the community the ufo community ufo
77:22 twitter the
77:23 the american population we're getting
77:25 the answers we're getting our our senior
77:28 elected officials engaged or receiving
77:29 classified briefings about the reality
77:31 of these things
77:32 you have the establishment of a uap task
77:34 force you think the government
77:35 wants to go after this hell no this
77:37 thing is radioactive this is a
77:40 a traditionally a toxic portfolio for
77:43 anybody to manage
77:44 that they're they're doing this
77:46 begrudgingly so
77:48 you know i my response to that is you
77:50 know if you don't want to trust a man
77:52 then don't
77:53 but you're getting the results we when
77:56 you say the man you have to
77:58 look in the mirror because to some
77:59 degree we collectively are making this
78:02 happen
78:02 this is not the man just coming forward
78:04 and say hey let me fool the american
78:05 people and
78:06 and we're going to lay off disclosure no
78:08 it has been people don't realize the
78:10 sacrifice it took
78:11 to even get to where we are now i mean
78:14 it has been brutal i
78:15 i i will tell you i will talk about
78:18 myself the journey i've had to be on
78:20 but let me tell you there's a lot easier
78:22 ways to do a psychological operation
78:24 against a target then this way
78:26 if you ever were to do one this should
78:28 be the last way you'd ever want to do it
78:30 it's expensive
78:31 uh there's there's a lot of liability
78:35 a lot of exposure and there's too much
78:37 at risk
78:39 because if it ever got out that this
78:41 let's just say for argument's sake this
78:42 was some sort of psyop
78:44 you'd have to fire half of the executive
78:46 branch and bring them up on charges
78:48 probably of sedition to be honest with
78:49 you so
78:51 you know again i i would i would tell
78:54 people that if
78:55 if if you're if you're upset with with
78:57 the man and you think that this is
78:59 this is an effort by the man to to fool
79:01 you i would say look in the mirror
79:03 because
79:04 because you are the man every person out
79:08 there represents the man because
79:09 that is who who the government works for
79:12 and
79:13 again i know i get a little bit animated
79:14 when i say hey if you don't like the
79:16 government then get up and change it
79:18 but that's that's sincere i'm not just
79:20 saying that we ultimately
79:22 the failure and success of any
79:24 government is is a reflection on its
79:26 people
79:27 and we are the ones who make those
79:28 decisions not the government i wish
79:30 everybody could see
79:31 uh lou uh you can't but he's getting
79:34 very animated
79:36 the arms are fine
79:40 that's i've always that way i'd like to
79:41 read a quote to you real quick
79:43 a buddy of mine sent me a quote jimmy go
79:45 ahead and uh
79:47 and uh and talk but there's something i
79:49 want to share with you
79:50 and let me um okay while you're pulling
79:53 that up
79:54 here's here's the next question if we go
79:57 back
79:57 to um the live presentation
80:01 and the announcement of ttsa
80:04 you resigned i believe the day before
80:07 right and your
80:08 resignation letter um you can correct me
80:10 if i'm wrong but i think that's
80:11 how it went down and you resigned
80:15 and and went over to ttsa um
80:18 just recently the uap task force
80:21 is is put together and you leave
80:25 ttsa at the same time and that leaves me
80:29 backing up saying hmm
80:31 i think lou's got something to do with
80:33 the uap task force
80:35 this is beyond coincidence am i wrong
80:39 um no you're not wrong
80:41 [Laughter]
80:43 um you know i uh i i want to be careful
80:48 not to say too much it's still the uap
80:50 task force is in a bit of a
80:51 uh a delicate state right now um it
80:54 still needs to get on its feet
80:55 so i i don't want to say anything um
80:58 there's some
80:59 incredible fine men and women in that
81:01 organization right now
81:02 uh who are friends of mine who are
81:04 frankly on the a-tip journey with me and
81:06 so
81:06 um you know much of the credit really
81:10 belongs to them
81:11 okay well the answer is yes okay what
81:14 what's the quote you wanted to read to
81:16 us
81:16 so this is a quote from george
81:18 washington it's not very long it says
81:20 government is not reason it is not
81:23 eloquent
81:24 it is force like fire it is a dangerous
81:27 servant
81:27 and a fearful master experience has
81:30 taught us
81:31 that it is much easier to prevent an
81:33 enemy from posting themselves
81:35 than it is to dislodge them after they
81:38 have got possession
81:39 and when the freedom of speech is taken
81:41 away
81:42 then dumb and silent we may be led
81:46 like sheep to the slaughter that was
81:48 george washington
81:49 and so there is a natural distrust
81:54 with government uh that has that has
81:56 been around forever this is not just a
81:58 ufo
81:59 thing that the ufo community has
82:01 experienced that was said by george
82:03 washington
82:04 who you know was was one of the founding
82:06 fathers of this of this great nation so
82:09 i think healthy distrust is okay
82:12 where i draw the line is paranoia
82:15 distrust right
82:17 that's why we have checks and balances
82:19 we always want to make sure
82:20 we want to mind the minders so to speak
82:23 and that's really up to the people to do
82:24 uh you know your show is a perfect
82:26 example of that you know you
82:28 your your job is to call out uh
82:31 something when you see there is some
82:33 sort of malfeasance or some sort of
82:35 injustice
82:36 in whatever it is you're the show you're
82:38 doing um
82:40 that's precisely what we should be doing
82:41 that that that is exactly our job as the
82:43 people
82:44 to make sure the people that are
82:45 governed we we
82:47 govern the government that's how it
82:49 should be and so that's why when
82:51 when i talk to people with my
82:52 counterintelligence background
82:54 um you know my my first thing
82:57 that i say back to them is you know if
82:59 you distrust the government then change
83:01 that
83:02 because the government is is a
83:03 reflection of you um
83:05 and and it's you know it's not that hard
83:07 to do just get up and vote for somebody
83:09 it's you know or join the government
83:11 yourself and make the changes yourself
83:13 now uh i want to talk about susan galf
83:15 of for a second
83:17 uh you knew this was going to come up at
83:18 some point tonight
83:21 so much so much with susan could be
83:23 discussed but
83:24 but there was one point um
83:28 that she addressed more than once
83:32 and that was you and atip had nothing to
83:36 do
83:36 with each other and she drove that point
83:39 home
83:40 let's talk about that for a second well
83:43 first of all she said that
83:44 she said that a tip had nothing to do
83:46 with ufos right so
83:48 well like i said there there's many
83:50 things we can talk about with susan
83:52 a lot of layers and look i i
83:55 these people come and go uh dana white
83:57 already confirmed who i was where i
83:59 worked so did senator harry reid
84:01 senator bob bigelow so did hal put off
84:04 there's a document from 2009 from the
84:07 senate with my name on it for a tip it
84:08 says in black and white a tip it says
84:11 part of the read on for this program and
84:12 i was a senior civilian at the time so
84:14 the documentation is there there's
84:16 there's there's right now a lot of folks
84:18 in the media that actually have emails
84:19 they've been able to get the freedom of
84:20 information act
84:21 there was actually an air force osi
84:23 investigation that said you know lou
84:24 elizondo was
84:26 being the director of atip when they
84:27 tried to investigate me to see if i did
84:29 any type of malfeasance
84:31 the answer was the result was no i
84:32 didn't do anything wrong but in there it
84:34 says specifically that elizondo was
84:36 was you know discussing about the a-tip
84:38 program the ufo program when he was part
84:40 of it so
84:41 the long story short i'm going to save
84:42 you a whole long
84:44 you know discussion about it but i
84:48 i'm confident with myself again i don't
84:50 i don't really give a damn what people
84:51 think about me that's that's not why i'm
84:53 doing this i could have saved my
84:55 three years ago people now the
84:57 information that's coming forward
84:59 you know i i could have done three years
85:01 ago but i would have done it at the
85:02 expense of people on the inside and i'm
85:04 not that kind of guy i am not going to
85:06 throw somebody under the bus
85:07 or expose somebody just to save my own
85:10 credibility or save my own ass
85:11 so um if people are expecting that from
85:14 me
85:15 uh they're gonna wait a really long time
85:17 there's enough substantial information
85:19 out there dana white
85:20 already confirmed it uh and then you
85:23 have this susan go who comes in
85:25 and frankly excuse my language but
85:26 doesn't know her ass from a hole in the
85:28 ground
85:29 i don't know where she's getting fed
85:31 this information
85:32 uh because one day she says atip has
85:34 nothing to do with ufos and it comes
85:36 back and says oh yes it does and
85:38 before that i think they said well it
85:39 was advanced aviation when it was and it
85:41 was always advanced aerospace
85:43 the number of times that they have
85:44 flip-flopped back and forth at this
85:46 point even more important there's
85:48 there's a
85:48 and i won't say who it is but there's a
85:50 reporter that recently got an email
85:52 where they said well what does it matter
85:53 what lou did anyways because that was
85:55 three years ago
85:56 basically trying to pass a buck so um
85:58 you know
85:59 if anybody wants to know what i did i i
86:02 i highly doubt that that
86:04 the committees on the hill would ever
86:05 let me in and i'd still have a security
86:07 clearance to brief about atip
86:09 if i was never part of the program right
86:10 and it wasn't about ufos i mean
86:12 that's just common sense and my current
86:15 involvement with individuals
86:17 uh that were part of that program i mean
86:19 it
86:20 at this point you'd have to do such
86:23 mental gymnastics
86:24 to try to explain that away i wouldn't
86:26 even know where to start so
86:28 uh my my bigger concern on this whole
86:30 issue that's that's
86:31 not about me is the fact that the
86:33 department of defense
86:34 still can't get their story straight
86:36 that for me is a problem because it's
86:38 either a willful
86:39 and if it's willful we got a problem
86:41 right or it's
86:43 pure dysfunction and if it's dysfunction
86:45 we still got a problem
86:46 right so either way that needs to be
86:49 fixed
86:50 so either fire the people that are in
86:52 there now that are not doing their job
86:53 or don't know how to do it
86:54 or you get somebody to come in from down
86:56 above and shake them and say
86:58 stop doing that stop playing games
87:00 because all you're doing is sewing the
87:02 seat of distrust with the american
87:03 people
87:04 you're actually breaking down the
87:06 credibility and authority of the
87:07 department of defense when you do that
87:09 when you have a
87:10 a senator the senior senator of our
87:12 country come out and say
87:13 hi i mean i don't know what else you
87:15 need he was the guy who started this
87:17 program to begin with
87:19 but again jimmy this conversation
87:21 shouldn't be about me this is
87:23 this is precisely part of the problem we
87:25 should be talking about the big issue
87:27 here
87:27 about ufo disclosure otherwise you know
87:30 i'll start my own radio show and i'll
87:32 make it all about me
87:34 that's not what what that's not why i
87:36 got into this and i knew
87:38 going in that i was going to face a
87:40 tremendous
87:41 amount of pushback i knew this was going
87:44 to happen in fact i stated it very
87:45 clearly
87:46 i think it was maybe even at the mufon
87:48 um several years ago i said here's
87:50 what's going to happen
87:51 first of all uh they're going to admit
87:54 yes
87:54 and then they're going to realize what
87:56 they just did and they're going to come
87:57 back and
87:58 they're going to deny it and then when
88:00 they can't deny it they're gonna make
88:01 counter accusations against me and then
88:03 when they can't do that
88:04 they're gonna try to ignore it and all
88:06 these things have exactly played out

93:24 go and do it now our guest tonight lou
93:26 elizondo
93:28 and uh okay lou help help me understand
93:31 i'm so fascinated with this when the
93:34 announcement
93:35 uh it came december 17th in the new york
93:38 times 2017 93:39 about you know the secret ufo program uh
93:42 at the pentagon
93:44 i'm picturing in my mind
93:47 offices in the e-wing right in the
93:50 e-ring
93:52 it was actually the c-ring but but okay
93:54 okay so far
93:55 okay okay so you did have offices
93:58 in the pentagon yeah absolutely in in
94:01 the c-ring
94:02 and and how did that how did that how
94:04 did that go down
94:05 um would you have uh
94:08 different uh incident reports come in
94:12 uh the door uh you know how how did that
94:15 happen in
94:16 and yeah and how many investigators were
94:19 were working under you to do these
94:22 investigations
94:23 sure well i prefer to say with me um
94:25 anybody who's ever worked with me
94:27 knows that i run a very flat
94:28 organization we're a team um
94:30 so even though i was the senior guy and
94:33 technically in charge
94:35 we really made decisions collectively
94:36 they were it was it was really a mutual
94:39 effort
94:39 and think of an onion you have a at the
94:41 very center of the onion you have your
94:42 core group of people
94:44 uh that are part of your organization
94:46 and your effort and then as you go out
94:48 in these layers
94:49 uh subsequent layers of the onion you
94:51 have support mechanisms you have people
94:53 in different agencies that have certain
94:55 amount of expertise and they might help
94:56 you on this particular aspect or that
94:58 particular aspect for example analyzing
95:00 uh photographic evidence and
95:02 and videos or taking reports from their
95:05 organization and getting it to you
95:07 you ask the question of how do we get
95:09 information well
95:10 the answer is not so simple we got it
95:13 through
95:13 multiple different ways anybody who's
95:15 ever spent time in the government you
95:17 know you have these these
95:18 systems for to communicate back and
95:20 forth from the headquarters out to the
95:22 field
95:22 and some of these are unclassified
95:24 systems some of these are classified
95:25 networks
95:26 and it depended really at
95:29 where we were getting the information
95:31 from uh for example
95:32 um and i'm gonna say this uh in very
95:35 vague terms i don't want anybody to say
95:36 oh that's that's how it happened
95:37 this is just an example you might get an
95:39 email coming in
95:41 uh on a on a on a secure network from
95:44 let's say the captain of a ship
95:45 and uh the email says something to the
95:48 effect of hey
95:49 um you know we're seeing some pretty
95:51 weird stuff out here some pretty strange
95:52 lights
95:53 and we would really like your assistance
95:56 on this we have some aircraft that took
95:57 some footage
95:58 we have a couple pilots that had eyes
96:00 down on it we got some radar tracks
96:02 and then of course you would send out
96:04 the team or ask them to send you the
96:06 information depending on what
96:07 logistically
96:08 was was um was more feasible right
96:12 and so these this information would get
96:15 collected and collated
96:16 and then brought up to us where we would
96:19 analyze it we would look at it and then
96:20 if we had followed questions we could do
96:22 that
96:23 if we had to interview people we would
96:24 do that um i'm i have got to be very
96:27 careful
96:27 here and not say who and how because
96:31 those mechanisms i suspect are still
96:32 being used by the task force today
96:35 so i don't want to compromise those uh
96:37 but it's really no different than
96:39 than you'd expect in any other type of
96:41 activity at the pentagon
96:42 right so you have information coming in
96:45 you have
96:45 direction going out and then you have
96:48 briefings being
96:49 uh generated and then provided up to
96:51 senior level management in this
96:53 particular case
96:54 very senior level management so there
96:56 was
96:57 uh an office door
97:01 with a tip on the outside of the office
97:03 door no
97:04 absolutely not so i i had two
97:06 responsibilities in the pentagon
97:08 um i i often tell people um that
97:12 in our generation you remember the life
97:14 cereal commercial mikey
97:15 the kid that they did oh we don't like
97:17 this here give it to mikey he'll eat
97:18 anything
97:19 that was kind of my job they gave me
97:20 every every crappy portfolio
97:23 that nobody ever wanted to handle
97:25 somehow it just found its way to me
97:27 so at the time i was the director of
97:29 national programs special management
97:31 staff
97:32 and i had one court mission for for the
97:35 ousdi
97:36 and then under the secretary of defense
97:39 and his staff
97:40 osd staff i had the other mission i had
97:42 the a-tip mission
97:44 uh there was not even for my primary
97:45 portfolio my other portfolio there was
97:47 never a sign on the door
97:49 that said director national program
97:50 special management staff or
97:52 you know atip or guantanamo bay or
97:55 anything like that
97:56 that's not really how the pentagon works
97:59 you have
98:00 numbers uh that will tell you the office
98:03 and then usually you'll get some sort of
98:04 cryptic message
98:05 hey we've got a meeting in uh two bravo
98:09 uh three three five alpha and
98:13 if you know how the pentagon works then
98:15 okay i've got a meeting on
98:17 you know in this particular office and
98:18 you go to that office and it's just
98:19 literally a number on a door
98:21 usually with a big heavy vault lock on
98:23 it you knock you come in
98:25 they check your badge make sure you have
98:26 the security clearance and then you
98:27 might walk into another room
98:29 that's even a another what we call a
98:32 vault a vault within a skiff
98:34 uh and and that's where you do your
98:35 business
98:37 um were you known as uh
98:40 in a joking way like the ufo guys you
98:43 know what was the chatter
98:45 at the pentagon you know that door
98:47 that's the fox mulder group
98:49 there there were a few people especially
98:52 even within my staff that would chuckle
98:54 um uh there is i'm not going to say
98:56 which you can probably fill in the
98:58 blanks
98:59 but as a joke they had there's a very
99:02 popular
99:03 uh program about uh ufos particularly
99:07 aliens and the history as it might uh
99:10 relate
99:11 to humankind you can fill in the
99:12 delinquent show i'm talking about right
99:14 on
99:14 a major network and one of the hosts uh
99:17 is is very well known for
99:19 for um a very unique hairstyle
99:23 and uh there's there was a picture of
99:25 that
99:26 always placed in my office as a joke by
99:29 some of my folks
99:30 um as kind of a wink-wink nudge nudge
99:33 you know a little bit of ribbing
99:34 uh healthy ribbing uh that you'd expect
99:36 in a military environment right
99:38 um i can get that signed for you
99:42 if you would like it i can get that
99:45 signed for you
99:49 the the other part of it is
99:52 the atip investigations and then
99:56 when ttsa started of course we have you
99:59 know the nimitz and the roosevelt
100:01 and and that was that part of
100:05 the atip investigations going on at the
100:07 pentagon
100:09 and b case two-part question
100:13 why did that pentagon information stop
100:16 with the nimitz and roosevelt why
100:19 weren't you able to pull in
100:21 more atip investigations that were going
100:23 on
100:24 at the pentagon well i didn't pull them
100:27 out the media did
100:29 so kudos to the media you know and i
100:32 suspect that the media is going to be
100:33 successful in the future pulling out
100:34 more um
100:36 this is an evolving story obviously we
100:37 didn't just look at the nimitz and stop
100:39 at the roosevelt
100:40 this was an evolving effort there were
100:42 many many instances that were
100:44 recorded and reported about um
100:48 okay so my question is uh just for
100:50 clarification
100:52 uh the nimitz and roosevelt were part of
100:55 the atip investigations correct
100:57 absolutely unequivocally yes
100:59 and then the the other investigations
101:02 that atip was working
101:04 on that we haven't seen was there a
101:07 conscious decision not to pull that
101:09 stuff forward or did you not have that
101:11 data
101:12 available to you well uh
101:15 you know you have to be careful because
101:18 a lot of that stuff is is extremely
101:20 classified
101:21 um you know some the nimitz was
101:23 historical that the
101:24 the the video had already been uh
101:28 been leaked some time ago and it was
101:31 unclassified information residing on a
101:33 classified system so
101:34 that's fairly easy to dislodge and get
101:37 the approvals
101:38 for for for unlimited distribution
101:40 through
101:41 through the process uh which is the
101:43 dobson process but
101:45 there's other stuff that has where the
101:47 metadata uh
101:48 on the video or the photographs is uh
101:51 far more sensitive
101:52 certainly very classified you classify
101:55 something to do
101:56 for two reasons to protect sources and
101:58 methods
101:59 and uh the nature of those videos
102:02 uh were very very sensitive and by the
102:05 way it's not just what you're seeing
102:06 on the video it's where the video was
102:08 taken under what circumstances was taken
102:10 the audio that's on the video right so
102:13 there's a lot of stuff there um that's
102:15 in videos
102:16 that is really hard to clean up if you
102:19 wanted
102:19 to get that released from you know let's
102:21 say a top secret level
102:23 all the way down to an unlimited release
102:25 at the unclassified level that's
102:28 that's a you know that's a pretty
102:30 difficult
102:31 effort to do because you have to go
102:32 through and i'm not going to waste your
102:33 time with details but
102:34 you got to go through the original
102:35 classification authority for approval
102:37 for example the oca and then you have to
102:38 get forward disclosure approval and
102:40 you've got to go to
102:41 dobson you've got there's all these
102:43 little hoops you have to do the higher
102:44 classification
102:45 information is and data the more hoops
102:48 you have to jump through
102:49 to try to get that information released
102:51 did you see
102:53 um video evidence
102:56 uh while at atip that
103:00 freaked you out and what i mean by that
103:03 uh not not the nimitz videos that's that
103:06 stuff's not freak out material
103:07 it's it's not did you see
103:10 a black triangle did you see something
103:13 close up did you see something that you
103:14 could classify as a
103:16 classic flying saucer things that
103:19 the the public has never seen
103:23 absolutely and i'm not going to go
103:25 further than that absolutely that is the
103:27 reason why i am so compelled
103:29 to do what i'm doing i know what i've
103:31 seen
103:32 i know others have seen it as well and
103:34 that's why when the when the congress
103:36 people go into these briefings and
103:37 they're kind of like yeah i'm going to
103:38 go take a briefing
103:39 and they come out they say holy cow we
103:41 got to take this seriously they're not
103:43 looking at
103:44 at a grain grainy video taken
103:47 during the nimitz cruise they're looking
103:50 at
103:51 and information that is very classified
103:54 with a much greater degree of fidelity
103:56 that allows them to then make that
103:58 decision by the way at a unanimous level
104:00 they've all come out saying
104:02 holy smokes we need to look at this and
104:04 some of you have come out and said
104:06 this ain't ours you know that these are
104:08 pretty bold statements coming from your
104:10 elected officials
104:11 whereas two years ago they would have
104:13 laughed you wouldn't even take an
104:14 audience with you they'd have laughed
104:15 you right out of the room
104:16 and now they're having a very sober
104:18 conversation about this you
104:19 you have a task force that has been
104:21 established under
104:23 no other person than the deputy
104:24 secretary of defense himself
104:27 the deceptive and by the way now there's
104:29 a report due to congress and i think 144 104:32 143 days
104:34 from none other than the dni the
104:36 director of national intelligence
104:38 basically all 17 intelligence well now
104:40 18 104:41 intelligence organizations fall under
104:43 that one person the dni
104:45 and that is the person responsible for
104:47 putting this report together for
104:48 congress so
104:49 so you tell me do you think that
104:52 three fuzzy videos uh can get congress
104:55 to do what it did
104:57 probably not probably not are you
104:59 suggesting
105:01 uh suggesting i'm saying suggesting
105:04 are you suggesting that marco rubio
105:08 has seen a black triangle crystal clear
105:11 high def video i am absolutely not going
105:14 to speak for
105:15 for senator marco rubio um i respect him
105:18 tremendously
105:19 for coming out and having this
105:21 conversation and proving this is truly
105:24 a a a bipartisan issue because you had
105:26 senator harry reid
105:28 but most people forget that you also had
105:30 senator stevens and inua
105:31 and john glenn behind this effort right
105:34 uh you have
105:35 other senators and congressmen who've
105:37 come out and said hey
105:38 we need this briefing too and now you
105:40 have senator marco rubio from from my
105:42 home state
105:43 coming out and saying yeah this is
105:45 important we need to figure this out i
105:47 mean that
105:48 that is a hell of a brave position to
105:51 take
105:52 as a senator um you know that that takes
105:55 a lot of hubspot to be honest with you
105:57 and uh i i think that should be an
105:59 indicator of the level of briefing that
106:01 they're receiving in the information
106:03 yeah it wouldn't be the tic tac video uh
106:05 to get him to do this
106:07 i i'm i'm i'm fairly confident
106:10 in in saying that and then we have
106:13 uh the very curious quote
106:16 from dr eric davis um and
106:20 you know where i'm going with this but
106:22 he uh in the
106:24 the last new york times article by
106:26 leslie kane and and ralph
106:28 blumenthal very excellent but it at the
106:31 bottom
106:31 there's this little quote from dr eric
106:33 davis saying
106:35 that he briefed the senate and told them
106:38 that we are in possession of flying
106:41 saucers
106:42 right now you can't there's no way to
106:45 read between the lines on this it was a
106:47 very clear quote
106:49 and the new york times had to vet the
106:52 quote they're not going to put that in
106:54 the new york times without having
106:56 something sourced there they were
106:58 comfortable with it correct
107:00 um what's eric davis talking about
107:03 well i'd have to defer to my friend eric
107:06 davis um
107:07 you know uh he said what he said um
107:11 you know he uh if you know eric davis
107:14 you'll realize that he's got a really
107:16 interesting personality trait
107:18 he's one of the few people i often joke
107:20 on the planet that can't lie
107:22 um there's literally there's a quirk
107:24 there in the personality that
107:26 that the guy i think you could put like
107:28 i've said before you could put a knife
107:29 to the guy's throat
107:30 and he's gonna die because the guy you
107:32 could try to force him to lie and he
107:33 just
107:34 he can't do it um so uh
107:38 i've had the honor and privilege to to
107:40 work both directly and indirectly with
107:42 with eric
107:43 um he is a man of uh utmost
107:46 um credibility and he has served this
107:49 nation
107:50 honorably there are things that he has
107:52 done for this nation
107:53 that he will never take credit for but
107:55 i've seen the reporting and know exactly
107:56 what he's done
107:58 uh and he's a true asset to our nation
108:00 and so when he tells you
108:02 that he has done something i would take
108:04 that to the bank
108:05 why why this i just want your opinion on
108:09 this
108:10 why hasn't a journalist out there a
108:12 reporter
108:14 seized on that quote it may be the most
108:17 incredible quote in human history
108:19 if we really take it at at face value
108:22 why hasn't anybody taken this a step
108:25 further it's extraordinary information
108:29 well i mean don't look now jimmy but you
108:30 are
108:32 you're taking it forward you just you
108:33 just asked me that question
108:35 in front of who knows how many members
108:38 in your audience are listening
108:39 uh you just laid down the gauntlet so i
108:42 don't know why
108:43 why let me turn the tables and ask you
108:45 jimmy i mean you're a guy in the media
108:47 why
108:48 why haven't you asked this question
108:49 before i think it's a great question
108:51 yeah i i i have i've made statements
108:54 over the years
108:55 uh i i have a large audience both here
108:58 and
108:58 and over at coast to coast i've said
109:00 some extraordinary things
109:02 i didn't get anything from the media
109:05 i've always found that very
109:07 very interesting and i i don't know why
109:09 um
109:10 but to take this question one step
109:12 further
109:14 blue elizondo is our government in
109:17 possession of
109:18 crashed retrieved
109:21 landed traded flying saucers and
109:25 technology not of this earth
109:29 i can't answer that question as stated
109:32 um if you want to rephrase the question
109:34 i will do my best
109:36 to to provide you an answer but as
109:38 stated i cannot answer that question
109:40 the uh are we in possession of a flying
109:44 saucer
109:45 our government um let me let me say this
109:49 let me put it this way
109:51 it is my personal belief that
109:54 we are in possession of um
109:58 tangible evidence
110:02 call it material call it whatever you
110:03 want uh and that is all i'm prepared to
110:06 say
110:07 uh at this time well i have to be very
110:10 very careful not to cross the line i
110:12 know people want to know if
110:13 understand people say oh well you keep
110:15 hiding behind your nda as
110:16 an excuse no i'm not actually i don't
110:18 want to go to jail frankly
110:19 and second of all i don't want to betray
110:21 the trusted american people
110:23 i have a security clearance which isn't
110:24 just given from the government
110:26 it is it is it has been entrusted upon
110:28 me by the american people
110:29 and i'm not going to betray that just to
110:32 go ahead
110:33 and and get up get a few likes if you
110:36 will on twitter
110:37 i take that seriously and when i'm
110:40 finally relieved of that or the
110:41 information becomes officially
110:43 declassified then i will talk
110:44 all day about it but until that time
110:47 comes i have to be very very careful
110:49 very mindful
110:50 of everything i say and i don't want to
110:53 jeopardize
110:55 the momentum we have gained over the
110:57 last three years
110:58 by saying something that
111:02 has the potential to to um
111:06 halt stop hinder the
111:09 the progress that we're making if you
111:11 were in possession
111:13 of uh the video
111:16 documents the smoking gun and files
111:20 would you uh take the path of edward
111:23 snowden would you be a martyr
111:25 would you present the information wasn't
111:28 a martyr
111:29 but yeah but you understand the the
111:32 the way that i'm from the traitor what i
111:34 i do i just said what you're saying but
111:35 but
111:36 but let me be clear snowden was a leaker
111:38 and he was he was a traitor he wasn't a
111:40 martyr
111:40 um even though he he he provided
111:42 information that provided us insight on
111:44 things that were happening to include
111:45 fisa that's not the right way to go
111:48 about making an issue
111:50 you don't you don't reveal your
111:51 information all you have in your dirty
111:53 laundry to your enemy that's that's
111:55 the wrong approach to take if i had was
111:58 in possession of those videos i would do
111:59 exactly what i'm doing right now
112:01 continue to push the system to do what
112:04 is intended to do
112:05 it is not up to me luis alizando to tell
112:08 the world
112:09 everything you know about ufos it's up
112:11 to the world to then pressure congress
112:13 to enable congress to then pressure the
112:14 executive department
112:16 to do what to to provide what they know
112:18 about ufos
112:19 that's what needs to happen otherwise
112:22 you know i become this
112:23 this this demigod of a personality and
112:27 that's not what this is about this
112:29 this journey cannot be about any one
112:30 single person it definitely cannot be
112:32 just about me
112:33 it has to be about the collective will
112:35 of the people and this is what i keep
112:37 trying to drive home
112:38 it is up to the government to work the
112:41 way
112:41 it was intended to do and then provide
112:44 us the information
112:45 that we are seeking it is not up to luis
112:48 elizondo or chris mellon or tom delong
112:50 or anybody else or jimmy church
112:52 to do that it is up to our government
112:54 and so we have to do our best to enable
112:56 our government to
112:58 to function the way we expect it to
113:01 function look in 144 days
113:02 a report is due to congress whether we
113:05 like it or not now maybe it will ask for
113:06 an extension who knows
113:08 but the last thing you want to do is
113:10 provide congress some half-baked report
113:12 that doesn't have all the information in
113:13 there that by the way frankly they
113:15 deserve to have
113:16 right that's how you make the system
113:18 work by
113:19 by by getting the information to the
113:21 right people at the right time so they
113:23 can make the right decisions
113:25 so that's that's what i would do no i
113:27 would not repeat
113:28 anything that edward snowden or manning
113:30 did uh
113:31 i i find it absolutely reprehensible and
113:34 despicable
113:35 uh i know there's a lot of people out
113:36 there that may chew on me for that
113:38 but um you know i i don't ever ever
113:41 think there's a time to betray your
113:42 country
113:43 ever what do you expect to be in that
113:45 report
113:46 and and before you answer it it's very
113:49 interesting in the wording
113:50 uh there that there is the public
113:53 section
113:54 and then they are reserving a classified
113:57 section in the report is that an out
114:00 not to reveal anything or you know the
114:03 juicy stuff
114:04 what do you expect in the public side of
114:06 that report
114:08 well look there's been reports before
114:10 national intelligence estimates where we
114:12 talk about
114:12 north korean nuclear capability and
114:14 there's a lot of information that gets
114:16 out into the public sector that's
114:18 unclassified that's still very
114:19 meaningful that's
114:20 quote-unquote juicy you know i i think
114:23 we sometimes confuse classified
114:25 information with being juicy
114:26 that's not always the case a lot of
114:28 classified information is actually very
114:29 dull and boring
114:30 it's just extremely technical and so i
114:33 think what you might see
114:34 in the classified portion is that part
114:37 of the data that
114:38 involves specific sensor units specific
114:41 locations specific times specific call
114:43 signs
114:44 specific capabilities that is all very
114:48 sensitive information that you don't
114:49 necessarily want to getting out to the
114:50 public
114:51 not because we don't trust the american
114:52 people but there's no way to tell the
114:54 american people
114:55 and not have our foreign adversaries
114:58 also informed
114:59 so there is a there is a deliberate
115:03 effort by the government to safeguard
115:06 this information which i think they
115:07 should
115:08 and then that information which does not
115:10 need to be classified which by the way
115:12 people don't realize there's actually
115:13 rules
115:14 and regulations that prohibit the the
115:16 the
115:18 indiscriminate classification of
115:19 information you can't do it you have to
115:21 you have to follow very specific
115:22 guidelines
115:23 for that to be classified i don't
115:25 anticipate you're going to have in one
115:27 one report a a response to the american
115:30 people saying nothing to see here folks
115:31 and then in a classified annex
115:33 saying oh my god here it is and you know
115:35 here's the mothership
115:36 i i don't expect that i think
115:39 um well you know what i'm not going to
115:41 go any further than that i'm not going
115:43 to pine on what what i think might be in
115:44 that report um
115:46 but i think it will be consistent i i i
115:49 will tell you i don't think 144 days is
115:52 long enough
115:53 to provide a a comprehensive report it
115:55 takes longer to build a house
115:57 in some cases i'm not sure how you're
115:59 going to go to all
116:00 18 intelligence members of the
116:02 intelligence community
116:03 and get all the information that they
116:05 have which they themselves don't always
116:07 know where that information is or even
116:08 if they have it right
116:09 their little enclave little pockets that
116:11 takes time that takes coordination and
116:13 you got to make sure everybody who's
116:14 getting this information
116:16 has the appropriate appropriate security
116:17 clearance it's not just top secret sti
116:19 maybe it's sap maybe it's cap
116:20 maybe it's who knows there's all sorts
116:22 of of compensatory markings
116:25 and and levels of read on that not any
116:28 one individual necessarily has or knows
116:30 chris mellon said himself you know you
116:32 would have think being the
116:33 the guy running all the sap special
116:35 access program for the department of
116:36 defense
116:37 he would have known about our type of
116:38 effort but he did it right so
116:40 this kind of stuff flies under the radar
116:42 all the time and i'm not justifying that
116:44 i know people are going to say what that
116:45 shouldn't be you're right it shouldn't
116:47 be
116:47 but but it is and that's that's one of
116:49 the things we're trying to fix now
116:51 by putting some sort of mechanism in
116:53 place that put some sort of
116:54 administrative oversight
116:56 and and someone in a position of
116:58 authority to say you know be the daddy
116:59 bear say hey
117:00 you know that that information belongs
117:02 to me ultimately that comes to me
117:04 and that's that's what we're trying to
117:06 achieve i i've got about uh two minutes
117:08 before the break
117:09 has the uap task force uh
117:12 reached out to you and chris mellon
117:16 for information or consulting for this
117:19 report
117:20 i i can't answer that that would be up
117:23 for the u.s government
117:24 to answer that question um uh i'm not
117:26 saying yes or no it's just uh
117:28 uh that's um that's is it as a question
117:32 you would have to bring up
117:33 to to uh to the u.s government
117:37 great answer so the answer is yes okay

121:35 [Music]
121:45 welcome back fade to black i'm your host
121:46 jimmy church our guest tonight lou
121:48 elizondo what a great conversation
121:51 i expected this and so did you
121:54 and i want to take the opportunity uh
121:56 lou
121:57 in this next segment uh to discuss
122:00 disclosure and uh if you would i
122:04 asked this of every guest on the show uh
122:07 everyone um what is your definition
122:10 of disclosure
122:13 wow uh you know i've been asked that a
122:16 few times and and i hate to say this but
122:19 but i think my my definition keeps
122:21 changing um
122:22 you know disclosure for me is
122:25 i've always said it's a process it's not
122:27 an event and i think in five years from
122:30 now we're going to look back
122:31 and we are we're going to realize we are
122:33 actually living through disclosure right
122:35 now
122:37 disclosure for me is is
122:40 basically an acknowledgement by
122:43 by the cognizant authority to say that
122:46 these things are real
122:48 without ascribing a narrative without
122:50 ascribing an origin without ascribing
122:52 anything else um just
122:56 recognizing the reality that
122:59 uaps are real and they have been real
123:01 for a very long time
123:02 and that it's something that we we need
123:05 to pay attention to
123:07 i think for me um that is
123:10 that is that's the goal post and i think
123:14 i think to some degree we've achieved it
123:15 already you already have
123:17 key people in our government
123:18 acknowledging it so so i think you're
123:21 you're living through disclosure right
123:22 now
123:22 people say well i can't wait for
123:23 disclosure well you may be waiting a
123:26 long time because
123:27 if your definition of disclosure is a
123:29 ufo landing on the white house lawn
123:32 that may never happen i think i think
123:35 disclosure is the reason why it's so
123:37 hard to
123:38 to describe is because it means
123:40 something different to every everybody
123:41 out there
123:42 you can ask anybody anybody on the
123:43 street they'll probably give you a
123:45 a a different goal post for what
123:47 disclosure is
123:48 i also think we have to be careful
123:50 because confirmation is not necessarily
123:53 disclosure i hear the terms utilized
123:54 quite a bit no
123:55 confirmation and disclosure but to me
123:58 confirmation
123:59 is the confirming of a pre-existing
124:03 narrative that it is this way
124:07 and i am not sure we have enough
124:09 information or data yet
124:11 to have a narrative i know there's a lot
124:13 of people out there that think they have
124:15 a narrative
124:16 and they have the answers um i don't
124:19 i i think you know when people ask me
124:22 you know where are we on the journey are
124:23 we at the beginning of the end
124:25 and i say no let's say well are we at
124:27 the end of the beginning and
124:29 say no i i i don't mean to be
124:31 discouraging but i think we're at the
124:33 beginning of the beginning
124:35 but that's a good thing because that
124:36 means there's a whole lot more to come
124:38 that means there's a whole lot more
124:39 understanding and with with
124:40 understanding comes opportunity
124:42 so uh you know i'm not an all doom and
124:44 gloom kind of guy i try to be pragmatic
124:47 and practical as much as possible
124:48 and not allow my emotions to lead you
124:51 know my my decision making process
124:53 um unless it comes to my daughters of
124:55 course then that's a different
124:56 story but um you know then i'm
124:59 definitely
125:00 an emotional guy but in this particular
125:03 topic i
125:04 i think it's important that we let the
125:05 data speak for itself and there's still
125:07 a lot of data that
125:08 that hasn't been presented yet so uh my
125:11 word of advice would be try to resist
125:14 the urge as much as possible
125:17 of of having some sort of preconceived
125:19 notion or narrative
125:21 and you know take a breath for a moment
125:23 step back
125:24 and and and look at the new data that's
125:26 coming forward
125:27 now maybe it'll reconfirm the existing
125:29 narrative you already have
125:31 that's possible maybe it doesn't maybe
125:33 it helps inform something else and you
125:35 begin to evolve your position
125:37 which is also you know a good thing um
125:40 we're
125:40 as a human species we're constantly
125:42 learning and that's something that we
125:44 we should always encourage our fellow
125:46 brothers and sisters on this planet to
125:48 always do
125:49 learning is is an innate part of being a
125:51 human being just like breathing and just
125:52 like eating
125:54 it it's who we are it's in our dna
125:57 before
125:58 uh ttsa uh prior to 2017 126:03 um did atip have an interest in chris
126:07 bledsoe
126:07 and did you meet with him before the
126:10 forming of ttsa
126:13 uh i did not um i i did not that's not
126:16 to say that other elements
126:18 within uh the asap portfolio did
126:22 prior to me but i wasn't really
126:25 part of awesome i was tangentially
126:28 attached to it
126:29 but really my focus has always primarily
126:31 been on atip
126:32 and the bloodsow uh was not
126:35 uh the bloodsouls family were not
126:38 uh part of that the reason why look it's
126:40 very practical it's not that
126:42 we didn't or did believe them we're a
126:44 dod organization
126:45 operating under title 10 authorities
126:47 meaning title 10 meaning we can only
126:49 talk to
126:50 military or military related people and
126:53 have access to that information and the
126:55 data collection platforms
126:56 we couldn't just go out to private
126:58 citizens to to joe schmoe or
127:00 jane smith and say hey tell me what you
127:02 know about ufos or what have you seen or
127:03 anything paranormal
127:06 we weren't allowed to do that we had to
127:07 keep very narrowly focused because when
127:09 you present that data to dod leadership
127:12 there's all sorts of considerations
127:13 there not just the validity and the
127:15 veracity information that you're
127:16 collecting
127:17 but there's rules and laws i can't just
127:18 go out and collect
127:20 u.s persons information i said at the
127:22 beginning of this broadcast
127:24 there's collection retention and
127:25 dissemination of u.s persons information
127:28 that is very very res restrictive
127:31 any intelligence organization collecting
127:34 that can it's a big no-no
127:36 unless you have very specific approvals
127:38 to do that and then then there's even a
127:40 time limit so
127:41 so we couldn't go out just willy-nilly
127:43 and talk to anybody uh that that
127:45 that wasn't possible we'd get slapped
127:47 with the procedure 15 violation
127:48 very very quickly so um
127:52 to put it bluntly the answer is no um
127:55 have you but let me caveat that doesn't
127:57 that i want to make this very important
127:59 this important statement please um just
128:01 for a moment
128:03 that doesn't necessarily mean that what
128:06 is occurring at the blood
128:08 cells is or is not real it's just simply
128:12 we didn't look at it because the data
128:14 wasn't
128:15 uh within the subset that we were
128:17 allowed to look at if that makes sense
128:19 understood understood um have you ever
128:22 have you ever seen a ufo
128:28 i mean jimmy that was that was kind of
128:30 my job for almost 10 years yeah i
128:33 saw a lot of them um out uh uh
128:36 at night during the day accidents oh so
128:39 you're talking aside from my job i mean
128:42 your eyeballs yes
128:47 uh well i just want to be specific right
128:48 i don't want anybody to
128:50 read between the lines here um
128:54 i i would prefer to buy a vowel and
128:56 maybe the next time we have a chat
128:57 answer that question
128:59 um i i'm very careful not to superimpose
129:02 my own
129:03 personal experiences on the data
129:05 collection
129:06 i don't ever want to prejudice the jury
129:10 so to speak
129:11 in the collection of information it's
129:13 important that my own personal opinions
129:16 and positions are not factored into it
129:19 look at it like any court of law
129:21 as as an investigator your job is to to
129:24 collect the facts and preserve the facts
129:25 and then present those facts to to a
129:27 jury
129:28 in this case the american people are the
129:30 jury okay my job is simple collect the
129:32 truth speak the truth that's it
129:34 and then i take that information and i
129:36 provide it in a consumable manner
129:38 for for the jury in this case the
129:39 american people to have a conversation
129:41 about
129:42 as an employee
129:45 of our government in the department of
129:46 defense that was your career
129:48 one of the things if all all young men
129:52 do this myself included we take great
129:55 pride in
129:56 in in knowing aircraft and helicopters
129:59 and rockets and
130:00 the names of astronauts it's what we do
130:03 right it is
130:04 so you're you're out there and you see
130:06 something in the sky
130:08 when as a professional you can identify
130:11 anything
130:12 right soviet helicopter brazilian
130:16 training jet aircraft
130:18 you know what you're looking at when you
130:20 see something in the sky that you can't
130:22 explain what goes through your mind
130:25 so jimmy i'm gonna your your audience
130:27 can't see this but i'm going to show you
130:28 real quick these are
130:29 official department of defense
130:31 identification cards and
130:33 what you can see here are the profiles
130:35 of aircraft right this is a russian
130:37 helicopter absolutely you can see the
130:39 stack of this right this is
130:40 this is the training age that this that
130:43 that our military servicemen and women
130:45 in uniform are trained to identify the
130:47 difference between a european tornado
130:50 an f-16 an su-22 and a mig-25 130:53 from 20 miles away and by the way from
130:54 multiple different angles from the
130:56 bottom from the side from the top from
130:57 the front
130:58 that is is very much what our trained
131:01 observers are trained to do
131:03 and uh you're right when you see
131:06 something that doesn't look like
131:09 anything we have it doesn't even have
131:10 wings cockpit
131:11 engine control surfaces and yet somehow
131:14 is able to defy the natural effects of
131:16 earth's gravity
131:17 and pull g-forces nexus of 5 6 700 g's
131:20 and perform at speeds of
131:21 up to 13 000 miles an hour in our
131:24 atmosphere
131:25 um yeah that's that's that's a great
131:28 question isn't it
131:29 uh you know that makes you scratch your
131:30 head to say okay what are we dealing
131:32 with
131:33 is there a lazar sport model uh
131:36 flying saucer in in that deck of cards
131:39 i'm just asking
131:40 for a friend there is not
131:43 uh but uh also let me let me caveat that
131:47 i've never had uh the opportunity to
131:49 meet mr lazar so i i don't know
131:52 uh much about him i suspect your next
131:54 question is going to be what do i think
131:55 about him
131:56 no no no no no no no that's that's drama
132:00 uh we don't need we don't need to go
132:02 there but um
132:04 the other part of this though is
132:07 when you what we're talking about
132:10 disclosure here and when you see
132:12 for yourself something you don't
132:15 necessarily
132:16 need the president of the united states
132:18 to step up to a podium on live
132:20 television and say we not we are not
132:22 alone
132:23 because as a civilian you've seen what
132:25 you have seen
132:26 is that pushing part of your effort
132:30 here knowing privately what you have
132:33 seen
132:33 and then the other side of it where
132:35 you're trying to get those answers
132:37 yeah absolutely i mean it's
132:40 this is a global phenomenon jimmy this
132:43 isn't this isn't something new
132:45 this isn't something that was just
132:47 recognized when
132:49 when a tip came about or the program
132:51 before that or blue but before that or
132:52 the pro
132:53 you know when i was over in in italy i
132:56 had
132:56 uh someone show me an old scroll and it
132:59 was a discussion between
133:00 a a roman soldier and a roman general
133:03 this is a 2 000 year old document in
133:05 latin
133:05 and and it's a conversation where they
133:07 describe these things called the eclipse
133:09 eclipses the roman shield and they
133:12 describe these flaming roman shields in
133:14 the sky that would follow them from
133:16 battle space to battle space
133:18 um you know this is important this is
133:21 why
133:22 we are engaging in the what payton
133:23 project with with the indigenous people
133:25 because they have
133:26 thousands of years of oral tradition
133:29 going back
133:31 much longer than pre-recorded history um
133:34 and
133:34 i think it's it's important because some
133:37 of their observations you know they're
133:39 trained observers too they're just
133:40 trained observers from their own
133:41 perspective they they know the land and
133:43 their area like nobody else right just
133:45 like a pilot may know the airspace
133:47 better than anybody else
133:48 so it's important for us to to to try to
133:51 look at this information from a
133:53 comprehensive a holistic perspective
133:55 and see if we can see and by the way it
133:57 turns out we can the same
133:59 observables that we identified in atip
134:02 are
134:02 are all there they go back to the middle
134:04 ages and they go back to the roman times
134:06 even go back to some of the
134:08 the pre-recorded history that's that's
134:10 now part of the oral traditions of our
134:11 indigenous people
134:13 it's it's all there and so it's it's for
134:15 me it's it's fascinating and it is
134:18 something that compels me to continue to
134:20 to
134:21 to push this topic forward
134:24 and by the way you know you're part of
134:26 that equation too
134:27 your audience is part of that equation
134:30 we're all part of that equation
134:31 and this this is a topic that belongs to
134:33 all of us not one organization as i said
134:36 or government or institution or person
134:37 this is
134:38 we we all we all own this together
134:41 now uh uh i can't
134:44 uh let you get away with
134:48 without talking about the tic tac so in
134:50 the
134:51 limited time that we have left um i'm
134:54 going to start with this
134:55 are you kicking me off jimmy no hey you
134:58 want to go into overtime
134:59 i've got you you could tell your wife
135:02 uh you can blame me you can blame me we
135:05 can certainly do that
135:06 um but uh the
135:10 the tic tac is the tic tac
135:14 not of this earth the nimitz
135:18 encounter that the tic tac
135:21 is that not of this earth
135:24 jimmy forgive me for saying this i i
135:26 don't want to correct you publicly but
135:27 you're asking the wrong question
135:30 the question should be is the tic tac
135:33 man made or is the tic tac us
135:36 or is it tic tac us or foreign adversary
135:40 technology
135:41 the answer is no but when you say is it
135:44 from this earth
135:45 we don't know that's that's you know
135:48 this is why
135:48 we always stated before from our
135:51 position
135:52 we don't know if these things are from
135:54 outer space inner space or frankly the
135:56 space in between as you you begin to
135:58 understand the world of quantum physics
136:00 there's a whole lot of reality around us
136:02 and we don't interact with it um
136:04 you know we're used to the newtonian
136:06 understanding of the world
136:07 physics where you know gravity apple
136:09 falls from a tree and then along comes
136:11 einstein several hundred years later and
136:13 talks about this thing called relativity
136:14 where space time is actually flexible
136:17 and only in the last 20 30 years have we
136:19 really begin to explore the world of
136:20 quantum
136:21 quantum physics the quantum world the
136:23 quantum states
136:24 and we're realizing all these realities
136:27 as
136:27 as as opposite as they may seem to us
136:30 are actually very much part of the
136:32 natural environment and so my point
136:34 being there may be realities all around
136:36 us
136:36 that we simply don't perceive you know
136:39 we're very limited as a species we
136:41 we live in a three-dimensional space x y
136:43 z axis and time
136:45 which is a function of i guess of the
136:46 fourth dimension and and that's
136:48 expressed in
136:49 a linear linear if you will linear
136:52 motion for us
136:53 um but that's not to say that there
136:56 aren't other things all around us we
136:57 sense the universe
136:59 through the five primary senses of sight
137:01 smell touch
137:02 taste and hearing and yet we know that
137:05 we only perceive
137:06 one percent of one percent of the
137:08 universe that's around us
137:10 most of the universe remains completely
137:12 invisible to us and i don't mean
137:14 the universe out there i mean the
137:16 universe right here
137:17 let me put that into context we know
137:19 less than five percent
137:20 about our deepest oceans right we we've
137:23 mapped but we really don't even have a
137:25 good understanding of what lives in our
137:26 own planet let alone anywhere else
137:29 we when you look at the human being we
137:31 are exactly in the middle
137:33 of the scale of the universe if you were
137:36 to take us
137:37 being the smallest thing and look at the
137:39 grandiosity of the universe which is
137:42 13.5 billion light years in this
137:44 direction and 13.5 billion light years
137:46 in that direction right
137:47 27 billion light years in distance which
137:50 is a lot
137:50 we seem pretty small by that scale there
137:53 is
137:54 equally the same amount of space inside
137:57 of the human body
137:59 there is this entire universe inside of
138:02 us
138:02 when you talk about not just the cells
138:04 of the body or even the atoms if you
138:06 start talking about subatomic particles
138:07 you start talking about muons
138:09 and quarks this is reality this is real
138:12 even though we can't interact with it
138:13 there is
138:14 this entire universe inside each and
138:16 every one of us now i don't want to get
138:18 you know to off off the off the beaten
138:21 path here
138:21 but my point being is that there is so
138:25 much
138:25 we don't understand about the universe
138:28 let alone our own selves so i think
138:31 it is it is foolhardy for us
138:35 to even begin to say definitively
138:38 that well the buck stops with us
138:42 if we can't see it touch taste or smell
138:43 it doesn't exist well
138:45 that's clearly not true there are things
138:47 coursing through our body right now that
138:49 you'll you can't perceive but they're
138:51 just as real wi-fi
138:52 and sell signal and and emissions coming
138:55 in from satellites and
138:56 and radar waves all this is very
139:00 real and and and yet
139:03 beyond our our perception we we look at
139:05 the world through a very narrow band of
139:07 the electromagnetic spectrum
139:08 electro-optical spectrum
139:10 forgive me called light that's it
139:13 and that on when you look at the grand
139:14 scale is just a sliver
139:17 of what's really out there so
139:20 i guess my question to that is is you
139:23 know
139:23 going back to your original question are
139:25 they from earth uh are they not from
139:27 earth forgive me
139:28 um i don't know i don't know because
139:31 it's
139:32 it's it's not an either or question it's
139:34 not necessarily well if they're not from
139:35 here they must be from outer space
139:36 that's not true
139:38 there's a whole bunch of others there's
139:39 an option c and d
139:41 and e and f all the way to z of what
139:43 what it could be
139:44 and so let's not limit ourselves by
139:46 putting these artificial limitations
139:48 well if it's not here it must be out
139:50 there right we tend to be binary
139:51 creatures
139:52 we look at everything in extremes it's
139:53 either left or right upper down hot or
139:56 cold good or bad
139:57 and that's probably because we're cardio
139:59 social animals
140:01 some scientists believe neuroscientists
140:03 believe the first nine months of
140:05 all humans are are for the most part in
140:07 our mother's womb
140:08 womb and the heartbeat that we hear uh
140:11 that on
140:11 off that binary sets the stage for the
140:14 way we think as a species
140:16 right we look at everything in terms of
140:17 this either on or off so to speak
140:20 but in reality universe doesn't work
140:21 that way the universe isn't binary the
140:23 universe
140:24 operates in fractals the universe
140:25 operates and diagonals
140:27 uh it it it it you know it
140:31 it uh it manifests itself in all sorts
140:34 of magical ways um
140:36 you know one can look at go ahead i'm
140:38 sorry
140:39 i know i'm probably going a little bit
140:40 too deep here no
140:42 what you everything that you just said
140:44 we discuss on this show
140:45 uh a few nights a week okay so no you're
140:48 not
140:49 venturing into a territory that this
140:51 audience doesn't understand
140:52 but bringing up the universe the tic tac
140:56 is not uh a united states
140:59 thing it's a global it's not a united
141:02 it's not right it's written united
141:03 states thing and it's not it's not a
141:05 foreign adversarial technology so what
141:06 it is we don't know but it ain't ours
141:10 would uh would there be a cooperation
141:14 with china or with the soviet union
141:19 with what the tic tac represents is
141:22 there
141:22 is there back channel communication
141:24 about this data
141:26 i i can't i can't discuss that but what
141:29 i can say is if you look at the recent
141:31 uh headlines of japan reaching out and
141:33 establishing a bilateral
141:35 information sharing relationship with
141:36 the united states specifically for the
141:38 purposes
141:39 of sharing uap information that's
141:40 probably a pretty good indicator
141:42 yeah and uh the
141:45 is is it something that you don't
141:48 necessarily
141:50 want another uh an adversary
141:54 to have information too as well is it in
141:57 our best interest to keep
141:58 our data to ourselves well sure and
142:01 remember
142:02 today's friend could be tomorrow's
142:03 adversary and tomorrow's adversary could
142:05 be our friend look at look at vietnam
142:06 for a second
142:07 right i mean in the 60s when probably
142:09 when your father was in you know it was
142:11 a pretty tough place
142:12 uh and and we left under there under
142:15 some really bad circumstances
142:17 and now they're a wonderful trading
142:19 partner in fact we go there all the time
142:21 to go to their beaches and tourism and
142:23 and we have a wonderful relationship
142:24 with vietnam so you know
142:26 the problem is when you're talking about
142:28 governments you're really talking about
142:30 people and people are very fickle
142:32 people run hot and cold all the time and
142:35 whenever you have relationships with
142:38 other countries
142:39 unfortunately it's usually out of
142:40 convenience
142:42 not really out of sincere friendship um
142:45 most of the time and that's just the way
142:49 governments are unfortunately um i am
142:52 hopeful that a topic like this might be
142:55 able to bridge that gap
142:56 and and and force enemies to become
143:00 friends
143:01 um you know let's let's let's look at
143:03 this jimmy you and i
143:05 are having a conversation right now
143:06 never in a million years would people
143:08 expect you and i
143:09 to share the same airwaves right i know
143:13 philosophically you have probably you
143:15 had a significant difference of opinion
143:18 as i do but that's okay because we can
143:21 find common ground
143:22 in this topic and just like you and i
143:25 are able to have an amicable
143:26 conversation right now over the airwaves
143:29 government should be able to do the same
143:30 thing if we can do it they sure as hell
143:32 can do it i don't know why not so
143:34 i when i said before there's a lot of
143:36 hope there and there's a lot of
143:37 opportunity that's what i meant
143:39 this is an area for us to to this is a
143:42 global
143:43 issue we should just like climate change
143:45 we should handle this
143:47 uh from a global perspective and how
143:49 wonderful it would be that we could
143:50 actually work
143:51 with russia or china on this topic and
143:54 yes
143:54 maybe even iran or north korea and and
143:57 for just a moment put aside our
143:59 differences
144:00 and let's share our commonalities as as
144:03 a species not as a country
144:05 not as a nation but truly as a
144:07 civilization
144:08 as a planet as a planet and now there's
144:12 another interesting thing here and i
144:14 know that you've thought about this but
144:16 you've never been asked this question
144:18 both gemini and i like long walks on the
144:21 beach yes you do
144:22 is is this uh i find it interesting and
144:25 beyond coincidence that both of these
144:28 uh incidents happened with the navy
144:31 with battle groups on off the coast of
144:34 the united states
144:38 the tic tac didn't happen over los
144:40 angeles the tic tac didn't happen
144:42 over wichita it happened with the
144:44 military
144:46 why i mean that's the question why
144:50 there's got to be an answer there well
144:53 you know it it could be that the
144:55 pervasiveness of military technology
144:57 happens to be in places where
144:58 most people aren't and it just happens
145:00 to be a hot spot or
145:02 uh when you look at a nuclear carrier
145:03 group you realize you have
145:05 you know a huge nuclear profile you've
145:07 got you've got
145:09 ships that are powered by nuclear
145:11 technology
145:12 you have ships with the capability to
145:14 have nuclear weapons on board
145:15 and then you have submarines that are
145:17 not only nuclear power but in some cases
145:19 may also have nuclear weapons on board
145:20 so
145:21 in that small of a footprint of a of a
145:24 fleet
145:24 you have a you have more more nuclear
145:28 technology than than you have probably
145:30 the entire state of new york
145:32 so uh is it possible that
145:35 there is some uh congruency there that
145:39 that there is an effort to to
145:42 conduct some sort of surveillance
145:44 operation on our nuclear capabilities
145:46 we've seen them over our nuclear silos
145:49 we see them over a nuclear-powered
145:51 capabilities
145:52 is that one of the connections we're
145:55 seeing
145:57 and i'm going to leave that question to
145:59 you to answer
146:00 well is it is it also inside the realm
146:03 of possibility that
146:05 northrop or another uh
146:09 aerospace uh technology company is
146:13 is testing their technology on on
146:16 us to see what can be read on radar what
146:19 pilots would witness what the crews
146:21 would witness
146:22 and something that we would use in a
146:25 theater
146:25 later against an adversary yeah so that
146:28 red teaming that you're talking about is
146:30 done with tremendous amount of
146:31 coordination the last thing you ever
146:32 want to do is fly some sort of super
146:34 secret technology next to a battle
146:36 carrier group or a carrier battle group
146:38 um that's suicide you are going to get
146:40 shot down out of the sky at some point
146:42 or they're going to launch a missile at
146:44 you or they're going to hit you with a
146:45 sea whiz
146:46 you will not survive very long that is a
146:48 dumb place to do it if you want to test
146:50 the capabilities
146:51 you do it at a place like area 51 where
146:53 you can control the environment and you
146:55 don't have to worry about
146:56 fishermen out on fishing boats or people
146:58 on the coast
146:59 or other people by mistake coming across
147:02 your technology
147:03 i can tell you that is not the way the
147:05 department of defense works
147:06 absolutely do we test our technology on
147:08 ourselves sure
147:09 but we coordinate it because we don't
147:11 want to have a mishap where
147:12 all of a sudden we have a collision with
147:14 one of these things and we kill a pilot
147:16 or worse it crashes and now that
147:18 technology is all over the ocean
147:20 and now the russians can come by with a
147:21 submarine and scoop it up that that's
147:23 not the way we do business
147:24 and anybody who says that doesn't know
147:26 how the government works
147:28 would the uh pentagon uh
147:31 look to another private uh group
147:34 out there like ttsa uh to share
147:38 information and funnel stuff through i
147:41 can't answer that that's a question
147:42 you'd have to ask the government
147:43 well and you understand why oh i do sure
147:46 sure
147:47 why i think it's a good question i just
147:49 i can't answer that
147:50 with uh why why did
147:53 uh going back to this subject completely
147:56 it
147:56 seems that uh ttsa took their foot off
148:00 the gas
148:01 when it came to uh bringing information
148:04 forward
148:05 we we continually went back to the tic
148:09 tac in the roosevelt
148:10 and and those three videos and that and
148:13 the testimony and all of that was
148:14 excellent
148:15 but that was three years ago almost four
148:17 we're in the fourth year
148:19 now and it seems that ttsa took the foot
148:22 off the gas
148:24 was it because they didn't have anything
148:26 else to bring forward
148:27 or is ttsa sitting on stuff that we will
148:30 see
148:31 in the future jimmy another great
148:34 question you'd have to ask the folks at
148:35 ttsa
148:36 i can't speak on behalf of ttsa i can
148:38 tell you you know the things that chris
148:40 mellon and i are working on
148:42 are absolutely pushing the ball down the
148:44 field
148:45 what people have noticed probably about
148:46 us we tend to go dark for a little while
148:48 uh before another
148:51 major if you will announcement that
148:54 comes
148:56 we are absolutely engaged in the fight
148:58 on a daily if not hourly basis
149:00 this is what we do but
149:04 what ttsa is doing now now that they're
149:07 focusing on the entertainment piece
149:09 i i really can't tell you because i
149:10 really don't know i i don't
149:12 have insight into their daily operations
149:15 um
149:16 as i did last time um you know for the
149:18 last few years
149:19 um they're they're kind of doing their
149:21 thing and we're doing our thing
149:23 and that's that's where we are i want to
149:26 thank you
149:27 what a great conversation tonight i look
149:29 forward to the next time
149:30 and uh i have to ask the obvious
149:33 what are you working on now and what is
149:36 in the future
149:40 i love watching you squirm by the way
149:43 yeah your audience only had a camera
149:46 they could see what i'm doing right now
149:47 i'm kind of fidgeting and trying to look
149:49 for a way out um
149:51 so uh what am i working on now we are
149:54 working on a permanent solution
149:56 uh and i'll i'll leave it at that where
149:59 are we going for the future what can we
150:01 expect
150:02 hopefully a permanent solution what what
150:05 does that even mean
150:06 you should run for office i mean
150:10 what does that mean you don't want me
150:13 running for office i'm not sure i'd get
150:15 get very many votes um it means that the
150:19 things that we had set out to do
150:20 originally we are still pursuing with
150:22 great vigor
150:23 and um i think it's fair to say that a
150:26 task force by government terms has
150:28 always been designed to be a temporary
150:29 capability
150:30 uh but this is a persistent problem that
150:33 we're facing with uaps it's a persistent
150:35 question
150:36 and i'm not sure a temporary capability
150:38 is the best way to answer
150:39 a to address a persistent problem i
150:42 think you need a persistent capability
150:44 to address a persistent problem
150:46 did you feel that's an interesting
150:48 answer uh
150:49 lou did you feel that uh
150:53 ttsa was was holding you back was there
150:57 was was that it because you just said
150:59 we're trying to complete what we started
151:01 why not stay with the team and and keep
151:03 this moving forward
151:05 did you felt constricted ctsa wasn't
151:08 holding us back it just
151:09 it just shifted its focus into an area
151:13 that was that was considered still
151:15 helpful
151:17 but was was i think probably
151:20 more more appropriate for any company
151:24 any business that's trying to seek a
151:25 return on investment
151:26 a lot of the efforts chris and i are are
151:29 part of are
151:30 our long-term long-duration efforts
151:33 uh where the return on investment isn't
151:36 necessarily monetary
151:39 and it's it's it's a little bit more
151:40 perhaps esoteric
151:43 and so my leaving ttsa was a mutual
151:47 decision
151:48 between ttsa and myself in order to
151:51 allow chris and i and others to continue
151:54 to pursue this effort from from the area
151:56 of expertise that
151:57 we bring to the table right while
151:59 allowing
152:00 ttsa to fulfill its mission and its
152:03 commitment to its
152:04 stockholders but much beyond that you'd
152:07 really have to talk to ttsa again i'm
152:09 not at
152:10 i'm not at liberty uh to discuss ttsa
152:13 business because i
152:14 i'm not there anymore yeah sure sure um
152:17 do you
152:19 do you think that personally because you
152:21 did go uh public
152:23 after um into the private sector after
152:26 leaving
152:26 the department of defense that
152:30 any pot do you okay
152:34 do you still have connections and
152:36 friends at the dod
152:38 that can help you move this forward or
152:42 because you went private and started
152:44 talking
152:45 that maybe that cooperation isn't there
152:48 anymore
152:50 no the first um
152:53 i definitely maintain relationships with
152:56 with people back
152:57 in in the department and not just the
152:58 department of defense uh the u.s
153:00 government at large
153:02 um i think it's important that you know
153:06 we we do this together and i don't want
153:08 to ever do anything that's out of sync
153:10 or out of step
153:10 i don't want to do anything to
153:11 compromise efforts that are going on
153:14 in the government i don't want to do
153:15 anything that that can be perceived as
153:17 being destructive i want it to be
153:19 i want to be constructive i want to be
153:21 helpful i want to be an enabler
153:23 i don't want to be someone that
153:24 interferes uh
153:26 with efforts um that's that's not what
153:28 this is about
153:29 this is about helping the government do
153:31 the job that it's supposed to do
153:33 uh in in a way that is in the best
153:36 interest of the american people
153:37 and that's what i'm committed to see you
153:39 didn't squirm
153:41 what he said said that you were very
153:44 very matter-of-fact and determined in
153:47 that and and i really appreciate that
153:49 the audience can't see uh what i see
153:51 here but you just said that with uh such
153:54 conviction
153:56 well i believe it i mean i'm not
153:59 you know i'm not a an overly intelligent
154:01 person i'm not a you know rocket
154:02 scientist i'm not a
154:04 uh you know a lawyer or anything like
154:07 that um
154:08 i'm just just a government servant and a
154:11 servant to the american people always
154:13 happened i
154:14 took an oath to defend this country uh
154:17 long ago from all enemies foreign and
154:18 domestic and sometimes those enemies are
154:21 our bureaucracy
154:22 sometimes the enemy isn't necessarily
154:24 holding an ak-47 154:26 uh it's holding a pen and paper or it's
154:29 it's
154:29 it's stove pipes within the system um
154:33 and you know what i'm still very much
154:34 committed to to that mission
154:36 um you know i i i know that probably
154:39 hinders me to some degree because
154:41 there's some people who really don't
154:42 like the fact that i have connections to
154:44 the government
154:46 but i would say that i i don't think we
154:48 would be here where we are today in this
154:50 conversation
154:51 if if if we didn't have those
154:53 relationships
154:54 again everybody should be on the boat
154:56 this is this is a topic that affects all
154:58 of us equally
154:59 and and to to excuse a pun but
155:02 but to alienate people in the government
155:05 um
155:06 you know i that's i don't think that's
155:08 that's helpful i don't think that's
155:09 constructive we need them on board
155:11 we need their talents we need their
155:12 expertise to help figure this out
155:15 um do you have um uh
155:18 see i've got so many questions i i just
155:21 can't end this right now
155:22 lose okay have have
155:26 you had somebody
155:29 advise you on where and what not to say
155:34 to run interference for instance like
155:36 during this broadcast tonight
155:38 uh did you get a text right dude slow
155:41 down
155:42 this isn't a zone that you need to go
155:44 into
155:45 um are are you free of that or
155:50 do you get do you get a phone call once
155:52 in a while from the man
155:53 well i i know my left and right limits i
155:56 i've worked for the man for long enough
155:57 where i i know how to mine my p's and
155:59 q's
156:00 um you know i i i if i get a call it's
156:03 because i said something wrong
156:05 um you know it's uh do i get texts
156:08 all the time but um
156:11 i'm i'm very careful um
156:15 in the way i have a conversation and
156:16 again i know probably it's frustrating
156:18 for some people they probably look at
156:19 that and saying oh you know you're being
156:21 evasive and whatnot yeah i am
156:22 i am being a basis of sometimes because
156:25 there's other things at stake it's not
156:27 just about lou elizondo and this is what
156:28 i keep trying to drive home to people
156:30 you know this is the problem with this
156:33 topic
156:34 is that there are so many personalities
156:35 in this topic and you all of a sudden
156:37 when you're in a position
156:38 where people think you have some sort of
156:40 authority you get put up on this
156:41 pedestal where you are this almost this
156:43 demigod right and no matter what you say
156:45 that's taken his gospel and that's
156:47 dangerous that that's exactly what we
156:50 don't need what we need is is is
156:52 conversation and discussion and dialogue
156:55 and collaboration
156:56 we don't need someone standing up on a
156:58 podium saying this is the way it shall
156:59 be
157:00 and you know it's it's the way i think
157:02 about it is the answer you know all that
157:04 other stuff is is
157:06 nonsense i i don't think that's helpful
157:09 and you know that's why i refrain from
157:12 giving my opinion most of the time
157:13 because
157:14 at the end of the day jimmy it doesn't
157:15 matter what my opinion is
157:17 what matters are what facts and the data
157:19 says and it's very very important i
157:21 could get
157:22 i could spend the next 10 hours telling
157:24 you what i think but
157:25 at the end of the day it's just what i
157:26 think and i've sold i've said this
157:28 before to people
157:30 the one thing i've learned in
157:31 intelligence is that you can be
157:32 absolutely
157:33 certain of something and still be
157:35 absolutely wrong
157:37 and i don't want to be in that category
157:38 i don't want to be there's too much at
157:40 stake i don't want to be held
157:41 responsible
157:42 for leading people down a road turns out
157:44 to be bs
157:46 that's that's that would be the worst
157:48 thing i could do this this this
157:49 community is fraught with hucksters and
157:51 shysters and
157:52 and people that have have made a living
157:54 of defrauding other human beings off
157:55 their hard earned money
157:56 and all in in search of the truth and i
157:59 think that's a perversion of the truth
158:01 you know i'm not doing this to get rich
158:03 the hell i last two years i was living
158:04 in a trailer
158:05 literally so you know this is it hasn't
158:08 been easy i'm doing this because i
158:10 really believe in what i'm doing just
158:12 like you really believe in what you're
158:14 doing and um
158:17 i'll leave it at that that's why uh
158:19 that's why i don't offer my opinion that
158:21 often
158:21 well you uh and we talked about this
158:24 earlier
158:25 and and i told you that lou i told you
158:28 you need to remember what you just said
158:30 so you can say it again
158:32 and what happened we forgot right
158:35 okay so let's see if we i can pull this
158:38 out of you again
158:39 which is this you have got a lot
158:42 of of of fans out there i'll uh
158:46 let's just leave it there but
158:50 that have put you up into a position
158:54 that uh deity right
158:58 almost uh a godlike uh
159:01 spot you are are you
159:05 cognizant of that and
159:08 do you believe the hype right okay well
159:10 first of all i i'm
159:12 i'm cognizant that a lot of people give
159:13 me credit that i don't deserve
159:15 um and do i believe the hype absolutely
159:18 not
159:19 i i am i'm not one of those guys that
159:21 never have been um
159:22 i i am um profoundly boring i'm sure
159:26 if you were to ever meet me in person um
159:30 you know i that is for me that is the
159:33 devil so many people start believing the
159:36 hype
159:36 and they start believing what people are
159:38 telling them about themselves
159:40 instead of remaining true to themselves
159:42 and then the next thing you know
159:44 they're lost they're gone and and
159:47 that's a real danger you know i
159:49 fortunately for me i've spent my life in
159:51 the shadows
159:52 so i i love my anonymity i love my
159:55 privacy i tend to be very introverted
159:57 even though people see me
159:58 oh you're very extroverted i'm actually
160:00 not a very introverted
160:01 uh that's hell that's why they live in
160:03 the live in the middle of nowhere
160:04 wyoming right um
160:07 for me i think it's important that we
160:09 always remain
160:10 grounded remember where we come from
160:12 remember where we're trying to go
160:14 and make sure that when you climb that
160:16 mountain you
160:17 always reach a hand down to pull
160:19 somebody up
160:20 um that has been my philosophy from day
160:24 one
160:24 and and leadership in in the government
160:27 i think is oftentimes misunderstood
160:30 uh with with with management
160:34 leadership is a unique quality and and a
160:36 leader will never tell you they're a
160:38 leader
160:39 a leader is is uh is
160:42 is assigned that role by other people
160:44 never themselves
160:46 um i i i do my best
160:49 to always try to leave this planet maybe
160:53 in a little bit better condition than i
160:55 found it
160:56 um i always try to pay it forward um
160:59 i've had
161:00 unfortunately had to do some horrible
161:01 things in my life uh
161:03 and in times of conflict um
161:06 you know these are things that uh
161:09 nobody should ever have to do
161:11 unfortunately but the reality is that
161:13 that
161:14 this is not a perfect world and we have
161:15 to do what we have to do sometimes
161:17 um but uh
161:20 for me i i always remember i always
161:23 remember where i came from and i
161:24 remember where people come from
161:26 because at the end of the day it's all
161:27 about people there shouldn't be any my
161:30 team versus your team team lou or team

167:56 welcome back fade to black i'm your host
167:58 jimmy church there you go
168:02 lou elizondo what a great conversation i
168:05 could have kept it going out of respect
168:08 to lou um uh yeah yeah i could have kept
168:12 it going but
168:13 uh wow what a conversation what did you
168:16 think 747-228-2051 168:19 i've got enough time here for a couple
168:23 of calls and i'll get to that in a
168:24 second
168:25 but uh there was uh uh so much
168:28 of course that was left on the table and
168:31 we will save all of that
168:32 uh for a future show and and and do it
168:36 once again with lou but that was a great
168:38 conversation
168:39 and i hope that i got
168:42 uh enough in tonight for everybody there
168:45 was just
168:45 so many lots of questions were coming in
168:48 and
168:49 and i was taking a look at all of that
168:51 but uh that was great that was a great
168:52 conversation
168:54 and uh there you go i'm looking at some
168:56 of the of the uh the comments in twitter
168:59 and and i agree but but then again you
169:01 have to go back
169:02 and and and listen to how how lou said
169:06 it you know hey
169:07 uh uh i i i'm i'm being evasive because
169:11 i have to be
169:12 and uh i'm of course uh paraphrasing but
169:16 that's uh that's the nature of of
169:20 of not only uh himself personally but
169:23 what we are dealing with here
169:24 and his connections and and his oaths
169:27 and and
169:28 everything else but that being said
169:31 very open and uh i don't think
169:35 i don't think he didn't answer uh a
169:37 question
169:38 yeah yeah that was pretty cool that was
169:41 pretty cool i need to digest this
169:43 uh as well as everybody else so with
169:45 that let's go to the phones hi you're
169:46 live on fade to black who's calling
169:50 you're live hello yes you're live
169:56 hello so uh just curious like about the
169:59 whole
170:00 consciousness phenomena behind behind
170:02 this whole thing you know that's kind of
170:04 the
170:04 main thing i kind of wanted to hear
170:06 about um
170:08 you know i'm just
170:14 yeah what's your name
170:22 uh what do you mean consciousness
170:27 so i mean that there are different
170:30 you know parts of reality that are based
170:34 off of
170:35 different levels like that so i'm just
170:37 wondering
170:38 you know i mean there are different
170:40 parts of
170:43 that i'm just uh i don't know
170:46 wondering now that's the question
170:50 okay you're great you're breaking up
170:52 there joe you're going with this
170:54 would be the subject of another show i
170:57 mean when it comes to and i want to
170:58 thank you for the phone call
171:00 um when it comes to this um and
171:04 and consciousness and and contact we
171:06 didn't get
171:07 into that tonight on the show that is
171:09 such a broad
171:11 broad subject um but i think that
171:14 it is something that uh everybody
171:17 is interested in i don't know
171:20 uh lou's take on any of that but uh
171:23 i'll uh i'll do that on a future show
171:26 and
171:27 uh like i said that's a broad broad
171:30 conversation that's a that's a full show
171:32 in itself but it's something that we are
171:34 all interested in
171:35 i know um and i'm going to make this
171:38 brief because i've got
171:39 calls on hold i know that
171:43 i can go out with a group of friends and
171:46 have a positive
171:48 uh mindset and want to see
171:51 something and then all of a sudden
171:54 something happens
171:55 and i i don't know what's going on there
171:58 but it seems to
172:00 me that there is a direct connection
172:03 with us as as individuals i don't know
172:06 what that is
172:08 but i am fascinated with that let's go
172:10 back to the phones hi you're live on
172:11 fade to black who's calling the subject
172:14 of another show i mean when it comes oh
172:16 you gotta turn me down in the background
172:18 um when it comes to this hello yes
172:21 turn me down in the background doing it
172:24 right now jimmy
172:26 how are you okay who's this take me out
172:28 speaker
172:29 oh okay sorry about that this is joe
172:32 from huntsville alabama
172:34 hi joe from huntsville alabama how are
172:36 you
172:37 i'm good how you doing jimmy it's uh
172:39 well it was a pretty fun show what did
172:41 you think
172:42 i i thought it was one of the best
172:44 interviews you've done
172:46 uh i i thought it was great that you had
172:49 you had you finally had lu
172:50 on the thing that i think is incredibly
172:53 interesting
172:54 and and i'm i'm somebody who came out of
172:56 the government uh
172:58 but have been around the the topic of
173:01 the phenomenon for about 30 years
173:03 what i've found interesting is is after
173:07 the 2017 new york times article
173:11 everyone seems so confused
173:15 by the concept of something flying
173:20 in restricted airspace as being a threat
173:24 now if if the morning of
173:28 september 11 2001 at 10 o'clock in the
173:31 morning
173:32 eastern time if there would have been a
173:35 report that came out
173:36 that there was an unidentified plane
173:40 that wasn't responding to communications
173:43 nobody knew who was flying it where it
173:45 came from
173:47 what its intentions were but it was
173:49 flying over the white house
173:51 people would be freaking out and the
173:54 government be trying to shoot it down
173:56 but here we are almost 20 years later
174:00 and we've got validated reports from
174:04 the department of defense stating that
174:07 there are
174:08 quote unidentified craft aircraft if you
174:12 will
174:12 flying over even even more
174:16 restricted airspace than then in some
174:19 cases
174:20 maybe even the white house but nobody
174:22 seems to be able to get their head
174:24 around why
174:24 that's a threat and these are craft that
174:27 we have no idea what they are they're
174:29 clearly not in the u s
174:30 inventory that's been confirmed by the
174:32 government and i i guess
174:35 the narrative of the naysayers
174:39 is just very confusing and conflicting i
174:41 think
174:42 what you did tonight was help provide a
174:44 lot of important
174:54 just across the community need to be
174:56 very appreciative of you
174:58 is the fact that i think what was
174:59 highlighted tonight is what's needed
175:02 is a disclosure caucus at the
175:04 congressional level so
175:06 you know to me the the community at
175:08 large that's out there
175:10 that wants to throw
175:13 stones every time someone comes out with
175:16 facts verifiable facts which i think
175:19 lose a lot of the lose data that lose
175:22 put up terrified
175:25 barring that why does those same
175:27 community
175:28 uh of people the same community of
175:30 interest go to their politicians and
175:32 lobby for a disclosure caucus
175:34 because there seems to be a caucus for
175:37 almost
175:38 every uh area of interest or special
175:41 interest group
175:42 and to me the the community at large
175:44 that's so passionate about this
175:47 should be involved in a grassroots
175:50 campaign
175:51 that pushes members of congress to work
175:54 in a bipartisan fashion
175:55 across the aisle to establish a
175:58 disclosure caucus and then
175:59 you know the community at large can can
176:01 take their issue to the polls
176:03 politicians who are a member of the
176:05 caucus can get support
176:07 and the ones who don't support
176:09 disclosure or who are not a member of
176:11 the disclosure
176:12 caucus should not get the vote if it's
176:14 that important
176:16 to the the traditional ufo community or
176:19 the
176:19 ufologists or the those interested in
176:22 the uap
176:23 topic but i i think you did an amazing
176:25 job jimmy
176:26 uh you asked a lot of hard questions
176:29 and and god bless you we just we we
176:31 appreciate the fact that
176:33 you know you're you're raising awareness
176:35 on such an important topic
176:37 thank you joe and uh enjoy
176:40 the rest of your evening man thank you
176:42 so much
176:44 youtube thank you jimmy thank you have a
176:47 great night
176:48 and uh yeah the disclosure caucus
176:53 i mean would that even be possible
176:56 um i i still say we should have a
176:59 a disclosure march right the million
177:02 disclosure march
177:04 we should we should do something like
177:06 that we should organize it and
177:08 i think it would be fun and uh

00:13 luis elizondo
00:14 is a u.s army veteran who served for two
00:17 decades as a counterintelligence officer
00:20 for the department of defense in 2009 he
00:23 was made the director of one of the
00:25 pentagon's most clandestine programs
00:27 one that would not come to light for
00:29 another eight years from reporters
00:31 leslie kane and ralph blumenthal
00:33 the new york times published its
00:34 groundbreaking article that subsequently
00:36 brought this program
00:38 out of the shadows it was called the
00:40 advanced aerospace
00:41 threat identification program known
00:43 internally as atip
00:45 and its purpose was the tracking and
00:48 analysis
00:48 of ufos or what is being more commonly
00:51 referred to by the united states defense
00:53 and intelligence apparatus as
00:55 unidentified
00:56 aerial phenomena or uap
01:00 the atip program was responsible for
01:02 analyzing the capabilities and techno
01:05 signatures
01:05 of uap in order to extrapolate
01:08 understandings and theories
01:10 on the physics and technology behind
01:12 these completely unknown
01:13 beyond next generation platforms the
01:16 main concern
01:17 of the program was that these uaps
01:19 possessed the ability to penetrate
01:21 highly secure u.s nuclear facilities and
01:24 training grounds
01:25 and were even reported to shadow u.s
01:27 carrier groups and warplanes into active
01:30 combat theaters in the middle east
01:32 as the director of the a-tip program
01:34 luella zondo has been made aware of
01:36 information pertaining to the uap
01:38 portfolio that has not come to light as
01:40 of yet
01:41 and he is still very much beholden to
01:43 active non-disclosure agreements with
01:45 the us government
01:46 as it pertains to their role and breadth
01:48 of knowledge regarding the uap
01:50 issue due to internal struggles within
01:52 the department of defense conflicting
01:54 belief systems
01:55 as well as a lack of reporting up the
01:57 chain of command in regards to the
01:59 workings of atip
02:00 mr elizondo decided to resign from the
02:02 department of defense
02:03 in order for him to in his own words
02:06 carry on the mission that he was given
02:08 which was to get to the bottom of what
02:10 the uap issue is
02:11 and whether or not it represents a
02:13 threat to both the american people
02:15 and humanity as a whole after leaving
02:18 the department of defense louisando
02:19 joined forces with individuals such as
02:21 the former deputy assistant secretary of
02:23 defense for intelligence christopher
02:25 mellon
02:26 a man who was absolutely integral in
02:28 getting the three
02:29 now famous navy videos of uaps released
02:32 out into the public domain
02:33 these videos were recorded via the
02:35 forward-looking infrared camera pods of
02:37 us navy f-18 fighter jets
02:40 whilst they were undergoing large-scale
02:41 training exercises
02:43 both louis lozando and christopher
02:45 mellon alongside other high-ranking
02:47 government insiders and scientists
02:49 joined the public benefit corporation
02:51 known as to the stars academy of arts
02:53 and science
02:54 spearheaded by an unlikely character the
02:56 former blink 182 rock star tom delonge
02:59 who has a long-standing passion and
03:01 research background on the ufo subject
03:04 using his fame and his networking
03:06 abilities tom managed to secure meetings
03:08 with highly credentialed individuals
03:10 within the us government
03:11 spearhead defense contractors such as
03:13 lockheed martin
03:14 and was even invited into clandestine
03:16 meetings within the inner sanctums of
03:18 nasa
03:20 in order to create what would eventually
03:22 become to the stars academy of arts and
03:24 science
03:24 which would strive to raise awareness
03:26 regarding the issues of uaps
03:28 with the intention of starting a serious
03:30 conversation and engaging with the
03:32 american people and its body politic
03:34 on this fundamentally important issue
03:37 luellazando alongside christopher mellon
03:39 and former lockheed skunk works advanced
03:41 programs director steve justice
03:43 have recently departed from to the stars
03:45 academy with the intention of moving as
03:47 luelozondo puts it
03:49 into second gear i have been very much
03:52 hoping to have an
03:53 opportunity to speak with someone as
03:54 highly credentialed and
03:56 knowledgeable as lou and it is genuinely
03:58 a privilege for myself
04:00 to now be in a position to do exactly
04:01 that now before we start the interview
04:04 i need to provide a quick disclaimer
04:06 upon the request of luella zondo
04:08 now i personally did not find him to be
04:10 lacking of energy
04:11 at all i thoroughly enjoyed the
04:13 conversation and found many of his
04:15 answers to be extremely insightful
04:17 however lou wanted me to apologize to
04:20 all of you if he sounded tired during
04:22 this conversation
04:23 something that really struck me was the
04:25 humble nature of this individual and his
04:27 genuine desire
04:28 to assist in his effort of uap
04:30 transparency a desire
04:32 and passion that has caused him to
04:34 forego his need for rest of late and has
04:36 instead been tirelessly contributing to
04:38 various platforms
04:40 via these types of interviews like i
04:42 said i did not get the feeling that he
04:44 was tired but he insisted that i provide
04:46 this apology from him
04:47 to all of you and he has promised to
04:49 return for another interview on project
04:50 unity in the near future
04:52 and so i would like to wholeheartedly
04:54 thank him for his perseverance and i
04:56 hope he's now having a well deserved
04:58 respite
04:58 he has most certainly earned it and
05:00 without further ado
05:02 i hope you all enjoyed this conversation
05:03 between myself and mr louise elizondo
05:09 let's have a quick sip of my tea classic
05:10 british guy over here i've got a cup of
05:12 tea
05:13 by the way the uk is my wife's favorite
05:15 country she
05:16 every time we go she she cries when we
05:19 leave she
05:20 absolutely loves the uk well it's
05:22 there's a lot to love about it apart
05:24 from the weather
05:25 well i can imagine that would probably
05:26 be a little bit of a challenge
05:29 so it is an absolute pleasure to finally
05:32 have a chance to sit down and speak with
05:33 you i must admit that with a man
05:35 such as yourself there are so many
05:36 questions i want to ask you and i know
05:38 we only have about an hour to do this
05:40 so you'll have to forgive me for my
05:41 slight sense of urgency but i want to
05:43 try and get as many of these questions
05:45 put forward to you as i can but
05:46 let me just first say thank you so much
05:48 for taking the time to speak with me
05:50 it's honestly a privilege for myself to
05:52 be in this position
05:53 and it is sincerely my privilege to
05:55 thank you so much and by the way thank
05:57 you very much
05:59 for what you do and what your audience
06:00 does um
06:02 you know i think a lot of people have
06:04 over time given me
06:05 credit that probably is not um fully
06:08 deserved because
06:09 as i've always said this has been a team
06:11 effort and i mean it sincerely
06:13 i would not have been able to achieve uh
06:15 what i've been able to achieve had you
06:17 all not
06:18 been doing what you're doing um so this
06:20 is truly a team effort and it's it's i
06:22 think a mutual victory for all
06:24 well i thank you for that and uh
06:25 although you are being very humble i do
06:27 agree
06:28 it's absolutely a team effort now um
06:30 something you've been mentioning quite
06:31 frequently of late is the shift into
06:33 what you call second gear now you've
06:35 already hinted that this will involve
06:37 international engagement on the uap
06:39 issue and as a uk citizen i must admit
06:42 that i'm
06:43 somewhat disgruntled by the lack of
06:44 response both from my country's
06:46 government and our mainstream media
06:48 networks
06:49 so when it comes to addressing the uap
06:51 issue especially because there's
06:52 really been quite a significant radio
06:55 silence especially in the most recent
06:56 years
06:57 circa 2017 to present day where you've
07:00 had such a
07:00 elevated exponential increase in the
07:02 importance of this conversation
07:04 and yet there hasn't been much of a
07:06 headway over in my side of the pond and
07:08 so my first question to you is whether
07:09 or not
07:10 second gear and a transition to an
07:12 international conversation would involve
07:14 communication and data sharing
07:16 on the uap issue with specifically five
07:19 eyes alliance domains such as the uk
07:22 absolutely in fact i would i would i
07:25 would tell you that it's already
07:26 occurring
07:27 um i can't go too much more detail than
07:29 that but
07:30 uh you know we've had a long standing
07:33 relationship with our five eyes
07:34 partnerships and for those
07:36 those listening to your program for the
07:38 very first time may them on that
07:40 may not know what five eyes is um the
07:42 five eyes is the
07:44 historical relationship between the
07:45 united states and canada the uk
07:47 new zealand and australia and there has
07:50 been always a
07:51 very very close relationship our
07:53 countries have had with each other
07:55 historically
07:56 and as a result it's not uncommon for us
07:58 to share
07:59 uh national security related information
08:02 with each other and that construct
08:04 is under the um it's currently under the
08:07 the construct of the five eyes
08:09 um relationship so the question is are
08:12 we
08:13 sharing information with our five eyes
08:15 partners well yes we are
08:17 we always are um i think um
08:21 the question is to what degree are other
08:23 countries comfortable
08:25 in having this conversation publicly and
08:28 that's a that's a
08:29 that's a decision each country has to
08:31 make for themselves historically my
08:33 country's been in the same exact
08:34 situation as the uk uh you know nobody
08:37 really wanted to have a conversation
08:39 about this topic
08:40 for for quite a long time so uh i can
08:43 understand your frustration but
08:45 to be completely honest with you and
08:46 fair um i wouldn't i wouldn't blame the
08:49 uk government
08:50 right now um there's still a lot of
08:52 unknowns
08:54 and you know the the british are
08:56 notoriously always
08:58 very um risk perceptive
09:01 um they want to know all the
09:04 uh the potential pitfalls and and risks
09:07 involved
09:08 in something and and to some degree
09:10 that's that's actually kept
09:12 kept us alive in combat so um again i
09:16 understand the reticence um i guess my
09:18 my my advice to you be try not to to be
09:22 too disappointed i think
09:23 i think change is coming you've kind of
09:26 already answered this but i'll just
09:28 circle around just in case there's
09:29 anything else i can gleam out of it
09:30 during your career within atip were you
09:32 made aware of direct five eyes intel
09:34 sharing on specifically the uap
09:36 portfolio historically yes historically
09:40 okay thank you historically so moving on
09:43 something else one thing i find
09:45 curious is and this is regarding the
09:47 nimitz tic-tac
09:48 incident is that it was reported to have
09:51 jammed the pilot's radar now
09:52 due to the fact that pretty much all
09:54 other radar cases with uaps
09:56 show the uap has the ability to
09:58 seemingly appear on and off radar at
10:01 will
10:01 it makes the jamming seem almost
10:03 unnecessary moreover
10:04 considering the crafts performance level
10:07 and ability to outmaneuver the jets as
10:09 well as any
10:10 ordinance had there been any on board
10:12 why do you think it would need to jam
10:14 human radar well i think when we say jam
10:18 that's that's a misnomer
10:19 right i think probably the better better
10:22 response would be interfere
10:24 um because
10:27 we suspect now based upon the physics
10:29 that we're seeing
10:31 that it may not be an actual active
10:33 attempt to jam
10:34 what may actually be happening is that
10:37 it is uh
10:38 what what appears to be jamming is
10:40 really nothing more than a consequence
10:41 or an artifact if you will
10:43 of the object uh that we're seeing
10:47 right without going into a lot of detail
10:50 if you have
10:50 imagine looking at a imagine if you had
10:53 the ability
10:54 to to manipulate space-time
10:58 in a localized area okay around you
11:01 from the outside viewers perspective it
11:04 would be a little bit like looking at
11:05 koi fish in the bottom of a pond
11:07 uh you would see a distortion now
11:10 the object isn't really distorted but
11:13 because the
11:14 the the energy that is coming from the
11:18 sun
11:18 in the form of light energy like waves
11:22 what when it when it hits that localized
11:25 area what goes in is not necessarily
11:29 at the same frequency that goes out so
11:31 that's true not just with
11:32 sunlight but any type of electromagnetic
11:34 radiation
11:35 whether it be artificial like a radar
11:38 signature
11:39 or something as as as normal as natural
11:42 light
11:43 you would expect or anticipate to see a
11:45 bit of a distortion and in fact
11:48 if you will the more you have the
11:49 ability to
11:51 to manipulate space time in a localized
11:55 area
11:56 that picture sight picture would become
11:58 increasingly distorted think of a black
12:00 hole right
12:01 there's a reason why you can't see
12:03 inside of a black hole
12:04 and that's because you're looking at an
12:06 object that is that is truly warping
12:08 space-time
12:10 at the point of the the event horizon
12:13 physics almost becomes nonsensical
12:15 really and so
12:17 it is possible and i want to make sure
12:18 that i caveat here
12:21 i'm not saying this is the reason but if
12:24 you did have the ability to manipulate
12:25 space-time in a localized area to the
12:27 outside observer
12:29 um you could be uh you might experience
12:33 shifts uh doppler shifts um
12:36 in frequency and so i guess the the
12:38 long-winded answer to your question is
12:41 it may not be active jamming it may just
12:43 simply be uh
12:45 the fact of that byproduct a byproduct
12:48 right it may not be deliberate per se
12:50 okay you know one thing i really
12:52 appreciate about you lou is your
12:53 continuing presence and engagement with
12:55 ufo twitter now
12:57 you put out a series of tweets recently
12:59 one of which was addressing your recent
13:01 departure from to the stars academy of
13:03 arts and science and
13:04 you said the following the battle space
13:06 is constantly changing and so we must
13:08 evolve with it
13:09 dividing to conquer is an age-old tactic
13:12 we remain
13:13 close to our ttsa friends but sometimes
13:16 one must leave the regiment
13:17 to flank the enemy uap secrecy and so my
13:21 question
13:22 is if the enemy is uap secrecy does that
13:24 mean that you view
13:25 any potential gatekeepers of this
13:27 information who reside within either
13:29 government or the private sector as the
13:30 enemy and i only say this
13:32 because if the enemy is uap secrecy
13:34 which i agree with
13:35 then surely those responsible for
13:37 maintaining the secrecy should be viewed
13:39 as the opposition to those that are
13:40 demanding transparency
13:43 uh yes and no i i think it's an over
13:46 simplified
13:50 i think it's an over simplified way of
13:53 looking at things to simply say
13:55 the people that are behind this are the
13:58 enemy
13:58 i i think in some cases they feel
14:01 they're just doing their job
14:03 um i don't think there's a purpose
14:04 attempt purposeful attempt to deceive
14:06 the american people
14:08 i think probably when you get down to it
14:10 uh there may be a few that that
14:12 maybe feel that way but the vast
14:13 majority i don't believe feel that way i
14:15 think
14:16 i think they're trying to help the
14:17 american people and they believe that
14:20 that keeping this topic in the shadows
14:22 until we learn more
14:24 may be the prudent way forward i
14:26 personally disagree with that
14:28 but then again i could also be wrong and
14:30 only history will will be able to tell
14:32 if
14:33 if if our approach was a right approach
14:35 or not i i'm a
14:36 firm believer that government works for
14:39 the people
14:40 and as a result we have to trust the
14:43 people with that knowledge
14:44 uh whatever that knowledge may be
14:46 whether it's
14:47 uh north korean uh icbms
14:50 or a catastrophic pandemic like we're
14:53 dealing with now called covet
14:56 you know at a minimum the people deserve
14:58 to know the truth
14:59 whatever that truth is and i think the
15:00 same is true regarding this topic
15:03 of of uaps um i don't think
15:06 that the enemy are necessarily people
15:09 uh i think it the enemy is bureaucracy i
15:12 think the enemy is stigma i think the
15:14 enemy
15:15 is lack of transparency all the things
15:18 for which you're
15:19 you're fighting for in in in the uh ufo
15:22 twitter universe
15:23 to defeat um so
15:28 i don't know if i really answered that
15:29 question for you but again i i
15:31 i think the enemy is really
15:34 is is the over classification secrecy of
15:38 this topic
15:39 but again i i'm not sure i i i can go as
15:43 far as to blame any particular person on
15:45 it
15:45 um go ahead no i agree with you and i
15:49 appreciate that response
15:50 and shortly after the new york times
15:53 story back
15:54 in december 2017 you were on i'm pretty
15:56 sure it was cnn
15:58 when you said there is very compelling
16:00 evidence that we may not be alone
16:01 now you know that's not a statement that
16:03 makes room for a foreign adversary such
16:05 as russia or china a statement like that
16:07 cannot really be misinterpreted as
16:09 anything else other than
16:10 you hinting that we're not alone in this
16:12 universe can you tell us in any detail
16:14 what the compelling evidence for us not
16:16 being alone is that you were referring
16:18 to here was there anything specific that
16:20 you were thinking of at this time
16:23 uh yeah all my experience in atip
16:27 i mean until i i joined atip i didn't
16:29 even you know
16:30 i joked that i couldn't even spell ufo
16:33 let alone was i really involved with it
16:36 um
16:37 you know i think there was compelling
16:41 information not just for me but
16:43 everybody in the program that left
16:45 little room for doubt
16:46 of what was what was going on what we
16:48 were witnessing what we were
16:49 encountering and i think that's
16:51 for me um it was the most telling
16:56 you know at some point you spend your
16:57 life in the department of defense and
17:00 you're trained to recognize adversarial
17:03 aircraft and enemy aircraft and
17:05 technology and weapon systems
17:07 and when you come across something like
17:09 this it's
17:10 it's so far beyond
17:13 really any type of current paradigm uh
17:16 of
17:16 of this topic that
17:19 you kind of have to scratch your head
17:23 and say yourself what what's going on
17:25 here um
17:27 again i have to be careful because i
17:28 can't say exactly what
17:30 i was exposed to um but it was certainly
17:33 enough
17:34 uh for me anyways to to
17:37 feel compelled that this this this is a
17:39 topic that warrants additional
17:40 investigation and that's a very real
17:42 topic and it's it's
17:43 it's not our technology and it's it's
17:46 probably not some sort of foreign
17:48 adversarial technology either
17:50 well this kind of segues quite nicely
17:52 into what i wanted to ask next which is
17:54 that uh
17:54 dr eric davis has repeatedly stressed
17:57 the importance of the 38 defense
17:59 intelligence
18:00 reference documents from the precursor
18:02 program of atip known as orsap
18:04 for those that don't know that's the
18:05 advanced aerospace weapons systems
18:07 applications program
18:08 in terms of extrapolating the physics
18:11 and engineering of 2009 out to 2050 18:14 to determine whether or not the
18:15 americans can approximate the
18:17 capabilities of tic tacs or uap
18:19 in a scenario where the uaps might
18:21 become a future threat to the us
18:23 now eric davis talks about the 1977 18:26 calaras brazil case where ufos
18:29 purportedly utilized beams to kill
18:31 and injure people in the 1960s nasa
18:34 engineer dr paul hill
18:36 theorized about ufos employing heat
18:38 beams paralyzing beams force beams
18:41 and that the ufo propulsion or power
18:43 systems could be utilized as a weapon
18:46 and dr jack sarfati has theorized uap
18:49 having high frequency gravity weapons
18:51 capable of
18:52 disrupting aircraft weapon systems
18:54 jamming radars and communications and
18:56 affecting missile launch circuitry
18:58 emitting beams of gravity curvature that
19:00 range in power from that of an
19:02 electromagnetic pulse to
19:04 essentially tearing an f-18 apart my
19:07 question
19:07 is how realistic is the time frame given
19:10 by davis for the us military to achieve
19:12 these capabilities and also to convince
19:15 congress to allocate the money for
19:17 a huge manhattan project style effort to
19:19 get there
19:22 well that that timeline isn't up to me
19:24 that timeline is really up to
19:27 to you all uh and and the people
19:29 following this topic
19:30 um congress and our government is going
19:32 to respond
19:33 uh to to to the people
19:37 um if they feel that there is an
19:39 interest by the people to do
19:40 xyz then they're going to take the
19:43 lead the charge in doing that and making
19:45 sure it's properly resourced
19:47 um i to put it bluntly i think we're at
19:51 a point where
19:51 it's it's probably uh it's no longer a
19:54 theoretical
19:55 question whether or not this type of of
19:57 science is real and possible
19:59 uh i think it's not just a technical
20:02 challenge um and scalability
20:05 i i do i do believe that
20:09 uh that we now have a much better
20:11 understanding of the physics
20:13 and the mathematics based upon on our
20:16 our continued exploration into quantum
20:18 physics we're beginning to realize that
20:21 a lot of of the observations we're
20:23 seeing associated with uap
20:24 really are just rooted in advanced
20:26 physics
20:28 and i think that yeah the time will come
20:29 where we will be able to
20:31 uh to exploit that
20:35 i do have to ask that how realistic do
20:36 you think funding for such a
20:38 an endeavor would be given more
20:40 immediate and tangible threats presented
20:42 by near peer adversaries regional
20:44 troublemakers like north korea and iran
20:46 and also obviously the war on terror
20:48 uh can you reframe that question i want
20:50 to make sure that i i answered
20:51 succinctly so
20:52 yeah so um how how realistic would
20:55 funding for
20:56 something like you know building or
20:58 designing this technology and making
21:00 these breakthroughs
21:01 how likely would funding for that be
21:02 given that we've got quite immediate and
21:04 tangible
21:05 threats uh you know such as foreign
21:07 adversaries that we're concerned about
21:08 well let's let's look at the last time
21:10 the u.s uh
21:12 was in a similar situation in the world
21:14 um let's take uh
21:17 right after world war ii and the korean
21:19 war we had a lot going on and we had a
21:21 lot of civil unrest in this country and
21:23 we had a lot of
21:24 issues we were dealing with and yet we
21:26 still decided to put a man on the moon
21:28 and it took us 10 years but um
21:31 keep in mind just a decade before we
21:34 were still using aircraft
21:36 with propellers to fly across the ocean
21:39 and now we're talking about creating
21:41 spacecraft and putting a man on the moon
21:43 within a decade
21:45 i think when when we decide as a people
21:47 to do something
21:49 then all sorts of things are possible
21:51 let's not forget that out of the apollo
21:52 mission alone
21:54 something like 6 200 major innovations
21:58 were were invented and developed that
22:00 wound up actually benefiting mankind
22:03 and all this was a result of a
22:05 competition against the united states
22:06 and russia to see who was going to be
22:07 the first person
22:09 on the moon and as a result we have cat
22:11 scans and velcro and led lights and all
22:13 these other
22:14 innovations that we now take for granted
22:16 um you know in today's
22:18 day and age but uh these were
22:20 revolutionary approaches to problems
22:22 that
22:23 that helped advance society and so i
22:26 i think i think to answer that question
22:29 i think it's too early to answer that
22:31 question first of all because
22:33 we still need more data we need more
22:36 transparency
22:37 and we need more discussion and insight
22:41 but i think we're i think we're getting
22:43 closer
22:44 uh to having that conversation i think
22:46 the establishment of the uap task force
22:48 was a step in the right direction uh
22:50 towards that goal
22:52 uh of being able to put our time and
22:55 resources and talents
22:56 into this topic um so maybe i'm a little
22:59 bit more optimistic than
23:01 some when it when it comes to when it
23:03 comes to your question as far as
23:05 you know will the government ever
23:08 galvanize itself to to pursue this
23:11 endeavor
23:12 um i do i think once it accepts the
23:14 reality that these things are real
23:16 then it it it's almost
23:19 faded completely i can't see how they
23:22 they wouldn't if that makes sense
23:23 no i would like to channel your optimism
23:26 especially as a young guy as a 26 year
23:28 old
23:28 you know young man i would like to as
23:30 i've said before be
23:32 living this not talking about it in 10 23:34 years
23:35 well i i think we are i think we're i
23:37 think we're we're living it now i think
23:38 you're you're witnessing that i think
23:40 you're
23:40 you're part of that conversation
23:42 definitely definitely you're
23:44 you're you're making the difference the
23:45 very difference that that you want to
23:47 see happen
23:48 um you are you're doing it yourself and
23:51 i think that's that's incredible i think
23:53 that's
23:53 that's you know the fact that you and i
23:55 can even have this conversation about
23:56 this topic
23:57 yeah where three years ago people would
23:59 have thought that we should be
24:00 institutionalized i think is a
24:02 tremendous step forward absolutely
24:05 you and your listeners are are part of
24:06 that very much part of that equation
24:09 now you told tucker carlson in october
24:12 2019 that ttsa had obtained quite a bit
24:15 of material that might be
24:17 from such off-world crafts as have been
24:19 mentioned in
24:20 you know the new york times and such now
24:22 you said to quote
24:24 some of that material its providence is
24:26 frankly hearsay
24:27 whilst the provenance of other materials
24:29 has been substantiated
24:30 are you able to elaborate on this at all
24:32 are you saying that to the stars academy
24:34 was able to
24:34 prove that some of these materials that
24:36 they've examined are
24:37 not from this earth no what i said what
24:40 i was saying is that it's trying to
24:42 prove
24:43 there's a big difference between saying
24:44 proved and trying to prove
24:46 um it would be irresponsible of me to
24:49 to say anything has been proved because
24:52 prove requires peer review it requires
24:54 the
24:55 the scientific uh process of of peer
24:59 review
25:00 and replication et cetera et cetera et
25:01 cetera um
25:03 so we're not there yet i think we're
25:05 we're getting
25:06 closer but we're not there yet um
25:10 and you know keep in mind that's why we
25:12 had the the agreement with the crada
25:14 with with with the u.s government
25:17 because we realized
25:18 it can't just be a bunch of people
25:19 making a claim in the private world that
25:21 they've
25:21 they've they've come up with something
25:23 it has to be looked at and validated and
25:26 verified
25:27 by a cognizant authority and in this
25:30 particular case the us government
25:32 is probably best situated in this regard
25:36 to
25:37 to serve that purpose so obviously the
25:40 hope and the intent would be to have
25:41 someone
25:42 in the us government look over this uh
25:44 the material and the results as well
25:46 and and see what conclusions they come
25:48 up with
25:49 you might not be able to answer this but
25:50 um in regards to the crater do you think
25:53 that's still
25:54 going in a good direction for the
25:55 benefit of the public eventually or is
25:57 there any concerns that this might
25:59 kind of just stay in a little bit of a
26:00 black hole in the military
26:02 well our hope is that it doesn't stay as
26:04 a black hole in the military is it
26:06 possible sure
26:07 um but as more and more people become
26:10 aware and congress begins to
26:12 demand answers and action it gets
26:14 increasingly difficult
26:15 for it to stay in the shadows um it
26:18 it at some point you're going to have to
26:21 have that conversation with the elected
26:23 officials
26:24 and then they're going to have that
26:25 conversation with the american people so
26:28 uh while some people might say well yeah
26:30 that's just going to go back to where it
26:32 was
26:33 i don't think so i don't think we can
26:35 put the toothpaste
26:36 back in the proverbial too at this point
26:38 i think we've come too far
26:40 and the conversation is being had
26:45 dr eric davis once stated that during
26:47 his time
26:48 in atip he located the reverse
26:50 engineering programs holding the craft
26:52 and if they had been able to get access
26:54 to the program then they would have
26:56 dramatically increased their
26:57 understanding
26:58 during your time as the director of atip
27:00 did you locate programs that were
27:01 working on the reverse engineering of
27:03 non-terrestrial vehicles
27:06 uh i can't answer that question
27:08 unfortunately
27:09 that's fine no problem no i remember
27:14 vague but i i i can't answer that
27:17 question
27:17 in all honesty that's answer enough lou
27:19 i remember the former deputy assistant
27:21 secretary of defense for intelligence
27:23 christopher mellon once mentioned how
27:25 there is a chance that he was not
27:26 informed on everything regarding the uap
27:28 portfolio during his time in government
27:31 how concerned are you about the
27:32 potential subversion
27:34 of legal oversight and government
27:36 authority on this issue due to the
27:38 possibility
27:39 of the uap portfolio essentially being
27:41 hidden within the confines of private
27:43 industry
27:46 that's always a concern you know there's
27:48 people that that don't want to have the
27:50 conversation they don't want to
27:52 they don't want to talk about
27:57 maybe the progress or or lack thereof
27:59 that's been made um
28:00 there's i think also a lot of fear as
28:02 well um that's why we need to rather
28:05 than
28:05 villainize individuals who may have been
28:07 part of some sort of legacy effort
28:09 i think what we need to do is uh help
28:12 them
28:13 help them have the conversation real
28:15 recognizing that
28:16 look they were just doing your job at
28:17 the time we don't need to
28:19 villainize anybody and uh you know maybe
28:23 the answer is to some degree you know i
28:26 hate to use the word offer some sort of
28:28 immunity but
28:29 you know in a very vague sense you know
28:32 give them the ability to have a
28:33 conversation without fear of retribution
28:35 or reprisal
28:36 um and then uh you know slowly have that
28:39 conversation
28:40 uh with with the american people as well
28:44 i would i would personally be fully
28:45 behind any anything that would allow
28:47 you know these things to come out as and
28:49 without risking like you said the
28:51 the livelihoods or or anything of these
28:53 people that have been involved because
28:54 you know you are correct a lot of these
28:56 people if not most if not all
28:58 are in their own mind serving their
29:00 country and doing their job
29:02 and uh i don't i don't think i'm not one
29:04 of those people that personally believes
29:06 in you know hooded
29:07 cackling people in in a room who are
29:09 trying to uh who are trying to trick us
29:11 all with this i think that it's a lot
29:12 more they're not
29:13 i can tell you that is absolutely not
29:14 the case yeah that's not the case at all
29:16 there's no one in there that's purposely
29:18 trying to
29:20 to to hurt the world hurt the american
29:22 people
29:23 you know try to fool them try to play
29:25 gotcha that's just
29:27 conspiracy theory stuff uh yeah that
29:30 really doesn't have any basis
29:31 in in reality um
29:34 yeah what do you what are your thoughts
29:36 on the leaked transcripts that came from
29:38 the estate of the late apollo 14 29:40 astronaut edgar mitchell that suggests a
29:42 meeting took place between
29:44 dr eric w davis and the 13th director of
29:46 the dia amongst other flag ranks admiral
29:49 thomas r wilson
29:50 wherein a scenario is described that
29:52 involve the admiral being
29:54 essentially blacklisted from programs
29:56 relating to ufo reverse engineering due
29:58 to not meeting the criteria
30:00 of what was called the bigots list which
30:02 is apparently
30:03 a closely selected list of individuals
30:05 and if you do not meet their briefing
30:07 criteria
30:08 regardless of oversight authority or
30:10 possession of the correct tickets
30:11 you will not be read into the program
30:13 can i get your thoughts on what is known
30:15 as the admiral wilson leaks do you
30:16 believe this leaked transcript is
30:18 describing a real incident
30:20 uh well this kind of goes back first of
30:22 all to your question about chris mellon
30:24 and him saying that you know he never
30:26 had it he never
30:28 was briefed onto the program while he
30:29 was inside and that's a problem
30:32 uh a lot of programs exist and not
30:34 everybody is going to be
30:36 briefed to or have access to a program
30:40 that's just the way our government works
30:41 and and we accept that
30:43 uh when we when we work for the
30:45 government with that said
30:48 i it specifically relates to the admiral
30:51 wilson
30:52 uh documents and the alleged uh uh
30:54 meetings that transpired
30:55 i can't i can't discuss that i i wasn't
30:58 around for that that occurred
31:00 uh well before my tenure
31:03 in a tip and any speculation on my part
31:07 probably would be um it would
31:10 it would not be it wouldn't be
31:13 necessarily accurate
31:14 because i i i don't know i wasn't there
31:17 um
31:18 you know be pure it'd be speculative and
31:20 although it's it's maybe fun sometimes
31:22 to speculate about things
31:24 i i'm not sure in this particular case
31:26 um it would be very helpful
31:28 um i i would simply tell you from my
31:30 perspective uh
31:32 you know probably ask ask the
31:35 individuals involved
31:36 would be would be my suggestion oh
31:38 believe me i'm trying
31:40 now um it's something that you might
31:43 have been involved in because i have
31:44 heard that this is true
31:46 chris bledsoe on record with richard
31:48 dolan once said that his case was the
31:50 very first case
31:51 undertaken by the atip program now i
31:53 know that you have met with chris a
31:55 couple of times but are you able to
31:56 comment on this claim at all and confirm
31:58 whether or not that's accurate
32:01 um you know i i don't want to get back
32:04 into he said she said stuff
32:05 um you know i i would probably if
32:09 i would probably say that was more
32:10 awesome related right okay um
32:13 you know a tip was was very much focused
32:16 on the nuts and bolts
32:17 that could also be that could be me
32:19 messing up the quote
32:21 he may have said whatsapp so just for
32:22 the record for everyone listening that
32:24 could be my mistake
32:26 yeah i just you know i want to be
32:27 careful not to to
32:29 say something definitive um you know
32:32 from from my perspective that that
32:34 probably
32:34 would be more appropriately uh handled
32:37 into the asap
32:38 uh at the time rather than
32:41 no problem at all um you mentioned in
32:42 your recent interview on the platform
32:44 that ufo podcast
32:46 that you are having to tiptoe right on
32:48 the very edge in fact you said one
32:50 wrong word and i will be over the edge
32:52 and this is in regards to what you can
32:54 and can't say now
32:55 obviously we understand that you're
32:57 beholden to your non-disclosure
32:58 agreements but since you've stepped out
33:00 into the public arena have you been
33:02 warned by members of the u.s government
33:04 not to go beyond a particular line in
33:06 the sand when it comes to discussing
33:08 specifically the us government's own
33:09 involvement and knowledge of the ufo
33:12 issue
33:13 well yeah i mean that's that's the
33:14 purpose of the nda you are acknowledging
33:16 up front what your left and right limits
33:18 are uh
33:19 you know you're you're reminded that on
33:21 a close and continuing basis
33:24 um especially when you have an active
33:25 security clearance you know i'm still
33:27 required to
33:28 to report uh routinely and regularly to
33:32 to government security officers if i
33:34 suspect that there's been some sort of
33:36 security violation so
33:38 for me it's um there's a constant
33:41 reminder
33:41 now i think what you're asking me is
33:43 having been warned
33:45 uh perhaps in a little bit more direct
33:47 sort of way by
33:48 by government minders that may still be
33:51 involved
33:51 in the in the in the effort and is that
33:54 is that correct is that what
33:55 you're asking me well by all means you
33:57 can answer that
34:00 uh you know i have to be very careful
34:03 um you know i have to be very cautious
34:06 how i how i proceed
34:07 with this endeavor um you know i
34:12 i haven't been pulled into someone's
34:14 office and read the right act
34:16 if that's what you mean but but i have
34:18 been
34:19 reminded on on a regular basis that i
34:21 need to
34:22 be uh cognizant of what's at stake
34:25 and uh and um you know
34:28 make sure i do things in a constructive
34:30 way not a destructive way
34:32 and that makes sense i mean i don't i
34:34 don't i'm not trying to blow up the
34:36 process i'm just
34:37 trying to get the conversation going
34:39 knowing what
34:40 what what i saw and what i had access to
34:42 in the atic program
34:44 there's got to be a way to have that
34:46 conversation at an unclassified level
34:48 uh and and get people involved
34:51 um because i think this is a topic that
34:54 doesn't belong under the providence of
34:56 any particular country organization or
34:59 or institution
35:02 this is a topic that involves all of
35:03 humanity and as a result we need to
35:06 probably have that conversation you know
35:08 as as a species
35:11 and i appreciate that response and i
35:13 agree with you as well and because
35:14 there's a
35:15 i'm sure you're aware well i know you're
35:16 aware because you have addressed it
35:18 before in interviews but
35:19 there are a lot of people that consider
35:20 some of the narratives coming from well
35:22 obviously previously now
35:24 uh from ttsa uh you know regarding the
35:26 threat narrative and
35:27 and you know a lot of people there's
35:29 kind of a split into different camps
35:31 where
35:31 you know some really do feel that
35:34 there's just this
35:35 threat narrative being driven and that's
35:37 a conspiracy and that you know this it's
35:38 all a psychological operation but i have
35:40 to admit that i've always
35:42 thought of it as more about the fact
35:43 that you can't really go into
35:46 the department of defense and say okay
35:49 so there's these you know beings and
35:50 there are space brothers and we should
35:52 be
35:52 you know getting on with them they kick
35:54 you straight out of the department of
35:55 defense you have to go in with the idea
35:56 of
35:57 threats incursions over sensitive sites
35:59 and the kind of language that the
36:00 bureaucracy responds to and i always saw
36:03 you and christopher mellon and jim
36:05 semivan as people that were essentially
36:07 utilizing your knowledge within the us
36:09 government bureaucracy
36:11 and uh flipping it back on itself and
36:13 addressing it and making it face
36:15 basically making it look in the mirror
36:16 and say look we have these tangible
36:18 threats these issues these incursions
36:20 it needs to be addressed and so for me i
36:22 never really did feel like i saw a major
36:24 threat narrative
36:25 but would i be right in saying that
36:27 really it's just bureaucratic engagement
36:28 using the correct language
36:30 you know you have to know the system if
36:34 you want the system
36:35 to react right you have to know
36:38 what levers to pull if you want to get a
36:41 certain reaction and the department of
36:44 defense
36:45 it's in its very title it's the
36:47 department of defense it's not the
36:48 department of humanitarian assistance
36:50 it's not the department of space
36:52 exploration
36:54 it is the department of defense um by
36:57 virtue of its of of its
36:58 design it is a national security
37:00 apparatus
37:02 that has been designed to fight and win
37:04 wars
37:05 decisively by the way and violently if
37:07 necessary
37:08 so with that in context
37:12 i don't think it should be much of a
37:13 surprise for people to
37:16 to to recognize that
37:20 if you want the department of defense to
37:22 look at something it has to
37:24 look at it from the lens or the aperture
37:27 of a perceived threat
37:28 and without scaring people
37:31 and saying you know this is an absolute
37:34 threat um
37:36 you know the the the approach we take is
37:39 the approach that any
37:40 any prudent mother or father would do
37:42 right um
37:44 you're going into a new area and with
37:46 your child a new playground
37:48 and the first thing they want to do is
37:50 just run on all the equipment and and
37:52 have fun
37:53 well what's the first thing you do you
37:54 inspect the equipment before they play
37:56 on it
37:57 and then you talk to them say okay now
37:59 listen please be careful you know i
38:01 don't want you going on the top part of
38:02 the slide i don't want you doing this or
38:04 i do want you doing that
38:05 uh that's that's important um that's
38:08 prudent and i don't think there's
38:10 anything wrong with that and i think
38:11 when it comes to this
38:13 to to a potential threat look i i'm
38:16 i'm under the the presumption that
38:18 anything and everything can be a threat
38:19 until we can prove it's not um that's
38:23 that's the world i come from uh again
38:25 not trying to fear monger
38:27 but that's the reality and you know when
38:29 people say well you know i'm an
38:31 experiencer quote-unquote experiencer
38:33 and i've
38:33 you know i'm here to tell you that that
38:35 it's it's benevolent
38:37 my response to that is how do you know
38:40 that's your experience and by the way if
38:42 from the world i come from if if i'm
38:45 taken away uh against my free will
38:50 that's called kidnapping that's i i i
38:53 i it's that's that's no different than
38:56 taking a hostage and holding someone
38:57 hostage
38:58 uh or if i god forbid i touch you
39:01 without your permission
39:03 that's assault and i don't understand
39:07 why it's so hard for people to grasp
39:09 that you know
39:11 maybe you think it's okay for that to
39:13 happen but i don't
39:15 i don't want anybody touching me or
39:18 taking me somewhere or my family
39:20 without my explicit permission period
39:23 full stop
39:24 and i think it's i think it is a
39:27 reckless
39:29 i think it's a reckless
39:33 perspective to um
39:37 for us to just go down that road that
39:39 everything is going to be hunky-dory and
39:41 that there's a species out there if
39:43 there is
39:44 that has significantly greater
39:45 technology and capabilities as us
39:47 we're just going to go ahead and trust
39:48 them you know again that may sound
39:52 good for some people but i'm not that
39:55 way
39:55 i think we need to approach it very
39:57 cautiously look when we go
39:58 scuba diving uh yeah you go down there's
40:01 a lot of fish to see a lot of pretty
40:02 fish
40:03 on the coral reef but you know what
40:04 there's also sharks um
40:06 and by the way a threat doesn't have to
40:08 be intentional it can be unintentional
40:10 you know i tell people all the time if i
40:12 go to an airport and i and i i get too
40:14 close to a
40:15 you know 747 about to take off
40:18 chances are you know i'm going to have
40:20 some significant
40:22 uh biological issues i'm gonna go death
40:24 uh i'll lose my hearing i'm gonna get
40:26 burned from the from the exhaust
40:28 it's not necessarily a direct deliberate
40:30 threat but it's an indirect threat
40:33 nonetheless and one that needs to be
40:35 recognized so
40:36 i think at a minimum we need to
40:38 understand the technology more
40:40 uh and and proceed cautiously again i'm
40:44 not
40:44 i'm not saying it is or isn't a threat
40:48 but look at the background i come from
40:50 is it really that much of a surprise
40:51 that
40:52 being an intelligence career
40:53 intelligence officer and department of
40:55 defense as well
40:56 that i look at things not as a threat
40:59 that's that's
41:01 i think i think people just need to
41:03 understand the world i come from and the
41:05 world we're
41:06 in and then maybe they can better
41:08 appreciate our tactic and by the way no
41:10 i don't think for the record just to
41:12 clear this up i don't think
41:13 that the things are necessarily a direct
41:15 threat but i also don't want to take the
41:16 chance
41:17 and so i'm going to do my due diligence
41:19 to continue to to try to figure that out
41:22 well following along the same line of a
41:24 threat and and how a country's defense
41:26 apparatus should perhaps respond to this
41:28 in a recent white paper written by a
41:31 colleague and friend of mine frank
41:32 milburn published on the beginning sadat
41:34 center for strategic studies frank
41:36 asked dr sarfati if a tic-tac with its
41:39 surrounding field
41:40 would be susceptible to weapons like
41:42 surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles
41:44 aircraft cannon lasers railguns emp
41:47 devices or even
41:48 nuclear warheads that were detonated in
41:50 proximity to a uap
41:52 sarfati theorized that if the warp field
41:55 surrounding the uap
41:56 is strong enough it could essentially
41:58 create and i'll quote
41:59 jack here a white hole artificial event
42:02 horizon
42:03 generated by the meta material which
42:05 would prevent anything from penetrating
42:07 no matter how powerful the energy
42:09 associated with the weapon used against
42:11 the tic tac was
42:13 now if that's correct then this would
42:15 mean more advanced weapons being
42:17 developed like lasers and rail guns
42:19 are already obsolete except for against
42:21 near peer adversaries
42:23 it is this not then an even better
42:25 argument for development of offensive
42:27 and defensive uap technology
42:30 essentially in order to mitigate the
42:31 threats presented by both
42:33 our adversaries and the operators of uap
42:36 and especially to get there first before
42:37 china or russia do
42:40 well i mean sure first of all you asked
42:44 me to comment
42:44 on on mr sofrate's um
42:48 physics model so unfortunately i'm not a
42:50 physicist so
42:51 i i'm not sure i really can do that i
42:54 can't i can't tell you
42:55 uh the validity of his scientific
42:59 modeling
43:00 um and whether something is or is not
43:02 impenetrable
43:03 and whatnot um i'm certainly not
43:05 qualified for that
43:07 but if there is something out there that
43:09 displays
43:11 extremely advanced uh extremely
43:14 advanced capabilities uh whether it's a
43:17 weapon system or propulsion
43:19 you know i i'm i think there is a
43:23 potential threat there are countries out
43:24 there we know that are a fact that if
43:26 they had a strategic advantage on us
43:28 they would use those um in an
43:32 irresponsible way
43:34 they would use them probably as a weapon
43:36 of war rather than
43:37 a weapon of peace and so uh as a result
43:40 of that i think um
43:42 i think it's it's it's it's incumbent
43:45 upon us to do our due diligence
43:47 to make sure that uh if this technology
43:50 is viable
43:51 it does not get into the wrong hands um
43:53 that would be my suggestion
43:55 and uh we need to now what does that
43:58 mean right i mean people could say well
44:00 you know you guys in the united states
44:01 have had a history too sometimes being
44:03 abusive and
44:04 you know not using technology very very
44:07 right in a very nice way
44:09 and the response to that is you're
44:10 absolutely right you're absolutely right
44:12 um you know i'm not sure
44:15 what the solution really is and this is
44:18 why it's so important that we have a
44:19 conversation
44:20 at the macro level with our elected
44:22 officials
44:23 um and and by the way it is the people
44:26 that need to drive that conversation
44:28 that's very very important and i think
44:30 in you know
44:31 until we're able to do that uh we're
44:33 still going to be asking these things
44:34 fundamental questions
44:36 um you know i i don't want this
44:39 technology getting in the hands of an
44:40 adversary
44:41 i also don't want to get into the hands
44:43 of somebody irresponsible in my own
44:44 country
44:45 right right and this is why the more
44:48 transparency we have by people
44:50 the harder it is for that to happen we
44:53 begin
44:53 to to
44:57 we begin to have visibility into this
44:59 area
45:00 in a manner that makes it very very
45:02 tough for anybody to get away with
45:04 anything
45:04 you know sneaky now i'm gonna i'm gonna
45:07 segue into something completely
45:09 different here but something that
45:10 fascinates me
45:11 is the undeniable overlap between secret
45:14 societies
45:15 occult practices and the phenomenon a
45:17 notable example of this comes from one
45:19 of the pioneers of the american rocketry
45:22 program jack parsons
45:23 who was not only a genius rocket
45:25 engineer but also a devotee to the 20th
45:27 century english magician and occult
45:29 leader alastair crowley and his religion
45:31 of
45:32 thelema alongside the occult ties and
45:34 beliefs of the americans who built the
45:36 foundations of what would become nasa
45:39 you also have the undeniable occult ties
45:41 that can be found within the nazi party
45:43 especially within the inner sanctums of
45:45 the ss now
45:46 taking into consideration operation
45:48 paperclip where the americans and
45:50 russians were
45:51 fighting over getting the brightest of
45:53 the nazi scientists after the war
45:55 and the fact that high-level ss members
45:57 became a part of the american rocketry
45:59 program
46:00 is it fair to say that nasa was built
46:02 almost entirely if not
46:04 entirely by practicing members of the
46:06 occult both
46:07 from the american side and from the nazi
46:09 side that were brought over via
46:11 paperclip
46:13 well that's that's a really good
46:14 question um
46:16 let me see if i can dissect that a
46:18 little bit uh please i know it's quite a
46:20 big one i'm sorry
46:21 no no that's good um occult
46:25 and and conspiracy theories um
46:28 and whatnot are usually uh are usually
46:32 originate uh in the vacuum of knowledge
46:35 um and they leave room for speculation
46:37 and so belief now
46:38 takes the place of of fact and uh
46:42 belief isn't necessarily fact sometimes
46:44 it is sometimes it isn't
46:46 and so in this particular case um you
46:48 know i think
46:50 when you look at our country's history
46:53 uh to including our founding fathers
46:55 there were always organizations and
46:57 groups that
46:58 influenced our our country to include
47:01 our constitution
47:03 back then it was the masons in fact if
47:04 you look at the freemasons if you were
47:06 to look at
47:07 the entire blueprint of uh washington dc
47:11 we owe a lot of that and architecture
47:13 yeah uh
47:14 to the contributions of the freemasons
47:16 now that's not a bad thing you know
47:17 they're not a disruptive force and of
47:19 course some people can say well that's
47:20 not a call i'm not saying it's a cult
47:22 i'm just saying
47:23 there's a long deep rich history of
47:25 countries in particular all countries
47:27 frankly not just the united states of
47:29 being influenced from time to time by
47:31 outside groups
47:33 that have specific agendas some of those
47:35 agendas are good some of those agendas
47:36 are not so good
47:38 but it's nothing new and so when you say
47:40 nasa uh
47:41 you know has been influenced by by the
47:45 occult
47:46 my simple response is well of course it
47:48 has but it's not just nasa
47:50 it's it's a lot of institutions even our
47:52 military when you look at our rank
47:54 structure and the symbols that we use
47:55 for
47:56 right right for kernels and whatnot i
47:58 mean symbolism is everywhere look at the
48:00 american dollar bill right i mean look
48:01 at the american flag
48:03 there are symbols and everything that we
48:05 have military
48:06 heraldry people's people's family crest
48:09 is is to some degree uh in in the same
48:12 way
48:12 it's it's it's your tradition and that
48:16 symbols mean something i think the
48:19 problem is is
48:20 when you allow uh
48:24 though when you when you allow any
48:25 organization that's based upon
48:27 faith and belief um to
48:30 drive um the decisions
48:34 and the results of scientific endeavors
48:37 that's when i i have a problem with
48:39 it but the fact that nasa during
48:42 operation paperclip
48:44 uh recruited a bunch of folks and some
48:46 for the from the german ananerva
48:48 program that that doesn't really bother
48:51 me um
48:52 you know i i i know it sounds a little
48:55 bizarre for some people
48:57 um i think we need to be cautious and
49:00 careful that we don't allow
49:02 certain influences uh to to outside to
49:06 to influence um the decisions being made
49:10 on the inside based upon
49:11 only you know trust or faith
49:15 um i think that's where that's the role
49:17 of science um
49:19 you know i'm always careful with
49:20 conspiracy theories because
49:22 you know most conspiracy theories have
49:24 some sort of truth to them
49:26 there's there's a there's a baseline
49:27 truth um the problem is is that you take
49:30 that truth and you you have one percent
49:32 true and
49:33 then you stretch it with 99 and
49:36 that's that's
49:37 that's where it becomes dangerous well
49:39 the reason i the reason i asked it was
49:41 because i was wondering if
49:43 it bore any relevance to your own issues
49:44 within the department of defense when it
49:46 came to beliefs from high-ranking
49:47 members of the government that these
49:49 beings represented a demonic force and
49:51 should not even be acknowledged let
49:52 alone studied i was wondering if this
49:54 current belief that's being held by
49:56 high-ranking members of america's
49:57 defense intelligence
49:59 bureaucracy is a belief that's been
50:01 bolstered by the occult history of
50:03 america's space program
50:06 uh no it's it's that happened because
50:09 of religion um there were
50:12 the the what we were doing in atip in
50:14 early days of all sap
50:16 was um was really challenging some
50:19 people's
50:20 uh personal theological positions
50:23 uh it wasn't because of if you will
50:28 ananerva or anything like that you know
50:30 the cult like that influencing
50:33 uh decision makers within the pentagon
50:35 it was far
50:36 more mundane and
50:39 common it was it was organized religion
50:41 in this particular case
50:42 but you know i also have to be careful
50:44 because people say well are you saying
50:45 organized religion is the enemy no it's
50:47 not you know i'm a man of faith myself
50:51 i just think we have to be very careful
50:53 how we proceed with things
50:56 you know when we introduce our own
50:58 personal bias
51:00 into into the calculus of science
51:04 we always have to be mindful of that and
51:07 again i'm not saying in this particular
51:09 case that religion was bad because i had
51:11 a lot of people in atip
51:12 that were very religious and it did not
51:14 affect our ability to run
51:16 to run the program um
51:19 so you know i guess it's i mean it's a
51:23 really good question
51:24 a question that probably would take us
51:25 another hour to discuss
51:27 um because we're talking about game if
51:29 you like
51:30 people uh we're getting into the psyche
51:35 of of what it means to be human yeah and
51:37 our fears
51:38 and our bias and our likes and dislikes
51:41 um but no it wasn't anything cultish
51:44 that
51:44 that interfered with us it was it was
51:48 it was um it was us it was our own our
51:50 own people
51:52 now i i truly believe that there is a
51:54 necessary symbiosis required between
51:57 physics and what we can call metaphysics
51:59 what would you say to
52:00 a newtonian material reductionist
52:03 scientist who considers the human
52:05 being to be a mechanical mechanism
52:07 within essentially a dead universe
52:09 where consciousness is a generated bio
52:11 effect of complex neural connections and
52:14 nothing more would you agree with this
52:15 or do you have a differing viewpoint
52:19 no i i have a much different viewpoint
52:21 um
52:22 you know let me give you a case in point
52:24 you can have
52:26 a human being can survive without
52:29 uh you can have a double amputee uh
52:32 and sir or quadruplegic even and and and
52:35 survive without limbs uh just fine
52:38 um so the body itself doesn't really
52:40 define who we are as a human being
52:42 the body is a is a life support
52:44 mechanism it's a spaceship if you will
52:47 for what what's inside and then you have
52:49 individuals uh
52:51 you have the brain which has a neural
52:53 synapses and a lot of brains
52:54 look very similar when you take a
52:56 particular cat scan and you look at one
52:58 brain to another human brain
53:00 you know you have a lot of commonalities
53:03 you have optical lobes
53:04 the cerebrum cerebellum and medulla
53:08 so there's a lot of commonalities so
53:10 it's probably
53:12 not the brain and probably not the body
53:14 that defines what a human being is
53:17 and just a collection of neural synapses
53:19 otherwise a computer would be defined as
53:20 a human being
53:21 a computer now is getting to the point
53:23 in complexity where where the pathways
53:25 although silicon and not carbon
53:27 are getting equally as as complex as a
53:29 human brain in fact we can even teach it
53:31 to learn through
53:32 through artificial intelligence right
53:34 right that's not what defines the human
53:35 being
53:36 and um you know there is there's another
53:39 aspect
53:40 and some have called it a soul or an id
53:42 or the chi
53:43 or you know whatever whatever you want
53:45 to call it but there's something that
53:47 that most people feel is an indelible
53:50 part of the human being
53:52 that is not necessarily contained within
53:55 the body or the mind
53:57 and that could be you know a lot of
53:59 scientists now are looking and exploring
54:01 the idea the notion that human
54:02 consciousness is really
54:04 a quantum process in quantum physics
54:07 and you know it could very well be you
54:10 know that our brains are our quantum
54:11 computers and if that's the case
54:14 and that re if that is really the case
54:16 then there may be a fundamental part of
54:18 the human being
54:19 um that is not necessarily locked into a
54:23 three-dimensional world
54:24 yeah and a linear function of time um
54:28 well i i honestly agree 100 with that
54:30 it's it's
54:31 something that i've thought of myself
54:34 over time is that the human being could
54:36 potentially be
54:37 some form of biological quantum computer
54:39 and you know it can interact with the
54:41 feel of consciousness in a lot of
54:42 different ways we're just tuned into one
54:44 frequency
54:45 but something i wanted to ask as well is
54:46 um what areas of
54:48 innovation do you currently see
54:49 happening in the world that you believe
54:51 will bring us closer to the answers
54:52 regarding
54:53 both consciousness and also uap because
54:55 these things are connected
54:57 what i mean by that is are there any
54:58 specific areas that you feel people
54:59 should be focusing their attention on
55:01 whether this be physics technology or
55:03 something else what are you paying
55:04 attention to personally when it comes to
55:06 human innovation
55:07 and an increased understanding of the
55:09 uap issue
55:12 wow um you know what i don't want to
55:14 prejudice a jury i think everybody
55:16 should
55:17 should explore on their own um i do have
55:20 areas
55:20 of focus that i tend to to pay attention
55:23 to a little bit more than others but
55:25 um that's really kind of irrelevant um
55:29 because what i may be focusing on may
55:32 not necessarily be uh
55:35 what other people should focus on so
55:39 and i know that's not very helpful uh
55:42 you know keep an open mind yeah okay
55:45 good advice
55:46 we need we need more data and anything
55:48 is possible
55:49 um everything all options are on the
55:51 table until they're not
55:53 yeah and you know try not to to go down
55:56 the rabbit hole of jumping to
55:57 conclusions prematurely and saying oh
55:58 this is the answer for sure
56:01 because that can be as equally as
56:03 destructive as
56:04 as you know not asking any questions at
56:06 all but
56:08 um that'd be my that'd be my advice keep
56:10 an open mind continue to pursue
56:12 ask questions question everything
56:15 question everybody
56:16 uh there's there's nothing wrong with
56:18 that that's that's what we're supposed
56:20 to do
56:20 and if anybody gets upset with feels for
56:23 example threatened
56:24 about the questioning well maybe they
56:28 don't
56:29 know their facts as well as they should
56:32 because you shouldn't feel threatened by
56:34 by anybody asking you a question
56:37 i i think this is where we we run the
56:39 the problem of people having these
56:41 preconceived notions and narratives
56:43 already kind of cooked and
56:44 and they spent so much time uh
56:47 developing these ideas that they become
56:49 married to them and in some cases they
56:50 start profiting from them
56:52 and once that happens it's really very
56:55 hard to back yourself out of that
56:59 something i really wanted to touch on um
57:01 and thank you for that because i
57:03 absolutely
57:03 resonate and agree with what you were
57:05 saying there um something i wanted to
57:06 touch on is the infamous
57:07 slide nine that was discovered by a
57:09 fellow researcher also called jay
57:11 creator of the platform the mind sublime
57:13 who discovered on christopher mellon's
57:15 webpage an a-tip
57:16 presentation slide which included within
57:19 it some pretty disturbing conclusions
57:21 this is what the presentation slide said
57:23 the science exists for an enemy of the
57:25 united states to manipulate
57:27 both physical and cognitive environments
57:29 in order to penetrate us
57:31 facilities influence decision makers and
57:33 compromise national security the slide
57:36 then goes on to list the applications of
57:38 this science which includes psychotronic
57:40 weapons penetration of solid surfaces
57:42 alteration or manipulation of biological
57:44 organisms
57:45 instantaneous sensor disassembly unique
57:48 cognitive human interface experiences
57:50 and one of the most disturbing and
57:52 intriguing
57:53 anomalies in the space-time construct
57:55 now this slide if i'm correct
57:57 is essentially saying that a science or
57:59 technology exists that would allow for
58:01 the complete and total manipulation of
58:03 both cognitive
58:04 and physical environments including the
58:06 manipulation of the very fabric of space
58:08 time itself is that correct
58:12 i think that's a pretty fair assessment
58:14 right so
58:15 this slide also mentions how the
58:17 department of defense has been involved
58:20 in similar experiments in the past and
58:22 has relationships with renowned subject
58:24 matter experts finishing off by saying
58:26 that
58:26 the dod controls several facilities
58:28 where activities have been detected now
58:31 many credible investigators and
58:32 government insiders have alluded to the
58:34 participation of united states special
58:36 forces engaging
58:38 in psychological warfare testing
58:40 operations on u.s soldiers some have
58:42 even claimed that perhaps these
58:43 activities were responsible for a
58:45 portion of the
58:46 alleged uap sightings over nuclear
58:48 facilities
58:49 and may have been conducted as
58:50 penetration tests under the purview of a
58:53 top secret programme
58:54 one proponent of this theory is dr jack
58:56 vallee in fact he has been a
58:58 long-standing proponent of this idea in
59:00 various capacities over the years
59:02 hypothesizing that man-made illusions
59:04 have in fact been behind a number of
59:06 famous cases over the years stating
59:08 further that he has met special forces
59:10 veterans
59:11 who have admitted as much in a fairly
59:13 recent interview
59:14 dr jack vallee stated that the famous
59:17 rendelsham forest incident which took
59:19 place in the uk
59:20 was quote simply too similar to other
59:22 psychological warfare exercises i am
59:25 familiar with
59:26 for me to jump to the conclusion that it
59:28 was a ufo now
59:29 as i understand it illusions like this
59:32 may actually be possible
59:33 utilizing for instance holography towers
59:36 and geoparabelic test beds on
59:39 land that is rich in chromium ore the
59:42 idea goes back all the way
59:44 to world war ii with the successful
59:46 tactics of psychological warfare against
59:48 the germans
59:49 in the form of phantom armies on the
59:51 ground and phantom fighter planes in the
59:53 sky
59:54 the concept also stems to things like
59:56 operation bluebeam
59:58 and even alleged false indication and
60:00 warnings
60:02 now you sir with both an extensive
60:04 background in the special forces as well
60:06 as heading up
60:07 atip would appear to be an ideal
60:10 candidate to speak on this topic one may
60:12 even be forgiven for feeling that you
60:14 would have a need to know
60:16 on this now with that said are you aware
60:18 of any
60:19 extraterrestrial uap related tests
60:22 ever having been perpetrated against the
60:25 united states military
60:27 or the civilian population
60:30 by americans by by the american
60:33 government
60:33 or yes or by another foreign adversary
60:36 human
60:38 uh not by the american government at all
60:42 okay um that's that's
60:45 i'm pretty confident of that because
60:48 there's there's things that we have to
60:49 deal with in the intelligence world
60:51 people don't
60:52 realize that we're bound by law okay
60:55 there's something called a procedure 15 60:57 uh which is violation which is uh
61:00 basic basically involving questionable
61:03 intelligence activities
61:04 and we do not have the ability
61:08 to conduct experiments uh because in the
61:11 past we did
61:12 we had things like the electric kool-aid
61:13 acid test and we had done some
61:15 pretty nasty things including uh the
61:17 syphilis
61:19 where we as a government participated
61:21 into some pretty abhorrent
61:23 uh activities um very
61:26 terrible effect so as a result of that
61:29 um laws were made to to prohibit that
61:32 from ever happening again
61:34 and that is a result of
61:38 abuses that occurred in the past so i
61:40 think in today's day and age it would be
61:42 exceedingly unlikely for
61:46 anybody in the us government apparatus
61:48 to be conducting
61:50 tests like this against american uh them
61:52 against the american population
61:54 um it would first of all there's too
61:57 many oversight organizations that are
62:00 watching
62:00 um so it'd be next to impossible to get
62:03 away with it for very long
62:05 and the two most americans are patriots
62:07 that work in the government you know
62:08 they're not
62:09 out to try to hurt the american people
62:11 there's i think a lot of people think
62:13 that
62:13 that there's this rogue element in there
62:15 that goes unchecked and it's just you
62:17 know running amok
62:18 within the us government and trying to
62:21 uh you know trample on people's rights
62:24 that's never been the case that i've
62:26 ever seen i've never ever ever seen that
62:30 usually anybody who starts to do that is
62:32 is dealt with very very
62:34 quickly within the us government um that
62:36 type of
62:37 behavior doesn't last for very long um
62:40 if at all
62:41 just because there's there's too many
62:43 people watching
62:44 and and frankly i don't i don't think we
62:46 have bad people in our government
62:48 you know i know there's a lot of people
62:49 that want to continue to villainize
62:51 uh the american government but i i i
62:53 reject that notion i i don't
62:55 think at least my experience over 20 62:57 some years in u.s government i've never
62:59 i've never seen that people want to
63:01 protect americans they don't want to
63:03 hurt them
63:03 um so anyway that's about all i can say
63:06 probably for that
63:07 i appreciate i appreciate that response
63:09 lou um we are
63:10 running out of time now and i have so
63:12 many other questions so i'm gonna have
63:14 to skip down to my very last one because
63:16 it's uh it's quite lengthy
63:18 but i would like to be honest with you
63:19 about my own involvement in this issue
63:21 and so if you don't mind i would like to
63:23 tell you about
63:24 one of the most profound experiences of
63:25 my life which led directly to me
63:27 establishing project unity and then i'd
63:29 very much like to get your thoughts on
63:30 it afterwards
63:32 sure and by the way i appreciate you
63:34 sharing that with me um
63:36 you know understand that on my side
63:38 though there's no judgment
63:39 so uh you know happy to to hear what you
63:42 have to say
63:43 well i appreciate that so um i was
63:45 introduced to the subject and i'm going
63:47 to try and cut a very long story short
63:48 here but i was introduced to the subject
63:50 of ufos through the consciousness
63:52 side of the conversation i'm 26 now and
63:55 it was only a few years ago that i first
63:56 dipped my toes into this area of
63:58 research
63:59 however and to cut a very long story
64:01 short the ufo subject was introduced to
64:03 me a time of depression
64:05 in my life and it was introduced in a
64:07 way that i can
64:08 only really classify as an immense
64:10 synchronicity
64:11 one of the first areas of interest i
64:13 stumbled upon
64:14 was the apparent ability to utilize
64:16 non-local consciousness to essentially
64:18 initiate a rudimentary form of
64:20 communication or contact with some
64:22 aspect of the phenomenon and i also
64:24 became
64:25 very familiar with the remote viewing
64:27 programs the stargate program and all of
64:29 its other following
64:30 uh programs like grill flame and etc and
64:33 this type of information
64:34 happened to coincide with pre-existing
64:36 research and insights into
64:38 consciousness that i'd been undertaking
64:40 before i was introduced to the ufo
64:42 subject and funnily enough
64:43 i was introduced to the ufo subject by
64:45 my very best friend who i consider a bit
64:47 of a
64:47 spiritual partner in all honesty because
64:49 of the amount of synchronicities between
64:51 the two of us so it's quite interesting
64:53 that he was the one that did it but
64:54 needless to say i was quite convinced
64:56 that this type of communication via
64:57 consciousness was possible and so i
64:59 began to go outside into my garden at
65:01 night
65:02 i would calm myself into a meditative
65:04 state and from that calm state of mind
65:06 i'd begin to model very coherent
65:08 thoughts and essentially
65:10 visualize that i was projecting these
65:11 thoughts out into space
65:14 it did not take very long for me to
65:15 begin seeing some strange things
65:17 and this started with white flashes of
65:19 light in the night sky these were static
65:22 flashes that would appear in one area of
65:24 space multiple flashes from one area
65:26 with no discernible structure causing
65:27 the flash
65:28 i would also see large volumes of white
65:30 orbs of light within a very short time
65:32 span although
65:33 these did appear to look like satellites
65:36 i was seeing upwards of
65:37 15 to 20 within the space of only 5 to
65:40 10 minutes which is far more frequent
65:41 than
65:42 any satellites i've ever seen and on top
65:44 of this some of these objects would grow
65:46 in brightness
65:47 exponentially and then at the apex of
65:49 this would flash brightly before then
65:51 subsiding down in brightness to appear
65:53 similar to a satellite again now i am
65:55 aware of
65:55 ir flares or iridium flares but this
65:58 does not occur
65:58 multiple times as the satellite
66:00 traverses the skyline
66:02 whereas these would flash sometimes over
66:04 and over again as they traversed and it
66:05 did seem to be
66:06 in connection to my responses and
66:09 thoughts now
66:10 these were the first signs that
66:11 something was happening but what
66:13 happened on the 25th of august 2019 66:15 changed my life um so i was outside in
66:18 my garden at night and i was attempting
66:20 to initiate a form of contact by
66:22 modeling my thoughts and intentions on
66:24 this goal and there are other things i
66:26 saw before this but i want to try and
66:28 keep this as quick as i can for you to
66:29 respond
66:30 what i saw coming across the left-hand
66:32 side of my sky
66:33 was a dark cloud that i can only
66:35 describe as staticy or highly charged
66:38 i'd never seen anything like it it was
66:40 as if every single particle of the cloud
66:42 was agitated or highly energized and
66:44 this cloud was drifting
66:46 quite normally as a cloud does but its
66:48 appearance was nothing i'd ever seen
66:50 before
66:50 it was traversing my sky from left to
66:52 right just normally going across and as
66:54 it came above my house
66:56 and it was in direct alignment with me
66:58 it did a complete
66:59 90 degree change of course and began
67:01 heading across the sky
67:02 in alignment with me essentially moving
67:04 down the garden path towards me but
67:06 still high up in the sky
67:08 as it got above my head this cloud
67:10 literally vanished it faded out in a
67:12 matter of seconds it just kind of
67:13 fizzled away and inside this cloud was a
67:16 triangular formation of roughly 25 to 30 67:18 orange orbs of light
67:20 it didn't stop above my head when the
67:22 cloud vanished and i saw what was within
67:24 it
67:25 it was still moving but now it was a
67:27 crystal clear formation of orbs
67:28 some of which i could see were weaving
67:31 in between each other as this formation
67:33 traversed the skyline it vanished
67:35 over the horizon and my life was changed
67:37 forever now the first person i called
67:38 was my mum
67:39 i was basically in tears now lou before
67:42 you respond you need to be aware that on
67:44 three other occasions
67:45 since that event i have seen orange orbs
67:47 come over my sky and on one of these
67:49 occasions
67:50 three orbs literally came down and
67:52 hovered above my house
67:55 and i don't know what they are i have no
67:57 understanding of this other than the
67:58 fact that i am completely
68:00 unequivocally convinced that they
68:02 responded to my desires
68:03 intentions and coherent thoughts
68:05 regarding contact i can't see
68:07 how it's possible through any other
68:09 means as it would need to be such a
68:10 staggering coincidence for these things
68:13 to turn up exactly when i was attempting
68:14 to initiate contact now i tell you this
68:16 simply because
68:17 this is why i'm here doing what i'm
68:19 doing i want to know what they are and i
68:22 also
68:22 you know i want people to understand
68:24 that consciousness is integral to this
68:25 subject and i firmly believe
68:27 in the non-local capacity of
68:28 consciousness its ability to exchange
68:30 quantum information regardless of
68:32 distance
68:32 and jim semivan once said that you told
68:35 him that you believe we will find the
68:37 answers to this subject between the
68:38 nexus of consciousness and quantum
68:40 mechanics i believe this as well and i'm
68:42 going to be quiet now and allow you to
68:44 respond to this because in all honesty
68:46 any insights that you can provide
68:48 would be really appreciated for my
68:49 personal journey
68:52 wow well uh again thank you for
68:56 for sharing that with me you're welcome
68:58 i appreciate it and i know it's a very
69:00 intimate uh and sincere story that you
69:04 have
69:04 and i want to thank you for sharing that
69:06 with me and your audience thank you
69:08 two i'm not surprised that you you've
69:11 had those experiences
69:12 i spoke to many many people that have
69:15 had
69:16 very interesting experiences as it
69:19 relates to the uap
69:20 phenomenon uh a lot of the pilots have
69:23 been
69:24 affected uh irrevocably um profoundly
69:28 to the point where uh they've committed
69:30 now their lives
69:31 uh to trying to pursue this topic a lot
69:34 of military people who've been
69:37 if you will witness to to uap
69:40 activity uh as far as your experiences
69:45 um you know all i can say is i i wasn't
69:47 there
69:48 so i can't tell you
69:52 one way or another what you should
69:55 necessarily think about it
69:56 what i can tell you is that there's a
69:58 lot of people who've had
70:00 very compelling experiences and many of
70:03 them
70:04 swear by it and are absolutely certain
70:06 that they
70:07 have the ability to interact with or
70:10 control or influence these things
70:15 and unfortunately there's nothing i can
70:18 do
70:18 to one way or the other to um
70:22 to prove or disprove it's it's my
70:24 frustration as well
70:26 yes now my approach to that since
70:30 uh there's not much i can do is to
70:32 continue focusing on the science
70:33 aspect yeah which is the nuts and bolts
70:36 it does not mean that any
70:38 other aspects are less important i think
70:41 people oftentimes
70:43 confuse that when they say you know just
70:46 the facts ma'am or
70:47 just the science we've got before we can
70:49 run
70:51 absolutely look guys we don't even
70:53 understand
70:54 what's in the bottom of our own ocean
70:57 you know let alone
70:58 uh how the human mind works and its
71:01 ability to do things
71:02 um you know my my biggest issue with
71:06 with this topic has never been
71:09 people who've experienced things it's
71:11 been people who have provided false
71:13 narratives
71:14 uh based upon incomplete information
71:17 people that have profited from uh
71:20 other individuals to quote unquote share
71:23 the truth to tell a story
71:26 that's my problem that's my problem
71:29 that's it's never been about
71:31 experiencers or or anything like that
71:34 um i just think that we always have to
71:37 remain diligent
71:38 of of the facts and you know i
71:42 that's why i never talk about my my my
71:44 own personal
71:46 beliefs it's not that i don't think
71:50 they happened or they did happen or they
71:52 didn't happen
71:53 i'm just not sure how valid it is in the
71:56 grand scheme of things
71:58 because there's not a whole lot i can do
71:59 with it it's too subjective i can't
72:01 i can't brief somebody uh on
72:04 on on data that can't
72:08 be necessarily repeated all the time or
72:11 in the scientific
72:12 or be be proven in the science using the
72:14 scientific method
72:15 um you know if we get to a point where
72:18 we can do that then that's fantastic you
72:19 know then we've got even
72:21 more interesting conversation to have
72:23 but until that occurs
72:24 i've gotta i've gotta focus on on the
72:27 nuts and bolts
72:27 um as much as a turn off that may be for
72:30 some people
72:31 um that's kind of what i have to do yeah
72:34 and i i know for a lot of people very
72:36 frustrating and they probably look at us
72:38 kind of being
72:38 sincere and you know but that's what i
72:42 have to work with
72:43 um because there's no way it's like
72:46 religion
72:47 you know the reason why people
72:50 feel the way they do by religion you can
72:52 have uh
72:53 people with different backgrounds um
72:57 believing in in a similar god but then
72:59 they describe it completely different
73:01 and uh it's it's tough
73:05 it's it's very very tough it puts me
73:07 puts me in a situation where now i have
73:09 to
73:10 i have to defend the veracity of
73:13 information that
73:14 frankly is anecdotal and again it's not
73:16 that it's not true it could very well be
73:18 true and accurate but i have no way to
73:20 prove it
73:21 and so if i have no way to prove it
73:24 i'm kind of wasting my time it's
73:26 interesting to hear and listen to but
73:28 i can't offer anything i can't offer any
73:30 type of solution
73:32 i i agree it's you know it's a tough
73:34 pill to swallow but it's
73:36 extremely subjective experiences and
73:38 this is something that i've had to come
73:39 to terms with as well and i have
73:41 actually you know
73:42 focused a bit more on on the nuts and
73:43 bolts aspects of these of these
73:45 subjects because like you said what can
73:48 i do
73:48 i have to just be patient and hope for
73:51 an answer to arrive at some point maybe
73:52 someone smarter than me will be able to
73:54 figure this out
73:56 and i suspect it will i mean i i i
73:58 suspect it will over time we'll we'll
74:00 begin to learn more but
74:02 you know before you can you can figure
74:04 out the intentions of of the great squid
74:06 of the pacific and his feeding patterns
74:07 you
74:08 first have to find one right right you
74:10 have to get your butt underwater
74:12 and see it and then start studying it
74:14 and then then and only then maybe can
74:16 you start
74:17 figuring out some of the bigger
74:18 questions you know surrounding its you
74:20 know
74:20 migratory patterns and feeding behavior
74:22 et cetera et cetera
74:24 yeah so i just want to thank you most
74:26 sincerely for taking the time to be here
74:28 with me i hope it hasn't been too much
74:30 of an interrogation
74:32 no no listen my pleasure i i think i
74:35 think we need to have the conversation
74:36 and i think you're doing a great job and
74:38 i i really appreciate your audience i'm
74:40 sorry i'm not quite as lively as i
74:41 normally am
74:42 uh i'm unfortunately i'm uh i'm kind of
74:46 tired i don't doubt it
74:49 yeah you've been on a path of interviews
74:51 recently you need some rest my friend
74:53 yeah i do uh i i agree i definitely
74:56 could use some rest
74:58 um but thank you for what you're doing
75:00 and
75:01 thank you for sharing with me your your
75:03 your personal experience
75:05 um i'm humbled that you would do that
75:07 thank you so much and i know it's
75:08 probably difficult doing that
75:10 on air uh right because now the whole
75:12 world's gonna know your experience
75:14 so well i have spoken about it before on
75:16 my platform to be fair
75:18 um so some people will have heard it
75:20 maybe not some others that are
75:21 more recent to my platform but no i
75:24 wanted to share it with you because
75:25 it's sincere and it is the reason why
75:27 i'm doing what i'm doing but um
75:29 honestly thank you again you are without
75:31 a doubt to me at least
75:32 an american hero and it really has been
75:34 a pleasure and hopefully one to be
75:35 repeated in the future
75:38 well well thank you but you know i can't
75:39 let you say that without me
75:41 giving credit where credit is due and i
75:44 i'm really
75:46 uh you know people say that uh
75:49 i'm a hero i'm i'm really not i'm just
75:52 doing my job
75:54 so there's a lot of people i've served
75:55 with many heroes before in the past
75:57 um you know that that deserve that
76:00 title um and i i really i
76:03 i'm not one of those but i thank you
76:05 very much well i i no
76:06 okay i understand where you're coming
76:08 from there but a lot of people really do

00:00 [Music]
00:05 there's a whole fleet of them look on
00:06 the assay
00:08 oh my gosh they're all going against the
00:11 wind
00:14 it was basically a cube with inside of
00:16 sphere where the points of the cube
00:19 were touching outside the sphere
00:33 [Music]
00:34 [Applause]
00:37 so this isn't anything that just is
00:38 limited to the united states
00:40 it's a worldwide phenomenon
00:50 hi everyone and welcome to a very
00:51 special that ufo podcast
00:54 i'm not going to waste too much time and
00:56 get straight into the interview for this
00:57 one
00:58 because you are here for one reason and
00:59 one reason only
01:01 uh for a long time i've made no secret
01:02 the top of my wish list for guests on
01:04 this podcast
01:05 would be one mr louise elizondo and i'm
01:08 delighted to see i have lou
01:09 on the podcast with me now welcome to
01:11 the podcast
01:13 thank you very much it's uh certainly my
01:15 honor and privilege um
01:17 i sincerely appreciate your time and of
01:19 course your audience's time as well
01:22 listen uh it's no secret people seek out
01:24 your interviews and they troll through
01:26 them with a fine tooth comb
01:28 to get any little nuggets of information
01:29 they can so hopefully we can get through
01:31 as much
01:32 on this interview as possible the
01:33 response from the listeners has been
01:35 incredible
01:36 um i would just like to preface it by
01:37 saying that i've watched your interviews
01:39 recently with john greenwald on black
01:41 vault
01:42 and ryan sprague somewhere in the skies
01:44 i have tried to stay away from anything
01:46 they talked about because they've done a
01:48 good job with their interviews
01:49 and i would highly suggest and recommend
01:51 people go and seek out those interviews
01:53 for anything that i potentially don't
01:55 cover and i'd like to get straight into
01:56 the first question lou um regarding your
01:59 security clearance this is something a
02:01 lot of people bring up as a source of
02:02 frustration
02:03 when you can't answer the question in
02:05 the way that they might not like you to
02:08 can you start off just by talking a
02:09 little bit about your clearance that you
02:11 have
02:11 why you still have it and what exactly
02:13 that means
02:14 yeah sure so security clearance is i
02:18 think a lot of times over
02:19 complicated uh if if people on the
02:21 outside haven't spent any time in the
02:23 government
02:24 there's this giant mystery behind you
02:25 know a security clearance what it means
02:27 and
02:28 and the type of access of information
02:30 you have here in the united states we
02:32 have
02:32 three classifications of of
02:35 if you will information um besides
02:38 unclassified
02:39 unclassified isn't really a
02:40 classification it's just unclassified
02:42 information
02:44 um the three classifications are
02:46 confidential which is the first tier of
02:48 information
02:49 secret which is a second tier and
02:51 ultimately
02:52 top secret information now there's
02:54 actually legal guidelines
02:56 of what this this information means from
02:58 a from a top secret perspective that
03:00 means if information were to get
03:02 compromised
03:03 uh and put out uh into the public sphere
03:06 if an enemy were to gain access to that
03:09 information it would cause quote unquote
03:11 grave or exceptional damage to the
03:14 united states national security
03:16 so that's in essence why we classify
03:20 information
03:20 particularly to protect sources and
03:22 methods
03:23 that's very important because a lot of
03:25 times information in itself
03:27 might be unclassified but how you
03:29 collect that information
03:31 um can be very very sensitive and so
03:33 that's why we classify information the
03:35 way we do
03:36 in my case because i was in the
03:38 intelligence community for so long
03:40 in order to have the job that i have the
03:42 government insisted
03:43 all of us with that particular if you
03:45 will expertise
03:46 in counterintelligence intelligence
03:48 human intelligence
03:50 you have to have a top secret security
03:52 clearance
03:53 meaning that you have to go through an
03:55 extensive background investigation
03:56 psychological
03:57 uh evaluations and polygraphs to get
04:01 access to certain information within
04:03 within that caveat of top secret and
04:05 then within
04:05 the top secret layer think of a a layer
04:09 cake maybe a wedding cake that's got
04:10 many different layers of frosting
04:12 uh throughout the cake at the top secret
04:14 level
04:15 people think well it's top secret
04:17 information
04:19 that's it well there's actually some sub
04:21 layers
04:22 or strata if you will even within the
04:24 top secret
04:25 and you have sci which is sensitive
04:27 compartmented information
04:29 you have sap information and you've got
04:31 these little little cutouts
04:33 that are within the top secret realm but
04:35 they are extremely
04:37 nuanced very very sensitive um again
04:40 because of the line of work that i was
04:41 in
04:42 i was required to have that type of
04:43 security clearance
04:45 when it comes to the uap topic when i
04:48 am talking uh about information a lot of
04:52 it
04:52 is unclassified the problem is how that
04:55 unclassified information was obtained it
04:58 was obtained through some very sensitive
05:00 sources and methods
05:01 obviously we don't want as a nation to
05:03 compromise those sources and methods
05:05 otherwise you can't use them ever again
05:07 because you get compromised
05:09 especially in the world of human
05:11 intelligence you're talking about
05:12 people's lives when you're collecting
05:15 information from another human being
05:16 that
05:17 probably shouldn't be telling you that
05:18 information there's a level of trust
05:21 there
05:21 that has to be exercised and really to
05:24 some degree that person's life is now in
05:26 your hands because if the country that
05:28 they're from
05:29 finds out that they're sharing
05:30 information with you it could be well
05:32 that's that's considered spying
05:34 technically uh by by a lot of other
05:36 countries uh rules and
05:38 and laws um so you know in that shadowy
05:41 world of intelligence and espionage
05:43 you have to have that level of of
05:45 security clearance and there is a
05:47 a requirement there's a a if you will an
05:50 nda
05:51 right non-disclosure agreement that you
05:53 sign and it's not like a company's
05:55 non-disclosure agreement it's far more
05:57 comprehensive
05:58 it basically subjugates me to jail time
06:01 uh
06:01 there are several acts like the s u.s
06:04 espionage act for example
06:06 that if i violate my tr the trust and
06:08 confidence
06:09 that the us government has bestowed into
06:11 me and let's not forget that that trust
06:14 and confidence
06:15 is really a derivative of the people's
06:17 trust and confidence right i represent
06:20 the the people the united states uh they
06:22 have trusted me with that level of
06:25 security clearance knowing that i would
06:26 not share certain information and if i
06:28 violate that
06:29 i can go to jail i can be prosecuted i
06:32 can i
06:33 can have a lot of things happening to me
06:34 now i think it's also important to say
06:37 that when i tell people i can't discuss
06:39 that
06:39 uh because of my security clearance i'm
06:42 not saying that because i'm necessarily
06:43 afraid to go to jail
06:44 um i mean obviously i don't want to go
06:46 to jail but but it's because it's it's
06:48 for me it's a sacred it's a sacred
06:51 oath that i took and that oath wasn't
06:53 just to the us government it was to the
06:55 american people
06:56 it's a bit like a marriage when you when
06:59 you make that oath till death do us part
07:02 it's an oath till death do us part and
07:03 it's not just to the partner you're
07:05 making that commitment to
07:06 it's actually an oath you're making to
07:07 yourself so if i were to make an
07:10 exception to that and violate that that
07:12 that oath that i have sworn many many
07:14 years ago everything
07:16 else i've ever done is is up for grabs
07:18 too
07:19 i mean if something that simple my oath
07:21 to the american people can be violated
07:23 that's simply by saying well i'm going
07:24 to let you know something
07:26 then everything that i've ever stood for
07:28 before whether it's
07:29 you know going to war or or conducting
07:32 the operations i have
07:33 on behalf of the american people that is
07:35 also up in question too
07:37 and i open up to i'm sorry that is also
07:40 open up
07:41 for questioning two and so um
07:44 you know i i take my oath seriously uh
07:47 ultimately it's an oath i've made to the
07:49 american people it's the same oath that
07:50 that i've made to my daughters and my
07:53 family that that
07:54 when i say i i take this responsibility
07:56 seriously
07:58 i mean i take a responsib i take that
07:59 responsibility seriously
08:01 you know i'm gonna digress you just for
08:03 a moment because three years ago when i
08:05 first came out
08:06 there's a lot of stuff i could have said
08:08 up front
08:09 that probably would have saved me a lot
08:10 of grief a lot of sharp shooting by a
08:12 lot of people
08:14 but i'm not going to sell out
08:16 individuals and sources that i've worked
08:18 with in the government
08:19 just to save my ass i'm not that kind of
08:21 guy i never have been i never will be so
08:23 you know i know as as more information
08:25 comes to life people are kind of
08:26 frustrated saying you know lou why
08:28 why didn't you just say this three years
08:30 ago or two years ago you know
08:32 and all this guesswork that we had to do
08:34 well because i'm not that kind of guy
08:37 i'm not just going to go ahead and say
08:38 something and compromise somebody else
08:41 in the program
08:42 just to save my credibility that's not
08:44 what this endeavor is about it's not
08:46 about satisfying
08:47 satisfying the idle curiosity of people
08:49 and it's not about vindicating myself it
08:51 never has been this is a much more
08:52 profound journey
08:54 about about telling the american people
08:56 the truth
08:57 and if that truth the cost of telling
08:59 the truth is at my own expense
09:01 as i've said before then that's that's
09:04 that's a
09:05 that's an easy solution for me i'll i'll
09:07 do whatever i have to do to have that
09:09 conversation
09:10 so i'd like to follow on from that with
09:12 that in mind when you appeared on fox
09:14 news with tucker carlson
09:16 he asked if you believe the us
09:17 government has debris from crashed uap
09:19 and its possession
09:20 your response was and i'll quote
09:22 hopefully correctly here
09:23 simply put yes that's a big answer
09:27 how can you give that as an answer with
09:29 that clearance in mind
09:31 well because i'm not saying the
09:34 specifics i'm not saying where it is
09:35 where it's from
09:37 uh who collected it uh remember what
09:40 he said he said do you believe that the
09:42 u.s government
09:44 has material in its possession well he's
09:47 asking me my
09:48 my personal opinion uh and and i can i
09:52 can provide my personal opinion in that
09:54 regard i'm allowed to based upon the
09:55 information i saw
09:57 i i can say that because he's not asking
09:59 me to say
10:00 something to the effect of um for
10:03 example
10:04 who collected the material where is it
10:05 being stored under whose authorities and
10:08 auspices what are its capabilities what
10:09 is it
10:10 specifically made out of that's not what
10:12 the question was he just simply asked me
10:14 do you believe
10:15 there is recovered material anything
10:17 beyond that
10:18 other than what i believe now becomes
10:21 stated fact
10:22 and now i have to be careful because
10:24 that stated fact is based upon knowledge
10:26 that i had as as as a employee of the us
10:29 government and that's why i was very
10:31 specific when i said
10:33 you know i have to be careful what i say
10:35 here i i
10:36 i take a minute and i have to pause and
10:38 have to think about it because
10:40 you know it's a it's a very fine line
10:42 there's there's a there's a ledge there
10:44 and i'm tiptoeing pretty close to that
10:46 ledge and i you know
10:48 one word just one wrong word and
10:51 i'm i'm gonna be over the edge and uh
10:54 you know
10:55 it things can get very complicated for
10:57 me
10:58 i would presume a background in
11:00 counterintelligence helps you tip to
11:01 that edge pretty well
11:03 um and it seems to have worked for you
11:04 so far um it's been well documented
11:06 since you're parting of ways with ttsa
11:08 that it's been amicable and you've got a
11:10 lot of friends there and you enjoyed
11:11 your time there
11:12 since then have you been able to hold on
11:14 to any projects you were involved with
11:17 at the time with ttsa that you can
11:19 continue to work on
11:21 what a good question very very
11:23 insightful thank you for asking that
11:25 question
11:26 the answer is a wholehearted yes uh
11:29 there are efforts within ttsa that i'm
11:32 still
11:33 very much engaged with that ttsa now
11:36 that it's refocusing
11:37 uh to the entertainment piece um i have
11:41 the ability to
11:42 run with some of these other efforts uh
11:45 in a way
11:45 that doesn't interfere uh
11:49 or or complicate what ttsa is trying to
11:52 achieve
11:52 and at the same time allows me the
11:54 flexibility to as i've said before
11:56 shift into second gear basically uh
12:00 move this effort now into phase two
12:03 any specifics around those that you can
12:05 talk about
12:08 um not at this moment i think
12:11 very very soon it'll be clear um the
12:14 reason why i don't want to talk about it
12:15 is because
12:16 they're in a delicate state of um of
12:19 development
12:20 and what i don't want to do is say
12:21 something right now prematurely
12:24 and you know let's say there's an
12:26 organization out there that's very
12:27 interested in partnering with us to
12:28 bring this capability to full maturity
12:30 right
12:31 i don't want to do anything to spook the
12:33 herd um this is still
12:35 i mean it's still a very it's still very
12:38 controversial topic that we're dealing
12:39 with we're talking about uaps
12:41 and frankly we're just now getting to
12:43 the point where i think it's becoming
12:45 more accepted
12:46 but but we haven't achieved that that
12:50 state of normalcy yet that we're all
12:51 looking for so
12:53 i have to be careful stigma and taboo is
12:54 still a very
12:56 significant part of this conversation
12:58 and i have to tread very lightly and
13:00 delicately sometimes
13:02 when you talk about stigma and taboo
13:03 normally with most people talking about
13:05 that with me
13:06 in this subject i would say that you
13:07 know that you can't tell me anything
13:09 better but given who i'm talking with
13:10 you probably can and given what your
13:12 line of work's been in the past as well
13:14 as part of those changes at ttsa steve
13:17 justice and chris melon also left
13:19 what is your relationship with those
13:21 gentlemen today and do you still plan to
13:22 collaborate on projects with them
13:25 oh yeah daily uh we should be no
13:28 surprise that
13:30 we are in very uh close collaboration
13:33 proximity from a perspective of
13:35 collaboration uh
13:36 there's very little daylight in fact uh
13:38 i speak to to
13:39 chris um on uh on a on a daily basis
13:44 uh we are working very hard together
13:46 this has been a really
13:48 and forgive me for saying this because
13:50 people i think are going to look into
13:51 this and they're going to
13:52 misconstrue what i'm saying um they're
13:54 going to say i see you i told you he was
13:56 manipulating
13:57 um chris and i chris is
14:01 is absolutely the epitome of a
14:02 strategist he's probably one of the most
14:05 intelligent human beings i have
14:06 ever met and i've met a lot of smart
14:09 people
14:10 um we have been running this for the
14:12 last three years very much like you
14:14 would a military or an intelligence
14:15 campaign
14:16 there's five pillars of emphasis that we
14:19 have been focusing on
14:20 and none of these pillars can ever
14:23 become taller than the other think of
14:24 putting a roof
14:25 on on a house right you can't have one
14:28 side of the house
14:29 taller than the other sides because the
14:31 roof gets cockeyed so the five pillars
14:33 are
14:34 the first one has been legislative
14:35 engagement and that's in making sure
14:38 that our our senior elected officials in
14:40 this country the committees
14:41 are properly briefed into the phenomenon
14:45 the next pillar has been senior
14:47 executive uh engagement
14:49 on the executive branch senior
14:51 leadership so um that would be engaging
14:53 those individuals in the executive
14:55 branch
14:56 that need to be briefed so for example
14:58 um everybody knows that in the last
15:00 administration the president had been
15:02 briefed a few times
15:03 the secretary of defense secretary of
15:05 defense was briefed
15:06 um you know the former director of the
15:08 cia so it's now coming to light that
15:10 these people were briefed so that was
15:12 the second pillar executive
15:14 engagement executive level of engagement
15:16 the third pillar
15:17 has been international engagement
15:18 engaging those friends and allies
15:21 in other countries are counterparts that
15:24 are
15:24 interested in having this conversation
15:26 they're seeing something too they never
15:27 really wanted to say anything but now
15:28 that the u.s has stepped forward
15:30 they can reach forward and say hey you
15:32 know we'd like to talk to you about this
15:34 topic because
15:35 we've we've got some questions like you
15:37 saw with japan
15:38 recently and they've come out and
15:39 established a relationship with the
15:41 united states for the explicit purposes
15:43 of sharing
15:43 uap information i mean that's a big deal
15:46 right
15:46 and then the fourth pillar is media
15:48 engagement making sure that mainstream
15:50 media has enough information
15:52 um so they know they can have a a a an
15:56 elevated conversation about the topic
15:58 we're no longer talking about
15:59 tin foil hats and elvis on the
16:00 mothership we're talking about science
16:02 we're talking about quantum physics
16:04 we're talking about about a real
16:08 issue that we have right now something
16:10 that is in our skies we don't know what
16:11 it is we don't know where it's from we
16:12 don't really know how it works and
16:14 there's not much we can do about it
16:15 um that's that's that's that's a tough
16:17 discussion to have
16:19 and media is finally taking it seriously
16:21 um despite this
16:22 you know 70 some odd years of of
16:24 ridicule and
16:26 and bad hollywood movies about the topic
16:28 and then the fifth pillar is
16:29 is is engaging the masses engaging
16:33 people and that is critically important
16:36 and so let me dissect a little bit about
16:38 the five pillars you don't ever want
16:40 your legislative branch to get ahead of
16:42 the ball
16:43 uh beyond your executive branch because
16:45 it takes both of them you have people
16:46 making laws and then people executing
16:48 laws so
16:49 so you never want to make sure that
16:50 either the conservatives or liberals or
16:52 anybody else
16:53 has more information the other side this
16:54 is a nonpartisan issue
16:56 it's everybody gets the same amount of
16:58 information if you have the security
17:00 clearance
17:00 and you're in a position of authority
17:02 then at the same time
17:04 when we talk about the media engagement
17:07 and public engagement
17:08 that's critically important because both
17:10 the executive branch and legislative
17:11 branch
17:12 are responsive to the people period full
17:15 stop
17:16 meaning ultimately we serve
17:19 the people not the other way around the
17:21 the people do not serve the government
17:23 the government serves
17:24 the people that is in our constitution
17:26 and anybody who's forgotten that
17:27 shouldn't be in government
17:29 so it is important that the people have
17:31 as much information as they can
17:33 to then enable their leadership as we've
17:36 been seeing right now this tremendous
17:38 effort within ufo twitter to engage
17:40 members of congress to engage the media
17:42 it's working it's working it's it's
17:45 people say well you're not sharing
17:46 classified information no but i don't
17:48 have to
17:49 we're we are achieving more with this
17:52 grassroots effort
17:54 um than ever by me just going and
17:56 briefing congress at the classified
17:57 level
17:58 all of this has to happen simultaneously
18:00 it has to be deliberate
18:02 it has to be strategic uh and it has to
18:05 be
18:06 purposeful and and i think um
18:10 you know it's if people were to realize
18:12 just spend a day in our shoes they'd
18:13 realize
18:15 it's not that easy i mean it's it's
18:17 tough and
18:18 you know a lot of the playbook where
18:20 we're writing as as
18:21 as we're doing it's kind of like
18:23 building an airplane while you're flying
18:25 it
18:25 um it's it's kind of tough and i don't
18:28 want to take credit for it because i
18:30 really can't there's a
18:31 there's a lot of smart people that are
18:33 working this effort behind the scenes
18:34 both inside the government
18:36 and outside the government
18:43 oh we'll give it a second sorry man you
18:46 know that so that's okay that's dan's
18:48 going to note that one down for us just
18:49 roughly
18:50 okay sorry i had someone trying to call
18:51 me through so i apologize that's okay uh
18:54 it's it's you know we make mistakes all
18:56 the time um but this is why
18:58 once again ufo twitter so important
19:01 because
19:02 you guys have a lot of great ideas a lot
19:04 of things that we don't think about
19:06 and on a daily basis as i'm reading
19:08 through the twitter sphere i'm not
19:09 reading comments while people think
19:10 about me
19:11 quite frankly i don't give a [ __ ] what
19:12 people think about me what i care is how
19:14 people are taking the topic
19:16 and if they have any new ideas and
19:18 insights and it's valuable
19:20 it's paying off we're able to then take
19:22 some of those ideas formulate them into
19:24 a strategy
19:24 and then execute those strategies in a
19:26 very meaningful meaningful purposeful
19:28 way
19:28 whether we're dealing with congress or
19:30 the u.s government or foreign
19:32 governments or the media
19:33 and that's great to hear and i would
19:35 encourage people in the uk particularly
19:37 which the the conversations
19:39 poor to non-existent to check out a uap
19:41 media uk which is something we are
19:43 trying to help with from a media
19:44 perspective in the uk as well
19:46 now shifting attack slightly low i want
19:49 to ask you about your trip to pick up
19:51 materials from the bledsoes
19:53 now the bledsoes are a family with an
19:55 immense interest particularly in the ufo
19:57 uap community
19:58 are you still in contact with krishna's
20:00 family and what's the status of the
20:02 project there
20:03 you know chris is a wonderful gentleman
20:05 i've had the the pleasure of meeting him
20:06 twice
20:07 uh in person um that meeting was really
20:11 facilitated through
20:12 one of my former colleagues at the time
20:14 tom delonge and jim semivam
20:17 um i you know i i cannot
20:20 substantiate publicly uh the claims i
20:23 have i believe uh in my heart of hearts
20:25 that they truly believe
20:27 what they're experiencing and at the
20:28 same time it actually may be correct
20:30 i don't know the problem is it's it's
20:32 very subjective uh
20:34 which a lot of stuff is in this field is
20:36 subjective so
20:38 so i'm not saying that it's it's true or
20:40 it's not true what i'm simply saying is
20:42 that
20:42 at the end of the day we have to use
20:45 methodologies that can
20:46 that that conform to the scientific
20:49 principles
20:50 of of science and that means you know
20:52 peer review and this has to be
20:54 repeatable
20:55 and and things like that otherwise it's
20:57 just anecdotal
20:58 again i'm not i'm not diminishing the
21:01 value
21:02 or the reality of what they are
21:04 experiencing
21:05 i'm pretty certain there's a lot a lot
21:08 of strange things happening there
21:10 very similar to skinwalker ranch but the
21:12 problem is i have to remain
21:14 focused i have to remain focused on on
21:16 the uap
21:17 issue that we're dealing with right now
21:20 and people just say well it is related
21:22 well okay fine but again i've got no
21:24 data to prove that
21:25 you know i don't know what's going on
21:28 over there regarding the blood cells
21:29 other than what's been reported
21:31 and so for me um you know i'm not saying
21:36 it's it's not valid or relevant
21:39 i just don't have enough data yet to to
21:41 make any type of conclusive
21:43 uh decision if it fits into the calculus
21:46 of the effort we're on
21:47 because i can't go to kang a member of
21:49 congress or a senior member of the
21:51 executive department and say
21:52 oh by the way these people are having
21:54 these these paranormal experiences over
21:55 there we should listen to them
21:58 that that's not going to get me very far
22:00 i have to
22:01 you know what what's what's so i think
22:03 compelling about the uap
22:04 issue is that you have human beings
22:06 which are trained observers right think
22:07 of a human being as no
22:08 no different than any other intelligence
22:10 collection system
22:12 so you have human beings that are that
22:14 are that are identifying something
22:16 occurring
22:17 which is backed up then and collected on
22:19 electro optical data like gun camera
22:21 footage
22:21 which is also backed up by by
22:23 electromagnetic information like radar
22:26 right and all of a sudden you know you
22:27 have three different separate collection
22:30 capabilities all looking at the same
22:33 thing
22:33 at the same time in the same place under
22:35 the same circumstances
22:37 that's data that i can i can then
22:39 present in a meaningful way
22:42 to decision makers that that is is a
22:45 much
22:45 um easier approach
22:48 at least for me and my colleagues to
22:52 to achieve mission success and again i
22:54 don't want to disparage in any way
22:56 uh the blood cells or anybody else who
22:58 has their own personal experiences
23:00 because that's why they're called
23:01 personal experiences
23:02 they're personal um but
23:05 but right now i can't include that in my
23:07 calculus it's a lovely family very
23:09 wonderful family
23:10 and i have no reason to believe that
23:12 that mr bledsoe or his family
23:15 are lying or deceiving in any way um
23:18 but again that data just i can't
23:20 incorporate it into the current calculus
23:23 that i'm using if that makes sense
23:25 absolutely and you mentioned skin walker
23:27 ranch now i've
23:28 spoken with brandon fugal and he'll be
23:30 on the podcast soon hopefully
23:32 um himself bob bigelow both former and
23:35 president owner of skinwalker ranch
23:37 have had their own scientific
23:38 experiments going on and
23:40 some data released you know a good tv
23:42 show has come out as part of that as
23:43 well which the second season is juicing
23:46 but they are still ongoing scientific
23:47 experience experiences and experiments
23:49 sorry
23:51 they have both said and others around
23:53 skinwalker ranch that it comes with
23:55 somewhat of a sticky portfolio
23:57 and this topic and subject if you want
23:59 to put the phenomena under an umbrella
24:01 have you ever had any experiences like
24:03 that yourself
24:06 uh wow
24:09 again great question uh and one
24:11 unfortunately
24:12 i'm gonna politely sidestep at this time
24:16 um
24:18 uh you know that was a that was um that
24:21 was many years ago
24:22 and uh a lot of uh effort and
24:25 talent was put into that um i am aware
24:29 of of what they were doing
24:32 but i think that's i think probably i
24:35 think i'll sidestep this question
24:37 because um i
24:40 really am not the right guy to answer
24:42 that question you just
24:44 asked me have i had any personal
24:46 experiences
24:48 if i did or i did not i'm not sure if
24:50 that impacts
24:51 um the ongoing effort right now that
24:54 we're engaged with
24:55 and i don't you know i don't want to
24:57 prejudice the jury it's important as
25:00 an investigator i try to remain as as
25:02 fair and impartial and objective as
25:04 possible
25:05 and introducing uh my own personal
25:09 feelings or beliefs or observations
25:12 about
25:13 that um you know i i i'm not sure is is
25:17 overly helpful
25:17 um i'd probably rely on individuals that
25:20 were more involved with that effort
25:22 to to answer that question that's what
25:25 i'll say for part three or part four
25:26 with
25:27 zondo and years to come potentially and
25:29 ask that again there you go
25:31 can you talk on the work you are doing
25:33 with uh are you going to be doing with
25:35 the lakota tribe uh there seems to be a
25:36 strong connection between native
25:38 american tribes
25:39 and the phenomena itself
25:42 well damn once again you're asking great
25:44 questions and i'll answer that one
25:46 um yes i we are absolutely
25:50 engaged in that effort let's not forget
25:53 that the
25:53 the first nations of saskatchewan and
25:55 all frankly most indigenous peoples
25:58 um have oral traditions that go back in
26:01 some cases
26:02 thousands and thousands of years
26:03 pre-history from our perspective
26:07 and to very much the same that an f-18 26:10 pilot is a trained observer
26:12 uh when flying a combat mission um
26:16 indigenous people are trained observers
26:19 when it comes to
26:20 their land and um although it might come
26:24 from a
26:24 slightly different paradigm than we're
26:26 used to in the western world
26:28 uh indigenous people have a profound
26:30 sense of history
26:32 and uh that that it is it is that
26:35 history
26:37 that we are very curious to see if we
26:40 can see some of the same patterns
26:42 that we see in um in the current effort
26:46 regarding ayton
26:47 but even more importantly than that i
26:49 think i think all indigenous people have
26:52 have lessons that we can learn from i
26:54 think we
26:55 in it we live in a very materialistic
26:57 world
26:58 uh that is heavily dependent upon
27:01 technology
27:02 and um you know indigenous people
27:05 for for millennia have gotten along just
27:07 fine without it
27:09 and uh their their sense of government
27:12 and their sense of organization their
27:13 sense of fairness
27:15 uh is is truly profound and i think
27:18 if we can show the world
27:21 just a little bit of that beauty uh
27:25 we we might be better off we might be
27:28 better off as a civilization we might be
27:30 better off as a race as a species
27:32 um i'm not going to go into detail but
27:35 when i
27:35 when i had the the the distinct uh honor
27:38 of going up and meeting
27:39 the the chief and the elders of
27:43 of the bands um with the lakota dakota
27:46 bands that they'd prefer to be
27:47 called bands it was a
27:51 it was a profound experience for me it
27:53 was it was um
27:55 it was an epiphany i learned
27:59 so much in that brief time i had with
28:02 them and again i
28:03 i don't want to share the specific
28:05 instances because
28:06 i would like to eventually provide that
28:08 in a much more professional manner
28:11 uh for everybody to see but um it was
28:15 it was not nothing less than
28:19 soul shaking and i mean that sincerely
28:23 uh i i realize there's a whole another
28:26 aspect
28:27 to humanity that we have seen
28:30 to forget and indigenous people have
28:33 despite the challenges they have faced
28:36 over the years whether it's disease
28:38 or or being moved against their will to
28:42 reservations
28:43 and the hardships and the discrimination
28:45 that they have faced
28:46 over and over again somehow they were
28:49 able to maintain
28:51 their dignity and and their humanity
28:55 and um for me it was a
29:00 it was an understanding of resilience
29:03 and that the that there is an indelible
29:05 part of the human being
29:07 whether you call it the soul or the id
29:08 or the chi or whatever
29:10 whatever non-du jour you want to give it
29:12 there's an element beyond the
29:13 the biomass of a human body and beyond
29:16 the electrical synapses of the human
29:18 brain and the intellect
29:20 that makes each and every one of us
29:22 distinct
29:23 and and i learned that um
29:26 there's there's there's great beauty in
29:28 that and
29:30 um you know coming from up from a hard
29:31 investigator who
29:33 has been always just a fax ma'am kind of
29:35 guy you know there's another aspect to
29:37 being human here
29:38 that um not just me but maybe
29:41 maybe other people have forgotten as
29:43 well and so i want to be able to
29:45 to tell that that story in a very
29:48 elevated way
29:49 and share that with other people and see
29:50 if they have the same
29:52 you know same reaction that that i did i
29:55 would look forward to that coming to
29:56 fruition and
29:57 i think people would be screaming at
29:58 their podcast devices just now
30:01 on a lot of different questions we could
30:02 go off in a tangent with their button
30:04 we'll see if they'll save those for
30:05 another day
30:06 i've made no secret for a long time on
30:08 this podcast lou uh i
30:09 i'm a huge fan of unidentified um the
30:12 tournament struck was perfect it was
30:13 something i was very much looking
30:14 forward to
30:15 um given it seems now there'll be no
30:17 season three um can you speak about what
30:20 you would have liked that to look like
30:22 and i would also like you to comment i
30:23 interviewed antelipe producer of the
30:25 show
30:26 and he mentioned on my interview with
30:27 him that there had been contact with
30:29 people from nasa
30:30 who just weren't quite ready to go on
30:32 the record uh could you comment on that
30:34 as well
30:35 yeah so the two questions um what would
30:37 i like to see in episode three nothing
30:39 um but the answer is simply put nothing
30:41 we we made a decision chris mellon and i
30:43 early on that we only wanted to do two
30:45 seasons
30:46 um that was it was a short relationship
30:49 with history channel they agreed
30:51 this was never intended to be a long
30:54 protracted show
30:55 where we just artificially generate
30:59 material for the sake of having a show
31:02 we it was a target of opportunity uh
31:05 that was never meant to be enduring uh
31:08 we are now working on some of these
31:10 those enduring capabilities but as we
31:12 shift from
31:13 from you know phase one to phase two or
31:15 first gear to second gear
31:17 history had its role and it was very
31:20 impactful and it did exactly what we
31:22 intended it to do
31:24 but make no mistake the history channel
31:26 uh
31:27 effort was not ever it was never
31:28 intended to be a long-term
31:30 uh effort for us it was always a
31:34 short term it was to get the
31:35 conversation going
31:37 and then depending how that went move on
31:39 to something else
31:40 um so that's that's the first part the
31:43 second part you asked me about anthony
31:45 lepay
31:45 and people from nasa look i get emails
31:48 every day it's not just nasa it's nasa
31:50 it's faa it's department of energy
31:52 very very senior people now are finally
31:54 coming forward
31:56 and wanting to have this conversation i
31:59 think it's uh
32:01 and i think it's a good thing um anthony
32:04 lepay is absolutely right but we also
32:05 have people from other countries
32:07 and senior officials in their
32:08 intelligence community
32:10 and their government apparatus coming
32:11 forward and that's i think
32:14 i think it's indicative of the sign of
32:15 the times the conversation is shifting
32:18 and again i want to go back to the ufo
32:20 twitter world because that's in large
32:22 part because of you
32:23 of what you're doing i'm only one voice
32:26 but you guys are many and
32:29 i i think the beauty about this uh is
32:32 that we are no longer
32:33 uh a a if you will an enclave
32:37 i think what you're seeing with ufo
32:39 twitter it's is very quickly becoming an
32:42 army
32:42 uh and that's that's that's a lot
32:45 different it's not a it's becoming a
32:49 i don't know if i want to say the word
32:50 movement because it's used too much
32:52 and movements can sometimes use to be to
32:55 do bad things
32:56 just like they can to be used to do good
32:58 things but in my case
33:00 i think i think the ufo
33:03 twitter universe has has
33:07 helped tremendously in this effort and
33:08 it's getting people to come out
33:10 and talk when you look on twitter i know
33:12 for an absolute fact there are several
33:15 pseudo handles on there that are very
33:17 senior government officials that i
33:18 personally know
33:20 and they create these fake accounts just
33:22 so they can get a pulse so they can so
33:24 they can
33:24 monitor what's going on and that's
33:28 that's remarkable you are helping
33:29 influence right now
33:31 the conversation here in the united
33:34 states that's amazing
33:35 so by the way let me for uh um also
33:38 if i can apologize real quick you hear
33:40 me kind of inhaling a lot um i recently
33:43 got over covet so
33:44 i i still have a little bit of a short
33:46 breath the shortness of breath i
33:47 apologize if it comes across that i just
33:49 finished running a marathon actually
33:51 feels like i just did
33:53 uh so i i apologize i i promise you
33:56 uh i'm i'm not uh working out secretly
33:59 you know
33:59 the table here and trying to get my
34:01 exercise in i just unfortunately it's
34:04 it's part of the um you know the covet
34:06 no absolutely glad you're glad you've
34:07 recovered from that as well and
34:09 you've made no secret you have a petrol
34:10 head you talk about gear one to gear to
34:13 um would it be fair if unidentified was
34:15 part of the first gear
34:16 that the untitled uap project sean
34:19 cahill jeremy mcgivern and you've been
34:21 involved in
34:21 with some of the other guys and
34:22 producers would be part of second gear
34:26 yes absolutely and there's other other
34:27 efforts as well that's just one
34:29 uh we have multiple verticals that we're
34:32 looking at
34:33 to continue the conversation in a much
34:36 more impactful broad way now that the
34:38 topic has finally been taken seriously
34:40 uh i think uh throughout many parts of
34:44 the world
34:45 the time is to put this into into a
34:47 higher gear
34:48 and really as i've always said push the
34:49 pedal to the metal
34:51 i know you don't normally speak for
34:53 other people but i'm going to quote
34:54 someone here and just ask
34:55 for your thoughts at the end of
34:56 unidentified season two chris melin had
34:59 a rather lovely
35:00 monologue to finish off um he said
35:03 that the tech is not ours not russia's
35:06 and not
35:06 china's does this for you definitively
35:09 put to bed the notion that uep
35:12 um they're not made by human hands
35:17 look in order to have a conversation
35:20 with people
35:21 you don't need the elephant in one bite
35:24 you have to you have to
35:25 eat it in bite-size consumable pieces
35:27 that you can then digest otherwise
35:30 you're gonna choke
35:31 um i've said it for the record before we
35:33 are
35:34 we are absolutely sure it's not ours
35:36 we're pretty damn sure it's not
35:39 foreign um you know i i don't know how
35:42 more clear to say that this is
35:45 this is not our technology um if it was
35:48 i i don't think you'd be seeing this
35:50 kind of effort first of all we would
35:51 have figured it out a long time ago
35:53 that this is some sort of russian or
35:54 chinese technology right
35:56 and then we would have had a counter
35:57 technology very quickly
35:59 uh you know it
36:02 no it's it's not ours and i i know it's
36:05 uneasy for people to think about that
36:07 uh but it's okay because it's been here
36:10 for a while
36:11 and we're still here and religions
36:13 haven't collapsed and and
36:14 governments haven't imploded uh this is
36:17 just another wondrous mystery of the
36:18 universe
36:20 and with that comes some some hope and
36:22 opportunity but also you know
36:24 we have to exercise some some some
36:27 due diligence and and pragmatic
36:30 caution here you know i i'm not the kind
36:32 of guy that's just going to go
36:34 running into a into a dark room uh
36:37 with my hands in the air you know and
36:39 and
36:40 blindly because you bump into things i
36:43 think we need to approach this like we
36:44 do everything else very cautiously
36:47 um you know we know the moon is right
36:49 there but yet we don't just throw people
36:50 in rockets and send them to the moon
36:52 you know there's a lot that has to
36:53 happen to to
36:55 to to do that and i think to some degree
36:58 this may be kind of similar
37:00 in that uh you know there's
37:03 there's we have to be very careful
37:06 cautious
37:06 and deliberate in uh how we
37:10 we ask the questions and and the answers
37:12 that we get back
37:14 um we're it's very tempting for us to
37:16 all go down the rabbit hole very quickly
37:18 and think we have the answer
37:19 i see it all the time and my word of
37:21 caution to that is
37:22 please please please try your best
37:26 to to to be victim of your own analytic
37:30 bias
37:30 i look i i i suffer from it just like
37:33 everybody else
37:34 i'm no superhero i had the same same
37:38 challenges when i when i see something i
37:40 had this temptation to to jump to a
37:42 conclusion oh it must be that
37:43 and that's the way the human brain is
37:45 wired that's a human thing
37:47 the very first thing we do coming out of
37:48 our mother's womb is recognizes
37:50 we recognize her sound and her face and
37:52 her touch we
37:53 are programmed as a species to recognize
37:57 patterns and identify friend or foe that
37:59 is
38:00 what nature has evolved us to be
38:03 and so it's natural that when you come
38:05 up to
38:06 to an enigma like this and you get some
38:08 answers
38:09 that we want to jump to conclusions of
38:11 what something is or is not
38:13 but we really have to we have to be very
38:16 careful and not be tempted
38:18 to do that prematurely we really need to
38:20 let the scientific
38:22 process and methodologies work and
38:25 and i think once we can do that we we
38:28 may have some
38:29 you know surprises some some
38:31 surprisingly
38:32 uh simple answers
38:36 you've you've led me very nicely into
38:38 this next question because i'm actually
38:39 going to throw back at you
38:40 a question you once asked on a piece
38:43 you've done the youtube videos out there
38:45 i'm not too sure of the context behind
38:46 it but
38:47 it was certainly something that stuck
38:48 with me and a lot of other people as
38:50 well
38:50 and you asked once for people to
38:52 consider what if it wasn't mankind
38:54 but mankind's and what would that mean
38:57 for us
38:58 could you elaborate on that because
38:59 that's something people go back to more
39:01 and more
39:02 and as more or less hypothetical that's
39:04 what i'm going to put it as but
39:06 people would assume you come from a
39:08 better understanding a place of
39:09 knowledge
39:10 than most would um
39:14 yeah wow uh
39:18 well you're getting some really really
39:19 good and personal questions um
39:22 let me see if i can answer that in a
39:24 meaningful way without
39:26 um
39:29 without leading leading the witness
39:34 we live in a three-dimensional world
39:37 we live in a three-dimensional world
39:39 where time is a function of the fourth
39:40 dimension if you will
39:42 and we experience time as being linear
39:44 it's a linear function or a process
39:47 uh but we now know in the quantum world
39:50 that time first of all we know that
39:53 space and time
39:54 because of the work of einstein and
39:56 others that space and time are are
39:57 joined together
39:59 and we know that space time is flexible
40:01 it's called relativity we see it around
40:03 massive objects all the time not just
40:04 earth but the sun black holes
40:07 so the linear universe that
40:10 we experience to some degree really
40:13 isn't
40:14 and when you look at the quantum state
40:16 of things even an electron for example
40:19 you learn in high school that an
40:21 electron orbits an atom and we now know
40:23 that's really
40:24 a very simplistic way of looking at
40:25 things that the electron doesn't orbit
40:27 around the atom in fact it's called an
40:29 electron cloud because
40:30 the electron is is both all in all
40:34 places and none of the places all at the
40:36 same time it's it's kind of weird but
40:38 my point being is that if you were to
40:40 look at time and think of a
40:42 think of a cigarette burning when you
40:44 look at the notion of the future
40:46 most people would would define the
40:47 future as those events that have not yet
40:50 happened
40:51 and the past is defined by events that
40:53 have already happened
40:54 and when you look at that construct then
40:56 the definition of the present
40:58 must be a a moment in space time
41:00 probably measured in playing time very
41:02 infinitesimal
41:04 infinitesimally small moment of space
41:07 time
41:08 where the future is transitioning into
41:10 the past it's it's
41:11 it's it's not a point in time it's a
41:14 process it's an event
41:15 that's occurring so a way to look at
41:17 that in late perspective is think of a
41:19 cigarette
41:20 or a cigar that parts of this cigar that
41:23 have already burnt or the cigarette that
41:25 have already burnt the ash
41:26 is the past that part of the cigarette
41:29 or cigar that has not yet burned
41:31 is the future and the cherry that moment
41:33 of ignition
41:35 that spark of where the future is now be
41:38 getting consumed and becoming the past
41:40 that is the present and we as human
41:42 beings we live
41:43 at that moment all of our hopes our
41:45 fears our memories love hate good
41:47 bad all that is an expression
41:50 of of an experience that occurs uh
41:53 at an infinitesimally small moment of
41:56 space time
41:56 like i said probably measured in playing
41:58 time
42:00 that is how we we we we experience the
42:03 present but what if
42:04 there were things that had the ability
42:09 to
42:09 experience where where the present was a
42:11 much bigger
42:12 cherry if you will a much bigger
42:14 transition where more elements of the
42:16 future in the past
42:18 are experienced as in the present and
42:21 can do that also physically right
42:22 so it's not just not just
42:25 a an idea but what if there were
42:29 species out there that that experienced
42:31 the universe
42:32 uh in it with it with an extra level of
42:34 dimension
42:35 and so you and i are having this
42:37 conversation right now with your
42:38 audience
42:39 and we're having this conversation right
42:40 here right now but if
42:42 i were to have the ability to have this
42:44 conversation right here but five minutes
42:45 ago
42:46 or five minutes from now we would never
42:48 meet we'd be like two ships passing in
42:50 the night
42:51 um is it possible that maybe some of
42:54 these things
42:55 these uap have the ability uh we
42:57 experience in them
42:58 we we experience them when they are
43:00 right here right now
43:01 and every other every other time we we
43:04 don't because we're simply not
43:05 intersecting
43:06 uh with that with that uh extra
43:09 dimensional
43:10 space of of time um you know when you
43:13 look at that cigarette or cigar
43:15 burning you'll notice that it never
43:18 burns evenly
43:19 when you look at it up close and you can
43:21 kind of remove the glare and the flare
43:22 from the
43:23 from the burn we we realized that that
43:26 there are portions of the future of the
43:29 portions of the cigar
43:31 that haven't burned yet uh behind
43:34 portions of the cigar that already has
43:35 burned
43:36 it's it's not an even burn almost
43:40 there's an overlap right and quantum
43:42 theory uh
43:43 is beginning to to show some of the
43:45 models for that
43:46 so um i know i'm going in a very
43:49 long-winded roundabout way to answer
43:51 your question about what i meant about
43:52 mankind's
43:54 but i guess my answer to that is it's
43:56 limitless we
43:58 every time we put a limitation on mother
44:01 nature
44:01 she defies our our box
44:05 she defies the parameters for which we
44:07 set every time we say every living thing
44:09 needs
44:09 water or oxygen we realize that there
44:12 are our
44:14 microbial life out there that that are
44:16 anaerobic
44:17 they in fact they'll die if you put
44:18 oxygen they they like a non-oxidated
44:21 environment
44:22 right you have these extremophiles
44:23 living at the bottom of the ocean
44:25 and and and miles below the the arctic
44:29 ice
44:30 this defies any any definition of life
44:33 in fact a virus itself
44:35 in one case you can make the
44:38 the i think you can make the claim that
44:41 it is a living organism because it
44:43 replicates
44:44 and it does a lot of things that a
44:46 living organism does
44:48 but it also can be defined as a
44:51 non-living thing because it doesn't have
44:53 dna and it doesn't have a lot of the
44:56 things
44:56 that we clearly associate associate with
44:59 a living organism
45:00 like respiratory functions right like uh
45:04 anabolic activity so i think we need to
45:07 be very cautious how we define
45:09 life a long time ago we used to defy
45:13 define life uh as mammals birds and fish
45:17 well you know that's probably a very
45:19 over simplistic view of what life is
45:21 we're spending billions of dollars
45:24 through nasa trying to find microbial
45:26 life right now
45:28 on some of our our planets in our own
45:29 solar system and moons
45:31 because it is it is it we think that
45:33 there's a very good possibility that
45:35 exists
45:36 seti does the same thing with radio
45:38 transmissions trying to find
45:40 a signature of life out there and what
45:43 we're beginning to find out it that
45:44 it is more likely than not that there is
45:47 life out there
45:48 and that life might be fairly abundant
45:52 um so uh boy
45:55 um that's one hell of a question you
45:57 asked me
45:58 well that was one hell of an answer and
46:00 just given the answer of giving is
46:02 i want to actually finish off this
46:03 portion of the interview with the time
46:05 we have left to try and get some
46:06 listener questions in soon as well
46:08 talking a little bit about your past and
46:10 actually the future as well
46:11 as well knowing you resigned from your
46:13 position at a tip
46:14 that was to try and push forward this
46:16 conversation to the by the public
46:18 a lot of people including myself would
46:19 thank you for doing that i would like to
46:21 know
46:22 how it made you feel having to resign
46:23 from that position
46:25 that's not something i've heard anyone
46:26 ask you before
46:28 well it was the toughest toughest
46:30 decision i ever made in my life
46:34 it was my you know there's there's
46:38 two components that that make up luis
46:41 elizondo there is the private component
46:44 uh as a family family man and a father
46:47 and then there is my my other component
46:50 that i
46:51 feel for me as as as a patriot to my
46:53 country
46:54 and uh i i i believe in the idea
47:04 i'm sorry i apologize that's okay that's
47:07 okay
47:08 that wasn't deliberate i promise no i
47:09 know what you know i i
47:12 i i believe in a life of service
47:15 um i believe in leaving this country and
47:18 this world in a little bit better shape
47:19 than you found it
47:21 and uh you know i don't expect everybody
47:23 to feel that way
47:24 just to me i do because of the way i was
47:26 brought up and my my
47:27 the the struggles my family had to go
47:29 through even just to be in this country
47:30 so
47:32 so for me it's it's um it's a very
47:36 sincere and and uh profound
47:40 commitment i have and so when i left the
47:43 government you know
47:47 in one hand i felt like i was abandoning
47:49 the very establishment
47:52 that that i was committed to to serve
47:54 the american people
47:55 you know by de facto i felt like i was
47:57 abandoning the american people because i
47:59 was doing jobs that were very important
48:02 for the government and for the american
48:04 people
48:05 but in order to serve the american
48:06 people i actually had to leave the
48:08 organization that i love to do it
48:10 in order to i realized that i'm going to
48:13 have to make a choice do i serve the
48:15 institution that i belong to
48:16 or do i serve the american people and i
48:20 realized that that in order to serve the
48:22 american people i would have to leave
48:24 the organization the institution
48:26 that i was serving to serve the american
48:28 people
48:29 um it was extremely tough for me
48:32 um it's you know uh you can't see this
48:35 but on my desk i have all these
48:37 around my office here my moment you know
48:39 i'll show you just for a quick second
48:41 give your audience a quick tour here i
48:42 don't do this very often but
48:44 uh let me see if i can do this for a
48:46 second
48:47 um you can see very quickly uh
48:50 a lot of my
48:54 my life is in these walls and uh
48:57 you know it's it's part of part of who i
48:59 am and uh to
49:02 to leave that is very was very
49:05 challenging was very tough
49:07 um i
49:11 i mean i don't know what else to say
49:12 it's uh well with that action
49:15 that that you took and it was a big
49:16 decision that affected your life your
49:18 family your future
49:19 you started a sequence of events and a
49:21 ball rolling which
49:22 you'll be you're more than humble enough
49:24 to see other people were heavily
49:25 involved in with you as well
49:27 so we are now counting down 144 days as
49:30 of recording uh my co-host dan got that
49:32 for me
49:33 to seeing a declassified report from the
49:36 uap task force
49:37 you have spoken several times now that
49:39 we're in good hands with those
49:40 overseeing this
49:41 why should people be excited about the
49:44 report coming out but also beyond that
49:46 what can we expect to come from the task
49:48 force itself
49:51 okay great question um let me let me try
49:54 to get you
49:55 a a a comprehensive and meaningful
49:58 response
50:00 uh i think it is a
50:04 tremendous accomplishment that uh
50:08 congress has asked the director of
50:09 national intelligence for a 180 50:12 180 day report um
50:15 it it shows that there is commitment and
50:18 interest by congress
50:19 and that there's a willingness by the
50:21 executive branch of the government
50:22 so that's that that is a win scenario
50:25 right there
50:26 the question is a is 180 days long
50:30 enough
50:31 to provide a comprehensive report that
50:33 congress deserves
50:35 and two will all the relevant
50:37 information be in there
50:38 in order for congress to make informed
50:40 decisions
50:41 um if it was up to me
50:45 i would probably request a 180-day
50:48 extension now i know people right now
50:49 are going to be probably
50:51 lining up with pitchforks wanting to uh
50:53 to burn my house down
50:55 but as i've said before there's a
50:57 difference between doing something right
50:59 and doing it right now and i prefer we
51:02 got one shot to do this right
51:03 so uh we've come this far we we've
51:06 waited this long
51:08 i you know i i wouldn't be opposed to a
51:10 to a little bit longer just to make sure
51:12 that
51:13 we get it right there's a lot happening
51:14 between covid
51:16 of course the pandemic and then of
51:18 course we have a new administration
51:20 coming in and they're trying to
51:21 get their feet on the ground the
51:22 transition process takes at least 180 51:25 days
51:26 uh and of course we still have you know
51:28 our regular jobs trying to protect this
51:30 country
51:31 so um you know i'm not sure
51:35 i'm not sure as you say now 144 days
51:38 is is is long enough i'm not sure that
51:42 we have
51:43 a a an adequate structure within a task
51:47 force
51:47 to answer the mail on that i think what
51:49 we need is a permanent capability
51:51 not just a task force uh that is that is
51:55 properly resourced with with the right
51:58 talent
51:59 uh and and the right authorities to do
52:01 what it needs to look the people the
52:02 task force are amazing human beings
52:03 they're friends of mine
52:04 dear friends i'll go to combat tomorrow
52:07 with them
52:08 and i'll die with them but they've been
52:11 given an impossible task
52:13 they've been in to some degree the same
52:15 task that i was given
52:17 uh when i was in at it's it's
52:20 it's it's not enough
52:24 you can't expect just a handful of
52:25 people to provide this information that
52:28 has historically been been sitting with
52:30 within 17 different intelligence
52:32 agencies
52:33 uh in various little pockets and
52:36 enclaves
52:37 for decades i mean it takes longer to
52:40 build a house
52:41 than it does to in this case than 180 52:44 days and we're expecting
52:46 a a comprehensive government whole
52:48 government approach to this to this
52:50 topic
52:51 um you know if to me if you were to ask
52:54 me i think i think the task force is
52:55 being set up for failure
52:56 and not by congress and i don't think
52:58 it's deliberate i think i think we need
53:00 to take a step back
53:01 and i think we really need to to assess
53:04 what is it we're trying to achieve
53:06 and then let's set up these people for
53:07 success you know if we really want the
53:09 right answers well
53:10 then we got to be prepared to to
53:15 to give them the necessary resources to
53:17 do this
53:18 otherwise you know all you're doing is
53:20 setting up a bunch of patriots for
53:22 failure and
53:22 and and putting frustration into the
53:25 system
53:27 lou just to get a couple of lister
53:29 questions and i've got one more question
53:30 for you
53:31 if you're part and all of this ended
53:33 tomorrow would you be satisfied
53:37 you know i wish well i wish my part
53:40 would end tomorrow
53:42 um i'm pretty tired i'm pretty tired
53:46 i've you know i don't know how much more
53:49 i can i can really give i've given
53:51 you know my life savings to this and
53:53 i've given
53:54 my relationships to this um
53:58 you know uh would i be satisfied
54:02 um i haven't had the opportunity or the
54:05 luxury to sit back and really
54:08 relish in the accomplishments we've
54:10 we've collectively achieved
54:11 so uh i've been too focused on the
54:13 mission
54:14 um i will say something that's been very
54:16 heartfelt um
54:19 i shared this with some very close
54:20 friends of mine i was looking on twitter
54:23 and some
54:23 some people in an incredible uh
54:26 gesture of kindness offered to set up a
54:28 um
54:30 a gofundme page or something like that
54:31 where they were going to you know
54:32 contribute because
54:34 i guess the cat's gotten out of the bag
54:36 that i've i've
54:38 put my life savings into this because
54:40 you know it's it's a
54:42 it's an endeavor that doesn't make money
54:44 you know if you're looking to make money
54:45 this is not the topic to pursue at least
54:47 not right now
54:48 um my i i am truly
54:52 profoundly humbled by that gesture but
54:54 let me also say this
54:56 if you want to honor what what i what
54:59 what i'm doing you want to honor any
55:00 sacrifice that i've made in this
55:03 don't spend money on me take that money
55:06 that you have
55:07 take your your your wife your husband
55:09 your boyfriend your girlfriends your
55:11 kids
55:12 take them to a dinner spend time with
55:14 them
55:15 and and just connect and and and be a
55:19 family
55:20 um you want to honor me that would be
55:22 the the best
55:23 best way to honor me don't don't don't
55:25 set anything up for me
55:27 you know i i i can i can go work at a
55:30 supermarket if i need to
55:31 i gotta return wrenches right i can i
55:34 can
55:34 fix cars um this journey is not about me
55:38 it's about the collect of
55:39 all of us uh i i would be i would be
55:43 much happier if you were to to save your
55:45 hard-earned money
55:46 and and you know uh
55:50 go to a nice dinner with your family and
55:52 and talk about things that are important
55:53 maybe talk about uaps
55:55 right that'd be a great way yeah my kids
55:58 like lying on the trampoline looking at
55:59 the stars and they're they're foreign
56:00 two
56:01 and they've got their little toilet roll
56:03 holders they've got they've made for
56:04 binoculars to pretend to look for aliens
56:06 so
56:07 they're on the way to carry on that
56:08 conversation look so many people you're
56:10 a very popular character and i know
56:12 that's something you tend to shy away
56:13 from the attention that you get as well
56:15 you don't crave it
56:16 which i think draws a lot of people to
56:18 you as well unfortunately
56:19 so many people wrote in with questions
56:21 i've just like to put a couple of those
56:22 to you and then a
56:23 60-second quick fire and craig labadie
56:26 mentioned during your recent interview
56:28 with john greenwald you mentioned there
56:29 were certain
56:30 certain videos that had blown your mind
56:32 you talked about doing mental gymnastics
56:34 to work out how a particular object
56:36 have could have done the maneuvers it
56:37 done so his question for you
56:40 are those types of videos and that type
56:42 of data held by multiple governments
56:44 is that rare or is that data more common
56:47 than one might think
56:48 i think you'll be surprised that that
56:50 data might be more common than you think
56:54 the problem is there were never really
56:55 any mechanisms to do anything with that
56:57 data
56:57 so they are they are in in
57:00 um bits and pieces if you will uh
57:03 throughout uh different governments but
57:06 uh yeah there's some very
57:08 there's some very compelling data um you
57:11 know in some cases
57:12 you get these things 50 feet away from
57:14 the cockpit i mean that's
57:17 at that point there ain't no question
57:18 what you're looking at um so
57:21 i have to ask you this one from doug
57:23 campbell regarding something i read or
57:25 heard possibly on a podcast
57:27 um it stated at one point that you had
57:29 considered being a psychic spy
57:31 is that at all true and have you ever
57:33 practiced remote viewing
57:37 damn uh you know how
57:40 how put off and i are are good friends
57:44 um hal and his colleagues were involved
57:47 in some remarkable stuff
57:49 uh um project stargate
57:52 before that grill flame and whatnot it's
57:54 no surprise that the
57:55 department of the army and at some point
57:57 the defense intelligence agency
57:59 were were involved in that effort um
58:03 i uh i i'm not going to elaborate
58:07 um great question uh maybe maybe for
58:10 some other time
58:11 i like that one too and the last
58:12 listener question sorry to everyone who
58:14 i didn't get to hopefully the body of
58:15 the interview answered some as well
58:17 but like lou said hopefully comes back
58:18 one day to answer some more
58:20 uh leif asked was there any particular
58:22 reason that the three videos that were
58:24 released to gimbal go fast and flare
58:26 were the ones that were chosen to be
58:28 released
58:30 yes good answer i won't probe you
58:33 further on that i feel that would be a
58:35 bit fruitless uh listen
58:36 quick fire round before we let you go a
58:38 couple of topics and subjects we've not
58:40 managed to talk about yet or talk too
58:42 much on
58:42 you can say a word a couple of words in
58:44 a sentence it's up to you
58:46 the first one is skin walker wrench
58:50 um a very
58:54 perplexing place uh
58:59 i have the utmost respect for the men
59:02 and women that were involved in that
59:03 project
59:05 next one is bob lazar i've never met the
59:09 gentleman
59:10 i have no comment either way i
59:13 i have absolutely
59:16 zero interaction with mr lazar as
59:19 a human being uh both personally and
59:22 professionally so therefore i i
59:24 i reserve my comment because i simply
59:26 don't i don't have an opinion i'm not
59:27 i don't have an opinion either way and
59:30 i'm just keeping it to myself i truly
59:31 don't have an opinion it's never been
59:33 factored into my calculus certainly ce5 59:39 if it works it works if it doesn't it
59:40 doesn't i have a hard problem
59:43 personal problem with with anybody
59:45 charging for
59:46 for for services uh
59:49 you know it's it's uh for me um
59:53 this is not a money-making endeavor i
59:55 think i think
59:56 we pervert the truth when we do make it
59:59 a money-making endeavor
60:00 i think um all sorts of things
60:04 get introduced into the mix when this
60:06 becomes about
60:07 profit and that's with anybody
60:11 you know i i'm not saying you have to
60:13 starve and and
60:14 you know but but profiting off of other
60:17 people
60:18 in search for the truth i find
60:21 despicable
60:22 um you know that's one of the reasons
60:24 why i don't really do entertainment i
60:26 prefer doing
60:27 infotainment and i don't mind
60:28 information being entertaining
60:30 but entertainment for the sake of
60:32 entertainment i'm that's not me i'm not
60:34 an entertainer
60:35 i i want to help inform um
60:39 i think uh you know there are a lot of
60:41 as i said before hucksters and
60:42 fraudsters out there
60:44 and it's coming to light and you know
60:47 people are there's some savvy
60:48 investigators now or that are hot on the
60:50 trail of some of these individuals who
60:51 spent the last
60:52 several years if not decades defrauding
60:55 people
60:56 and uh you know all i gotta say is uh
60:59 you know sucks to be you you shouldn't
61:01 have done that shame on you
61:02 um you know the truth
61:06 i i said this years ago you know there's
61:08 something
61:09 funny about the truth um
61:13 the truth she sometimes whispers
61:16 so you have to listen carefully but if
61:19 but but she
61:20 she always speaks and ultimately the
61:23 truth always comes out
61:24 so uh my advice would be for anybody if
61:27 if you're into ce5 61:29 if that's a real thing then great and i
61:32 would ask that you'd be able to
61:33 demonstrate it
61:34 in front of a camera in front of a large
61:36 audience um
61:37 and repeat it right scientific method
61:39 make it make it repeatable and something
61:41 that can be peer reviewed otherwise
61:43 it's just your opinion i would ask does
61:46 the truth whisper mankind or mankind's
61:51 well well uh
61:52 [Applause]
61:56 how about you tell me abigail mankind
62:01 that's with plural with the s uh i think
62:04 i i think i think i would too i think
62:06 that's
62:07 and louie to finish up the show
62:09 appreciating your time what does
62:10 disclosure mean to you
62:12 ah well
62:17 i think we'll know it when we see it uh
62:20 i think we're in the process of
62:21 disclosure right now i think in five
62:22 years when we look back we're going to
62:24 realize we're in the middle of
62:25 disclosure
62:25 um i said before disclosure is a process
62:28 it's not an event
62:29 um i think uh
62:33 disclosure means a a willingness to
62:36 recognize the truth
62:40 and begin to discuss
62:44 facts in a way that is transparent
62:48 and open for all people to participate
62:51 in
62:52 all people not just one institution not
62:55 just one government not just one country
62:58 everybody and i think that is what
63:01 disclosure is about
63:02 it's the recognition that the earth is
63:04 not at the center of the solar system
63:07 and you know sometimes it's it's hard to
63:10 tell that truth
63:11 in the beginning but ultimately it
63:13 becomes self-evident
63:15 and i think we are in that process now i
63:18 think we are
63:19 in the throes of realizing that the
63:20 earth is not in the center
63:22 of our solar system um
63:25 and again with that i think there's
63:27 there's a lot of hope i think there's a
63:28 lot of
63:29 opportunity there but let's not jump to
63:32 conclusions
63:33 you know let's let's maintain the course
63:36 of being
63:37 diligent and deliberate methodical uh
63:40 and and you know open-minded to to the
63:43 best of our ability
63:44 while trying to maintain um
63:47 our our dedication to the scientific
63:50 process
63:51 lou it's been an honor genuinely and a
63:53 pleasure speaking to you
63:55 and i look forward to the day i can
63:56 welcome you back on again for that
63:58 second part
63:59 anytime i will tell you this is a true
64:01 true pleasure for me i want to answer
64:03 one question for you that you haven't
64:05 asked
64:05 but i know some of your viewers are
64:07 asking why am i doing these podcasts
64:10 why am i is there an attempt by me is
64:13 there a media blitz that i'm involved
64:14 with in order to
64:16 achieve something well the answer is yes
64:19 and that yes is that um
64:23 part of phase two from my opinion is
64:25 getting the word out to anybody and
64:27 everybody as you know i don't make a
64:28 penny doing these
64:29 i don't charge anybody i don't get an
64:31 appearance fee for doing this
64:33 it takes a lot of time on my day but i
64:35 do it because it's important
64:38 i do it because it is making a
64:40 difference we're finally having the
64:41 conversation and even if you disagree
64:43 with my perspective
64:44 it's okay because the conversation is
64:46 still happening even if you don't agree
64:48 with with
64:49 how i'm doing things and the way we're
64:51 doing things that's still good
64:53 that's okay because you don't have to
64:54 agree with me you don't have to
64:56 be in my camp or my team
64:59 i don't need that i just need you having
65:01 the conversation and it's happening
65:03 so uh you know my hats off really to you
65:06 and to your listeners thank you for what
65:08 you do
65:09 uh thank you for what your listeners uh

==========8vdOKX_MJ0w==========

00:00 [Music]
00:14 hmm
00:18 hello my name is max moskowicz and this
00:20 is my podcast
00:22 fighting with muskridge or in dutch
00:24 victim at moscovic
00:25 we are doing this podcast out of
00:27 amsterdam the netherlands
00:29 and uh we have been focusing on the uap
00:32 phenomena because we're making a whole
00:35 edition about
00:35 the uap phenomena for new review
00:38 magazine which is a dutch magazine
00:40 and we get to be the rebellious ones who
00:43 are
00:44 actually addressing this very important
00:45 topic and today
00:47 we are talking to uh former man in
00:49 charge of the
00:50 a8 tip program uh for the pentagon
00:54 mr louis elizondo he was a former secret
00:57 service guy he was chasing terrorists
01:00 from 2008 up until uh 2017 he was in
01:04 charge of investigating
01:06 ufos uabs and everything surrounding
01:09 that subject
01:10 this is a very open and uh
01:13 honest interview louis did with me you
01:16 might hear some
01:17 really new things about the uap
01:19 phenomena and what we can expect in the
01:21 future
01:22 or maybe what hasn't been said in the
01:24 past so
01:26 uh enjoyed this uh interview and
01:30 i hope you uh you know get educated um
01:35 so three years ago the
01:38 the pentagon released these images and
01:41 you must get this question a lot
01:45 bro there's a whole fleet of them look
01:48 on the sa
01:50 my gosh girl going
01:54 against the wind the wind's 120 miles
01:56 west
01:59 i understand that it was actually you
02:02 who
02:03 decided to uh release those images
02:07 is that true to some degree that is true
02:10 it was actually a mutual decision inside
02:12 my office
02:13 uh because i was the senior ranking
02:16 person at the time
02:17 obviously the responsibility fell to me
02:19 and the request was initiated by me
02:22 uh but it was a mutual decision by by
02:25 all of us inside the a-tip program at
02:27 the time
02:28 to try to establish a a repository
02:32 a library if you will at the
02:34 unclassified level
02:36 that would allow uh some of the the
02:39 scientific minds outside of the
02:41 department of defense to maybe look at
02:43 some of these videos
02:44 and help us determine what they are but
02:47 it was
02:48 it was my name on the official
02:50 documentation
02:52 to to release those videos that is
02:54 correct
02:55 up front now the former pentagon
02:56 military official who ran the covert
02:58 government program up until this last
02:59 november
03:00 luis elizondo luis thank you so much for
03:02 your time tonight
03:04 i mean first tell us what the purpose of
03:06 the program was and why it was so
03:08 secretive
03:09 sure the purpose of the program
03:12 advanced aerospace threat identification
03:14 program
03:15 was really designed to do just that
03:18 from a national security perspective
03:21 identify
03:22 those things that we see whether
03:25 we see them electro-optically we see
03:26 them with radar we see them
03:29 as as eyewitness reports
03:32 through a myriad of different ways and
03:34 avenues that we receive the information
03:36 and try to ascertain and determine if
03:38 that information
03:40 is a potential threat to national
03:41 security you you were running aa tip
03:45 is that true you you were in charge yes
03:48 sir
03:49 i was uh but to be to be completely
03:52 honest and forthcoming
03:53 there were a lot of very very talented
03:55 people that i had the opportunity to
03:57 work with
03:58 and although i was the senior ranking
04:01 person
04:01 a lot of the decision making we made was
04:04 based upon consensus this was a very
04:08 important topic
04:09 and i don't think any of us had all the
04:12 answers
04:13 so it was important whenever we made a a
04:15 major decision
04:16 that we made that decision as a group
04:19 okay
04:19 uh i'm gonna start this off with
04:21 questions you probably get a lot but i i
04:23 will move towards
04:25 because you know i have a a public that
04:28 doesn't know
04:29 anything yet you know it's basically the
04:31 situation here
04:33 um so uh can you tell me a little bit
04:36 more
04:36 uh about aa tip you were probably
04:40 screened and selected to to to run this
04:44 why did they choose you to do this
04:47 were you experienced in that field of
04:50 uap
04:51 ufo yeah no actually i i wasn't at all
04:55 initially when i was asked to to come on
04:57 board the program
04:59 it wasn't in the capacity as as the
05:01 leader it was
05:02 the capacity to provide security and
05:05 counter intelligence
05:06 support my background as a
05:08 counterintelligence investigator
05:11 i spent much time of my career
05:14 chasing terrorists and spies and as a
05:17 result of that
05:18 uh they they needed a good
05:20 counter-intelligence
05:22 representative inside the portfolio to
05:25 make sure that our foreign adversaries
05:26 hadn't penetrated
05:27 uh our operational security furthermore
05:31 i did have some background early on in
05:33 my career as a young special agent
05:36 i did some work in advanced aerospace
05:38 technologies primarily technology
05:40 protection so
05:42 uh advanced unmanned aerial vehicles um
05:46 some of the the guidance systems for our
05:49 cruise missile technology
05:51 uh icbms uh intercontinental ballistic
05:54 missiles
05:55 and some some avionics and so i suspect
05:58 it's because of that background
06:00 that they asked me initially to come on
06:02 board in 2008 06:04 it wasn't until 2010 that it was asked
06:07 to assume the lead role
06:09 okay um and
06:12 before you started uh that job did you
06:14 have any
06:15 uh experience with uaps or ufos
06:21 and in fact i never even had the luxury
06:23 to think about them i remember
06:24 distinctly on my
06:26 my interview uh with the the former
06:29 director before i became the director he
06:31 was interviewing me and i still had no
06:32 idea what
06:33 what the what the portfolio
06:36 what the what the job was about
06:40 and he asked me uh i remember this he
06:42 asked me point blank he asked me
06:43 straight to my face and said what do you
06:45 think about ufos
06:46 and my response was i i don't and he
06:50 asked me well what do you mean you don't
06:51 you don't believe in ufos and i said no
06:53 sir i didn't say that
06:55 what i said is i i don't have the luxury
06:57 to think about them i'm i'm too
06:58 preoccupied with my regular job which is
07:01 finding and chasing bad guys you know
07:03 i'm not really
07:04 i never had the luxury to to think about
07:07 ufos uh whether they exist or not
07:10 is something i never really pondered
07:11 because i never really had the time
07:13 when you were briefed on on the job um
07:17 that must have been an awkward
07:20 experience to to
07:21 you know yeah that's one way to put it
07:26 yeah so it was uh go ahead oh no i i
07:30 just wanted to know what you were
07:31 feeling at that moment
07:34 uh i'm gonna put this on do not disturb
07:35 so i can i can talk to you i apologize
07:37 my phone keeps ringing um
07:39 you know initially when he when he
07:41 mentioned that
07:43 and i began to realize what the
07:44 portfolio was about i wasn't sure if it
07:46 was a test
07:47 to see if maybe i was psychologically
07:49 unstable to see if i was prone to
07:51 to uh psychological flights of fancy
07:56 so i was just honest you know and again
07:58 my response was exactly how i felt i
08:00 never really thought about ufos
08:02 as i began to learn more about the
08:04 portfolio and see a lot of the evidence
08:07 i began to realize
08:08 that the evidence was very compelling
08:10 and that the topic was very real
08:12 keep in mind that my background as a as
08:15 a special agent
08:16 was very much in my country we call it
08:19 just the facts ma'am
08:21 kind of kind of person where i'm not
08:23 interested in suppositions or what you
08:25 think or what you
08:26 feel i'm interested only in the facts
08:28 you know what what
08:29 what does the data reveal what can we
08:31 see what can we
08:33 collect what can we intercept what can
08:36 we
08:36 record and then use that information
08:39 to make a logical conclusion in this
08:42 particular case
08:43 you have uh what what's so compelling to
08:46 me is that you have highly trained
08:48 observers pilots that we spend literally
08:52 literally millions of dollars each year
08:54 in training these individuals
08:56 some of them go to the very best schools
08:58 like top gun
09:00 and in fact i'll show something i'll
09:01 share something with you and your
09:02 audience here
09:03 yes please this is an example
09:07 of our trained observers the the the
09:09 training
09:10 type they do so this is a profile these
09:12 are our us
09:13 government's cards on identifying
09:16 foreign military aircraft and you have
09:18 to be able to identify these aircraft
09:21 from all different angles from all
09:23 different sides all different
09:24 perspectives
09:25 and that's why our pilots and those also
09:28 in your country
09:28 are able to identify a su-22 versus a
09:32 mig-25 versus an
09:33 f you know 16 or a european tornado
09:37 from 20 miles away because of
09:39 silhouettes they're trained to recognize
09:42 furthermore when you have a pilot
09:45 reporting something that they've never
09:46 seen before that can outperform anything
09:49 that we have
09:51 which is further substantiated by by
09:53 video evidence
09:54 gun camera footage which is then further
09:58 uh validated by radar data and by the
10:00 way not just one radar multiple radars
10:02 in different locations
10:04 you now have three separate collection
10:06 sensor units
10:07 the human being being one of them three
10:09 collection sensor units
10:11 you have radar cameras and pilots
10:14 all reporting the same thing at the same
10:18 time
10:18 at the same location under the same
10:21 circumstances
10:22 so if this were to be a a court of law
10:26 uh we would in from our perspective be
10:30 well beyond
10:30 reasonable doubt the jury would have to
10:32 convict this is
10:34 this is a real thing operating in in
10:36 real space and time
10:38 um and that for me i think was probably
10:41 the most compelling because what we were
10:42 seeing
10:44 was the technology was was sufficiently
10:48 advanced beyond our our our current not
10:51 only our current capabilities but our
10:52 current understanding
10:54 of aerodynamics and physics yes
10:57 um so these these pilots and it was it
11:00 wasn't just like
11:01 five guys who were like you know dozens
11:03 of guys who
11:04 who uh were witness uh to uaps
11:08 uh so they what you are looking at
11:11 is facts right so you have okay they
11:14 were observed with
11:15 senses with eyes ears then you have data
11:19 you know uh so what pops up on the radar
11:22 satellite
11:23 um and camera
11:26 is there also signals you can uh uh
11:30 observe or hear or uh trace
11:33 that is a great question great question
11:37 uh unfortunately i have to be very
11:39 careful what i say here
11:41 what you're referring to is what we call
11:42 signatures collection
11:45 the the collection of data resulting
11:47 from an
11:48 object moving through space and time
11:50 whether it's electronic signature
11:52 or it's a physical signature like heat
11:54 ablation or atmospheric ionization
11:57 or acoustic signatures like sonic booms
12:00 those are all things that we consider
12:01 unfortunately i can't go into a lot of
12:03 detail on those
12:05 but yes that is certainly very relevant
12:08 having more collection sensors with more
12:11 capability
12:12 to collect the data is obviously going
12:15 to give you a more compelling picture of
12:17 what's going on
12:18 yeah i can't again comment specifically
12:22 what type of sensors we might or might
12:23 not have used
12:24 but but you're you're absolutely correct
12:26 um you know
12:30 and if i would just throw out a word
12:32 gravity
12:36 yeah that's uh that's a good one for
12:38 sure
12:39 yeah thank you yeah that's uh
12:43 yeah that's um very very relevant
12:46 i'll leave it at that but you're that's
12:48 uh yep you're you're out you're
12:50 you're obviously tracking thank you sir
12:53 thank you
12:54 i'm gonna drop this subject uh for you
12:57 um let me see
13:01 um oh yeah i i think i want to ask you
13:05 um
13:06 when you started the job um were you
13:09 briefed on
13:10 uh the files uh that were before you uh
13:14 i mean did you have access to the files
13:17 before you maybe the files
13:18 decades before you uh no we we did not
13:22 uh it was very much a
13:23 a current up we call current operational
13:26 picture
13:27 our focus was really twofold very simple
13:29 mission what is it and how does it work
13:31 uh we weren't interested in origins or
13:33 who's behind the wheel or intent at that
13:35 point but we're just trying to identify
13:36 what are these objects
13:38 and how do they work as for us we did
13:42 not have the historical documents
13:44 we were aware of them but we did not
13:46 necessarily have access nor did we use
13:48 them
13:49 because really our job was to provide a
13:52 current threat picture
13:53 for our leadership as to what the things
13:56 are
13:57 and the historical information although
13:59 very interesting
14:01 you did not have the fidelity or the
14:03 capabilities then like we have now we
14:05 did not have the high resolution cameras
14:08 the the the multi-spectrum radar
14:11 capabilities that we have now so a lot
14:14 of it was just eyewitness reports
14:16 and although eyewitness reports are
14:18 important um
14:19 obviously having collection technical
14:22 data collection is is is also
14:26 extremely compelling and very important
14:27 and that's what we were focusing on
14:29 okay so it was in the here and now you
14:32 you were
14:32 focusing on on those cases um correct
14:36 um so
14:40 when when you focus on on current cases
14:42 aren't you
14:43 weren't you uh curious uh uh
14:47 about what what your predecessors
14:50 correct
14:51 sorry when it's late my english just
14:52 drops a little bit
14:54 um so predecessors um
14:58 weren't you curious what what their data
15:00 was what they picked up on
15:02 well sure but at the time the only
15:04 predecessors we were really aware of
15:06 were those
15:06 part of project blue book and that had
15:09 closed decades and decades before
15:11 we had started our program so yeah and
15:14 sorry and but i thought you had one
15:18 uh a couple of pre programs just before
15:21 you uh
15:21 asap it was yes yeah but that was really
15:24 part of
15:25 and a tip and awesome began as the same
15:28 right
15:28 and then as asap faded away a tick took
15:31 over so
15:32 you know when when you say a tip i'm
15:34 assuming or presuming
15:35 you're also lumping asap into that that
15:37 we had access to
15:38 clearly uh but i thought you were
15:41 talking about you said decades
15:42 beforehand and so those were
15:44 yeah those were programs that were i i i
15:46 understood that between blue book
15:48 and uh uh a8 if there were
15:51 of course uh secret now we know that
15:54 correct now
15:55 now we know that there were some efforts
15:57 ongoing but at the time when i was at
15:58 ancient we
15:59 we were not i certainly was not privy to
16:02 that i think a lot of people
16:03 presumed that was the case but again we
16:06 were very much focused on the here and
16:07 now
16:08 and it wasn't until later that i had it
16:09 confirmed to me that there were
16:11 or some other efforts in the past uh
16:13 after blue book but before our program
16:15 and and were there agencies you know of
16:17 uh uh
16:18 operating uh parallel to aa tip you know
16:21 maybe you know other organizations you
16:23 were not communicating with
16:25 not that we were aware of and to this
16:27 day there doesn't seem to be anybody who
16:28 has come up and said yeah we were doing
16:30 the same thing so
16:31 i think at the time h it may have been
16:33 the only program
16:35 uh it wasn't the only program forever
16:37 but during the time it was
16:38 it was it was established i think it
16:41 was probably at the time probably the
16:43 only program going on
16:45 uh but i could be wrong um that's that's
16:47 just the best of my knowledge we
16:49 we asked the question many many times at
16:51 the highest levels
16:52 and uh we never we never received a
16:54 response
16:56 okay so from the moment you started when
17:00 was the first time you realized
17:02 this is a real thing well what case made
17:05 you
17:06 convinced that you were dealing with
17:08 something unknown
17:10 something that might be from earth but
17:12 could also be something that's not from
17:14 this
17:16 planet yeah it wasn't any particular
17:19 case
17:19 each one was compelling on its own um
17:22 obviously when you you
17:23 you you have a video and you have an
17:26 object
17:26 50 feet away from the cockpit um that's
17:29 very compelling
17:30 but it it's not just one case every time
17:35 we investigated a a a case that was
17:38 very compelling it was usually followed
17:40 by another one that was
17:41 just as equally and compelling or even
17:43 more compelling
17:45 because they're so different each one of
17:47 these there's some there's commonalities
17:49 that we identified
17:50 but there were also differences and
17:53 um each one of them were were unique to
17:57 some degree
17:57 and and again equally compelling
18:01 can i ask what case stood out for you
18:03 the most in your uh career
18:05 at a time well i can't talk about that
18:08 one
18:08 because it hasn't been made public yet
18:10 okay um
18:12 but um yeah uh there were
18:15 there were quite a few cases that were
18:18 to me very
18:19 very interesting and worthy of uh
18:22 further research and inquiry
18:24 okay um so
18:28 i i i you've been studying those cases
18:30 for for a couple of years
18:32 uh by the way if i'm taking too much of
18:34 your time just tell me um
18:36 no no you're fine max please i'm here
18:38 for you thank you
18:39 mr elizondo
18:46 please call me just just call me luke
18:48 whatever thank you lou
18:50 um okay so
18:54 um okay so you don't know if there were
18:56 any parallel uh
18:57 agencies uh uh researching this subject
19:00 in the united states but are you um
19:03 aware of any foreign government uh uh
19:08 having an agency working on the subject
19:11 yes yeah were it multiple governments
19:16 yes multiple governments some were
19:20 some were allied uh to the us some were
19:23 uh
19:24 somewhere adversarial to the united
19:26 states yeah i
19:28 i know for a fact the friend the fred
19:29 the french i think they have a very open
19:32 uh uh research uh organization i think
19:36 so do the russians at least they did
19:39 in the past yeah uh i have to be very
19:42 careful what i
19:43 what i what i say publicly about other
19:46 countries capabilities and incense
19:48 what i will say is that this is a topic
19:50 that's that's that's uh
19:52 of global concern um it's not just the
19:54 united states that's interested in this
19:56 topic there are other countries as well
19:58 and did you work together uh
20:02 boy or maybe exchange information you're
20:05 asking really good questions
20:07 um
20:10 sorry about it let me sidestep that no
20:12 no it's great listen
20:13 i mean you're asking fantastic questions
20:15 unfortunately some of these i have to be
20:17 very careful because
20:18 they're sensitive and it's it's like a
20:20 child
20:21 um and with two divorced parents
20:24 um you know in order to get permission
20:27 to
20:27 to watch tv the child needs permission
20:29 from both parents
20:31 not just one so for me to elaborate on
20:34 what type of information sharing
20:35 agreements existed
20:37 uh would probably not be prudent for me
20:39 especially
20:40 you know in light of the fact that maybe
20:43 maybe there are some countries that are
20:44 still kind of sensitive to this topic
20:47 so i wouldn't want to put them in an
20:49 uncomfortable position by either
20:50 confirming or denying their
20:52 participation so
20:53 i'll uh i'll i'll leave it with uh with
20:55 a polite pass
20:57 and um i'll great question
21:00 great question thank you and i i i don't
21:02 want you to compromise
21:04 anything uh yeah no no i appreciate it
21:07 i'm very careful not to do that and
21:08 again your questions are phenomenal
21:10 oh thank you sir thank you well i got
21:12 some more
21:14 all right um let me see
21:17 uh oh yeah so i i did a foia request uh
21:24 to to our uh defense forces the the
21:27 dutch military
21:29 so they uh responded
21:32 and they said they that our forces
21:37 have never witnessed or spotted
21:40 any ufos but when i asked
21:44 uh uh if there would might might be
21:47 another qualification for what they saw
21:49 they say yeah but we do see some
21:51 unknowns
21:53 so it's basically the same i guess it's
21:56 just they
21:57 they have another qualification for it
22:00 so
22:00 you know the the i think the term ufo
22:02 doesn't pop up in
22:04 any you know uh foia requests so they
22:06 they just call it unknown but
22:09 to take the topic seriously even if they
22:11 want to take the topic seriously
22:12 it's very difficult because uh their
22:15 peers when they hear the term ufo
22:18 tend to uh react in a negative manner
22:21 and so it's it's understandable they're
22:23 very risk-averse
22:24 yeah so the reason i'm asking you uh is
22:27 because my
22:28 uh uh my friends uh
22:31 brom rosa and alex griffin they run the
22:34 ufo hotline in holland it's basically a
22:37 website
22:38 whenever people spot something they can
22:42 you know put it on their website
22:45 with a picture or maybe a film or just a
22:48 disc
22:49 description but
22:53 they also have a map and you know you
22:55 can see exactly where
22:57 uh people are making a uh announcement
23:00 they saw something
23:02 and in holland there is a very clear
23:03 pattern we have a couple of military
23:06 air bases and some known but some
23:10 uh unknown let's say it's restricted
23:13 that that's where the there's uh nuclear
23:16 weapons
23:17 right so there's a very
23:20 you know those those spots in holland
23:23 are actually
23:24 like the red hot spots where where
23:25 there's the most activity
23:27 at least where people you know will will
23:30 notice them and there's one in
23:32 particular uh it
23:34 was susta in the cold war the americans
23:37 stored
23:37 um nuclear uh rockets there in in uh
23:40 in secret it was a very uh
23:44 top secret but there was the the biggest
23:47 case ever
23:48 in holland in 1979 a uap showed up
23:52 the size of a football field not making
23:54 noise and 13 dutch military were witness
23:57 to that
23:59 also civilians in the area
24:02 now uh this is a clear pattern
24:05 uh are you aware of any
24:09 uap activity in holland
24:12 or you know us officials know um
24:16 say
24:19 telling about ua activity in in holland
24:21 or the netherlands
24:22 uh again for the same reason that
24:26 i i want to respect the positions of uh
24:29 our
24:29 our our foreign allies i would never
24:32 want to speak on behalf of
24:34 of the dutch government but
24:37 i i suspect if you poke around a little
24:40 bit
24:43 there has been some some activity
24:45 certainly
24:46 um and you know you make a very
24:48 interesting point
24:50 about the connection between nuclear
24:53 technology and uap
24:54 activity that's a pattern that we
24:56 continue to see repeated over and over
24:58 again around the globe yeah i also
25:00 thought you would
25:01 tell us
25:04 sure yeah yeah i know robert yeah yeah
25:07 of course you know that's not the only
25:09 time that's happened and furthermore
25:11 the uh the folks on the other side of
25:14 our pond
25:15 uh in russia have had their own
25:17 encounters as well
25:18 uh and involving uh their nuclear
25:20 technology again i won't go into too
25:22 much detail but
25:23 um there there seems to be a global
25:25 pattern here
25:27 yeah and uh clearly from from a dutch
25:29 perspective or a u.s perspective or even
25:31 russian perspective
25:32 you know our nuclear technologies is
25:35 often considered
25:36 our crown jewels um it is a it is a
25:40 first line of deterrence uh into all-out
25:43 warfare
25:44 um whether we agree with it or not the
25:46 fact is that countries
25:48 maintain these these destructive devices
25:51 to to secure and ensure the peace
25:54 even though it may seem a little bit uh
25:56 contradictory at times
25:58 um that is uh that is the philosophy
26:00 that many countries have adopted
26:02 and if you have a technology that has
26:04 the ability to interfere with
26:06 that nuclear capability then clearly
26:10 that's going to be that's going to raise
26:12 some concern
26:13 for a lot of countries and rightfully so
26:17 definitely um it's extremely dangerous
26:20 because
26:21 it it doesn't even have to be uh
26:24 someone's fault maybe there's like a
26:25 uh you know something goes wrong
26:28 technical
26:29 technically and you're talking about a
26:32 nuclear weapon
26:33 and we're in big trouble um i mean let's
26:36 put this in real terms of let's say
26:38 right now the relationship between india
26:40 and pakistan
26:41 where they are on not such friendly
26:43 terms imagine if a
26:45 uap were to interfere with one side's
26:48 nuclear technology and unfortunately
26:51 it's perceived as a provocation of war
26:54 by the other side uh you can see how
26:56 dangerous that would be right
26:57 where right right you have one country
27:00 have this some sort of uap
27:02 activity and it's misconstrued to be
27:03 some sort of
27:05 enemy attack uh that's that's very
27:07 dangerous i mean that's that's that's a
27:09 a very extreme but but potential
27:11 scenario that we have to
27:13 pay attention to yeah um by the way
27:16 were you um acquainted with the dutch
27:19 sustainability case
27:21 i uh from 1979. i
27:24 i i am aware of it yes okay
27:27 and then on a let's say a top 10 27:31 uh worldwide case would it be in the top
27:34 10 27:36 um you know it depends on
27:39 on your qualifications for ranking are
27:42 we talking about
27:44 uh the number of eyewitnesses credible
27:46 eyewitnesses are we
27:47 talking about uh the performance
27:51 are we talking about capabilities and
27:54 intent
27:55 or are we talking about um
27:59 you know its significance towards
28:02 national security
28:03 depends how you qualify that when you
28:05 say top ten it's certainly significant
28:08 let's say the biggest one for pound case
28:10 i mean i would say also that you know
28:12 the the
28:13 the triangles uh that were seen uh as
28:17 well in the 90s
28:18 was a was a fairly significant event
28:20 over europe but there's been a lot that
28:22 have never been
28:23 been that have come out and seen the
28:25 light of day uh there's you know it'd be
28:27 very interesting i'm not going to say
28:29 much more than this but
28:30 you know it should be interesting to
28:32 know what nato has has
28:33 seen over the years wouldn't it yeah
28:35 definitely and by the way it was a
28:37 triangle
28:39 so but you knew that
28:42 [Laughter]
28:44 let me see um
28:47 okay uh at some point um
28:52 you know there was a decision to
28:54 disclose
28:55 um the fleur cam footage of uh you know
28:58 the
28:59 some pilots uh david fravor um
29:03 and and and some more i have the other
29:05 one of the other names here too
29:07 the commander underwood i think just
29:09 like
29:10 underwood yeah there's quite a few yeah
29:14 um so before
29:17 that time you know that this was always
29:19 in the paranormal
29:23 you know conspiracy theory little
29:28 thing um but not okay so in
29:31 2017 you you shared these images
29:35 with the new york times or the pentagon
29:37 did
29:38 what and why uh was
29:42 the decision made to you know make the
29:45 people aware
29:45 of this this is a real thing
29:49 well i i did not release the videos to
29:52 the new york times that was that was
29:54 somebody else
29:55 um i suspect you know
29:58 the the the purpose of it was to
30:01 to gain increased public awareness of
30:04 this topic and the seriousness of it
30:07 unfortunately the bureaucracy inside the
30:09 government at the time
30:10 was very restrictive and did not allow
30:13 this
30:14 certain information to get to the right
30:16 people in the right places
30:17 so they could make an informed decision
30:20 and from a command control perspective
30:23 from a governmental perspective that's a
30:25 failure that that's
30:26 uh the system is broken um and so
30:29 the only way uh to fix it sometimes is
30:32 to
30:33 to shed some light on the problem and do
30:35 it in a way where you don't compromise
30:37 sources and methods you don't violate
30:38 your
30:39 your secrecy out but you still have a
30:41 conversation
30:43 and you know maybe maybe increase the
30:46 aperture
30:46 for for greater transparency ultimately
30:49 this is a topic in my opinion that
30:52 that doesn't belong under the providence
30:54 of any particular government or
30:56 organization or institution or religion
30:59 belongs to all of us equally it involves
31:01 humanity and it's a global issue
31:03 and uh if that's the case then why not
31:06 why not have a global discussion like
31:08 we're doing right now um
31:10 yeah and thank you for that uh you know
31:13 um
31:14 so this was basically a political move
31:18 to share those images you know or maybe
31:22 to
31:22 to press to put some pressure on on
31:26 certain
31:29 areas of the government maybe
31:32 um so
31:36 if you so this is a really
31:40 i think moving thing because this is
31:44 going to change
31:45 everything about man mankind what we
31:47 ever
31:48 all we knew is going to
31:51 be totally different
31:55 i i was wondering is there
31:59 maybe also a uh
32:02 let's say a reason to share this because
32:05 there might be
32:07 way more encounters coming
32:11 and we need to be prepared
32:14 well uh you know that's that's a
32:15 question that's often asked
32:17 why why now and uh
32:21 why this way and my response is
32:25 why not now you know this is a
32:28 discussion
32:29 that i've said before is is is not like
32:32 fine wine
32:33 where the longer you keep a cork on it
32:35 the better it gets
32:36 um i think this is a conversation that's
32:38 a little bit like uh
32:40 old fruit or vegetables in the
32:42 refrigerator um
32:44 and the longer it stays in the
32:45 refrigerator the more it stinks it
32:47 begins to rot
32:48 yeah and so uh you know it's been quite
32:51 a few decades that this fruit has been
32:53 sitting in the refrigerator rotting
32:55 it's it's not going to smell any better
32:57 we probably
32:58 need to to clean the fridge out
33:00 refrigerator in my opinion
33:03 and so maybe this is a way to have the
33:06 conversation begin
33:09 and uh allow people to digest
33:12 the the fact that um these things are
33:15 real
33:15 that that ufos uaps are real without
33:19 going to any preconceived conclusion of
33:21 what it is or where it's from or what
33:23 their intentions are
33:25 we have we have still some way to go to
33:27 answer those questions
33:28 first we we need to recognize the
33:30 reality that these are real
33:32 and once we we we recognize that as a
33:35 people as a society
33:37 then collectively we can have the
33:39 conversation to determine what we want
33:40 to do about it
33:41 if anything okay and
33:44 uh okay so we we're not saying
33:47 it's extraterrestrial but we're not
33:49 saying it's not
33:52 it is it is highly there's only three
33:54 scenarios it's either
33:55 our technology here in the us and uh
33:59 if so then we've got some significant
34:01 problems because we have failed
34:03 time and time and time again to
34:05 coordinate the testing of this exotic
34:07 technology
34:08 in and around our rather our other
34:09 capabilities uh
34:11 you have an entire entire organization
34:14 called the joint chiefs
34:16 where their job is to deconflict and
34:17 make sure that we don't step on each
34:19 other's toes
34:20 and certainly if this is some sort of
34:22 secret u.s technology and we're flying
34:23 it over major populated areas
34:26 then it's not really so secret is it
34:29 what we do is if we have secret
34:30 technology we test it at places like
34:32 area 51 34:33 where people aren't going to see it we
34:35 don't test it over major metropolitan
34:37 areas
34:38 so that's one scenario yeah or why why
34:41 take out your own nuclear bombs
34:43 yeah right exactly take out your own
34:45 nuclear bombs exactly so so the chances
34:47 are
34:47 very very very slim very minimal that
34:50 it's our technology
34:51 the other option is that it's foreign
34:53 adversarial technology and if that's the
34:55 case we
34:56 we have a bigger problem than we had
34:57 before because
34:59 now our national security apparatus
35:01 despite our very best intelligence and
35:03 humans and signature
35:04 elent and imminent and all the different
35:07 disciplines of intelligence
35:08 have failed have failed to something to
35:10 the scale of 9 11 35:12 of september 11th where the
35:14 organizations have been caught
35:16 completely off guard by some sort of
35:18 revolutionary technology that some
35:20 adversary has developed
35:22 and by the way they've had it for
35:23 decades and by the way
35:25 we have failed to report this to
35:26 congress and by the way we have failed
35:28 to report this to the head
35:30 of our intelligence community and oh by
35:32 the way we have failed to report just to
35:34 the head of our department of defense
35:35 right national security so there would
35:37 be a whole bunch of series of failures
35:40 there
35:40 that um you know would certainly uh put
35:43 us at any disadvantage if we were to go
35:45 into any type of real major conflict
35:48 the third option is that it's not our
35:50 technology and it's not adversarial
35:52 technology
35:53 technology it's it's something else
35:54 completely different something
35:56 completely and totally separate from
35:58 from
36:00 our own technology as as a people um
36:03 and it's looking more and more probable
36:06 that that
36:07 may be the scenario that maybe the
36:08 situation we're dealing with we're
36:10 dealing with a technology that is
36:12 is not necessarily human perhaps
36:16 sure how would you
36:20 describe the pattern of behavior of
36:23 these
36:24 vehicles is it like uh
36:28 observant of of whatever we do you know
36:31 the military or or
36:32 uh people is it um
36:36 maybe aggressive violent or is it
36:40 maybe protective trying to contain us
36:43 for
36:44 from harming ourselves maybe i think
36:47 i think that's a question that um
36:50 if you ask anybody out there you'll get
36:53 different different opinions
36:54 um at the end of the day we simply don't
36:57 know
36:58 uh whether it's good or bad uh
37:01 or or something in between the bottom
37:03 line is that
37:05 if this was a a if these aircraft had a
37:08 russian star on the tail or a north
37:10 korean tail number
37:11 and they were flying over major u.s
37:13 populated cities
37:15 it would be a significant geopolitical
37:17 issue
37:18 we would have hearings on the hill we
37:21 would
37:22 have calls to action we would uh it
37:24 would be very provocative
37:26 uh in some cases it could be considered
37:28 an act of war right
37:29 so um you know from a national security
37:32 perspective
37:33 i think we need to to to look at this
37:36 for what it is it's a capability well
37:39 beyond anything that we currently have
37:41 in our inventory
37:42 whose intent we haven't figured out yet
37:45 so
37:45 for us we our presumption is that it
37:48 could be a threat if it wanted to be
37:50 so we probably need to figure it out um
37:53 you know as far as overt hostilities
37:55 well again it depends who you ask
37:57 if if i come over to a particular
38:00 country and i take their nuclear weapons
38:02 offline
38:03 that's a pretty provocative act you know
38:05 that's that's not a friendly act
38:07 uh but then again you know if you are uh
38:10 if you are
38:11 somebody who is against you know
38:15 nuclear proliferation then one could
38:16 argue well they're actually doing it
38:18 for our own good yeah but because when
38:21 when my
38:22 son plays with matches i'll i'll take it
38:24 from him
38:26 sure right yeah and that's you know
38:28 that's that's a that's
38:29 that's that's good reasoning uh but
38:32 typically when you take
38:33 matches away from your son you explain
38:34 to him why you're taking the matches
38:37 away
38:37 and and the dangers with it right you
38:39 just don't take the matches out of his
38:41 hand and not talk to him
38:42 you explain to your son look these are
38:44 dangerous look if you play with these
38:46 you can burn the house down you can hurt
38:48 yourself you can hurt other people
38:51 we don't seem to see that it's just you
38:54 know
38:55 taking matches out of people's hands and
38:57 by the way letting
38:58 other people still have matches so i i
39:00 again i i understand i'm not trying to
39:03 sow fear into the hearts of anyone i'm
39:06 trying to be pragmatic
39:07 um you know another instance is that
39:09 there's a lot of people out there who
39:10 claim
39:11 that they have had interaction with
39:13 these things in fact there are some
39:15 people there's a subculture of people
39:17 uh that call themselves abductees or or
39:20 experiencers who claim to have
39:22 had up close and personal contact with
39:25 these things
39:26 and if that's the case and they've been
39:27 taken away from their own
39:29 against their own free will in my
39:31 country we call that kidnapping that's a
39:33 crime
39:34 right and furthermore if if if i were to
39:36 touch you against your free will
39:38 well now that's assault you know that's
39:40 that's another crime
39:41 so uh i i
39:45 i find it very difficult to assume one
39:48 way or another that it is or it is not a
39:50 threat
39:51 so i prefer to presume that it could be
39:53 if it wanted to be so let's try to
39:55 figure this out
39:56 was aatip also involved in investigating
39:59 uh abduction cases
40:02 uh no not directly
40:05 it was uh there was a portion of atip
40:08 that focused on what we call biological
40:10 effects and that includes anything from
40:12 a blade of grass on the ground
40:14 to uh to an animal to to a human being
40:20 has there ever been been um
40:25 how do you say this in english has there
40:27 ever been
40:30 uh uh dna has that been
40:33 investigated to see if something is not
40:36 human not
40:37 uh maybe from a from an animal
40:40 has there ever been dna found that is
40:42 unknown to us
40:45 well i think the premise of dna is is
40:48 already we need to be careful when we
40:50 say dna because dna
40:52 is is a terrestrial thing living things
40:53 living organisms
40:55 on this planet have dna um
40:59 but that doesn't necessarily mean that
41:01 all life forms in the universe would
41:02 have
41:03 dna to test right so or
41:07 look at a virus a virus doesn't have dna
41:09 but it has rna
41:11 that virus replicates like a living
41:13 thing
41:14 and it reproduces and it has a lot of
41:16 the similarities and functions of
41:18 survivability that a living thing has
41:20 but it has no dna it has rna
41:23 and in fact there's other living things
41:25 that don't have dna or rna so
41:27 you know we have to be careful when we
41:29 assume that
41:30 everything is going to be playing by our
41:32 rules biologically speaking i'm not sure
41:34 that's necessarily the case
41:36 yeah of course you know it doesn't mean
41:38 like uh
41:39 in theory other life forms have have to
41:42 have the same
41:45 circumstances as we as humans have you
41:47 know maybe
41:48 they are accustomed to another
41:52 totally different climate or you know
41:54 maybe
41:55 can live without some things we cannot
41:57 live
41:58 without um but is there some uh maybe
42:01 equivalent to what dna is to us you
42:05 maybe have been investigating at the
42:07 time
42:08 um i'm going to go ahead and
42:12 pass on that question only because uh
42:15 i don't think the answer would be um
42:19 be satisfying um we looked at a lot of
42:22 things
42:23 in the early days particularly under the
42:24 asap umbrella of atip
42:27 we looked at a lot of things and a lot
42:29 of things were very interesting very
42:31 compelling
42:32 but at the end of the day i can only
42:34 speak on behalf of atip in my time in a
42:36 tip and my function in etip
42:38 and during my time at data our focus was
42:42 primarily on the
42:43 the nuts and bolts of of the uap
42:45 phenomenon
42:47 okay sir um let me
42:50 see if i if you need to stop this
42:53 and you just tell me no i'll respect go
42:56 ahead i know
42:57 go ahead please okay so we we touched
43:00 down on this a little bit just yet
43:03 but why does the us government
43:07 make
43:10 in comparison to to the past such an uh
43:14 effort to make the the the
43:17 people aware of this is something that
43:20 that
43:20 is happening or going on right now and
43:23 it might be real
43:24 yeah so uh you were uaps are definitely
43:27 real
43:28 what they are might be extraterrestrial
43:30 too you know we have to take that into
43:32 account you know they want us to know
43:34 this could be a real possibility why now
43:37 and
43:37 why not before well i i think that this
43:42 is a conversation no one really wanted
43:43 to have for a very long time
43:45 uh and again going back to my analogy of
43:47 rotten fruit in the refrigerator
43:49 um i think it's it's it it's becoming so
43:53 apparent
43:54 that the reality of uaps is
43:57 is real that the government now is in a
44:01 interesting situation that the longer it
44:03 keeps its secret
44:05 the more people will begin to distrust
44:06 the government
44:08 it is very important for people to trust
44:10 their own government
44:11 when people lose faith and confidence in
44:13 their government and their institutions
44:15 um the end is usually near and for that
44:18 for that organization
44:20 and so i think there are people in the
44:22 government that realize that
44:23 um as as technology continues to
44:26 proliferate and everybody now has a
44:28 smart device in their hand
44:30 uh it's becoming um the evidence is
44:32 becoming overwhelming
44:34 and and we probably need to have this
44:36 conversation
44:38 like yesterday um because what we don't
44:40 want to do is be on the wrong side of
44:42 history we don't want to get to a point
44:43 where we say these things aren't real
44:45 and all of a sudden you know you have a
44:47 mass sighting where
44:48 300 000 people over let's say los
44:51 angeles
44:52 see something that you know is clearly
44:54 not an f-18 or a helicopter or
44:57 or drone or something like that yeah
45:01 okay so let's talk a little bit about we
45:03 just talked about the behavior
45:05 of the the object
45:11 but i've been talking to
45:15 james fox and jeremy corbell and they
45:17 gave me some information on
45:19 these things don't seem to have any
45:21 propulsion systems
45:22 um it doesn't have any action reaction
45:25 device
45:26 devices but it and it
45:29 dawns all rules of gravity uh
45:33 we are we know of and uh like david
45:36 traver described
45:38 it seems to be uh you know
45:43 like disappearing in a split second and
45:46 popping up
45:46 in that same second kilometers or miles
45:50 away
45:51 um is that speed
45:55 or is that the bending of space and time
45:58 ah yes well
46:02 let's talk very briefly about the five
46:04 observables five observables are the
46:06 five fundamental characteristics that an
46:08 a-tip we were able to
46:09 solidify as being truly unique to uaps
46:12 versus anything else
46:14 the first is something we call
46:16 instantaneous acceleration
46:18 yeah the the ability to go from point a
46:21 to point b
46:22 in a very very quick moment where the
46:25 the forces of acceleration are are
46:29 are beyond what we we currently can
46:32 can replicate so what do i mean by that
46:34 well
46:35 when i go from here to here very quickly
46:37 there are
46:39 forces that are exerted and experienced
46:41 and we call those g-forces forces of
46:43 gravity
46:44 and to put that into context the human
46:46 being can withstand probably about
46:48 nine nine g's g-forces
46:52 for a very short period of time before
46:54 we start having
46:55 uh negative uh biological consequences
46:58 like red outs blackouts and
47:00 and ultimately death because it's the
47:03 forces that are experienced by the body
47:05 the body is just not able to handle it
47:07 to contrast that to one of our most
47:10 maneuverable aircraft that we have it's
47:13 an older aircraft but it's still one of
47:14 our most highly maneuverable
47:16 it is the general dynamics f-16 aircraft
47:20 and we use them in nato as well
47:22 and this is an aircraft that can pull
47:25 probably between 17 and 18 47:27 g's before the wings begin to to fail
47:30 you have
47:31 you have structural failure you have uh
47:34 the limitations of our material science
47:37 to to withstand these forces begin to
47:39 begin to break down
47:41 and uh and what we're seeing with these
47:43 ufos in contrast to that
47:45 these things are being able to pull four
47:47 five six seven hundred eight hundred g's
47:50 instantly um so so when you see a
47:53 technology able to do that
47:55 um it's certainly something well beyond
47:57 anything we have
47:58 the second observable is hypersonic
48:00 velocity so let's take our airplane here
48:02 again
48:03 hypersonic velocities are those speeds
48:05 that are defined by
48:07 mach 5 or above by definition so the
48:10 speed of sound times five
48:12 plus when you are traveling at that
48:14 speed
48:15 there are all sorts of consequences
48:18 and signatures associated with that
48:20 first of all you have friction
48:22 and heat ablation off the nose and off
48:24 of the leading edges
48:25 you also have atmospheric ionization
48:28 which is the stripping of the electrons
48:30 from the atmosphere
48:31 you also have contrails visual
48:33 signatures
48:34 uh like you know if you will the exhaust
48:37 and then of course you have acoustic
48:38 signatures like
48:39 sonic booms and sound these things are
48:42 able in some cases to travel not just
48:44 mach 5 but
48:45 up to 13 000 miles an hour and do that
48:49 in low atmosphere conditions where the
48:51 air friction coefficients are
48:53 are very very restrictive we have a very
48:56 tough time
48:58 there's very few things we have in
49:00 inventory that can go
49:01 mach 5 let alone that speed
49:05 the third observable is a little bit of
49:07 a
49:08 contradiction but it's low observability
49:11 it's hard to
49:12 see it with gun camera footage it looks
49:15 fuzzy it's hard to see it with radar we
49:17 get this weird nonsensical returns
49:19 and even to the naked eye you'll hear
49:22 that people say you know i saw this
49:23 object
49:24 it was metallic but i can't describe it
49:27 because it doesn't look like anything
49:28 that we
49:28 we have at all the fourth uh observable
49:32 is what we call trans medium travel the
49:34 ability to operate in multiple different
49:37 environments without sacrificing
49:39 performance characteristics so to put
49:41 this into perspective
49:43 an aircraft looks like an aircraft
49:44 because it's designed to fly in our
49:46 atmosphere so it has a nose it has a
49:48 tail it has a rudder
49:49 it has wings elevators ailerons to
49:52 control itself and then you have a jet
49:54 engine
49:56 whereas a rocket which spends most of
49:57 its time in a vacuum environment
50:00 low earth orbit or or higher uh doesn't
50:03 use wings
50:04 because there's no there's no reason to
50:06 there's no atmosphere there's no you
50:07 can't use a jet engine so
50:09 a rocket has thrusters and a rocket uses
50:12 chemical
50:13 engines to to to uh
50:16 to maneuver in those environments and
50:19 then a submarine
50:20 looks like a submarine because it's
50:22 designed to be underwater and it neither
50:24 looks like a plane or a rocket in fact
50:25 it uses a propeller
50:27 to mechanically displace water and it
50:29 uses buoyancy to go up and down
50:31 and imagine now if you had a
50:34 submarine that could fly and also go
50:37 into space
50:39 that's unusual we as mankind we
50:42 do have some technologies that can
50:44 operate in multiple domains
50:46 environments but there's always a
50:48 performance sacrifice so what do i mean
50:50 by that let's take a seaplane
50:52 a plane that can both fly and land on
50:55 water
50:55 but when you look at a steep plane it is
50:57 neither a very good airplane
50:59 nor is it a very good boat uh because
51:02 it's a design compromise and so the more
51:04 environments you want to operate in the
51:06 more of a compromise it becomes
51:08 um and yet these things that we're
51:10 seeing
51:11 uh don't seem to have that that
51:13 compromise so it's it's a game changer
51:15 and then the last observable
51:17 is uh as you say uh positive lift or
51:20 anti-gravity now
51:22 there's only three fundamental ways we
51:24 know how to defy
51:25 the natural effects of the earth's
51:26 gravity one is through
51:29 uh balancing the forces of thrust
51:32 lift drag and weight and when you do
51:34 that you can fly
51:35 you create lift and you fly yeah another
51:37 way
51:38 is through shear ballistics i can put
51:40 enough energy force equals mass times
51:42 acceleration and i can blast something
51:44 out of a tube
51:45 like a mortar like a rocket like a
51:47 firework and blow it out of a tube
51:50 and then eventually what goes up comes
51:52 back down
51:53 and the last way we know how to defy
51:55 earth's gravity for the most part
51:56 is is through buoyancy or lighter than
51:59 air so think of helium think of hydrogen
52:01 think of hot air balloons where the
52:03 density inside
52:05 that that compartment is less than
52:08 outside therefore it rises up kind of
52:10 like oil on water
52:11 but that's it um and yet these things
52:14 are able to defy
52:15 our gravity without wings without
52:17 control surfaces without
52:19 uh any type of obvious signs of
52:21 propulsion so the question is how are
52:23 they
52:24 yeah i i have a little theory uh
52:28 maybe they're not defying gravity maybe
52:30 they're using gravity
52:31 because gravity is pulling us to to
52:34 earth it's a magnet right
52:35 but if you like put two magnets
52:39 towards each other you know you can
52:41 actually it almost hovers
52:43 basically you know yeah well what if
52:46 what if
52:46 what if it was even a little simpler
52:48 than that what if
52:50 if the ability to can't so what is
52:52 gravity gravity
52:53 is really a warping as we now know
52:56 through einstein excuse me one second i
52:58 think my wife just came over i have to
53:00 open the door
53:02 so sure no worries
53:06 and in the meantime folks i'll tell you
53:07 a little joke how about that
53:09 what is the difference between in-laws
53:13 and outlaws outlaws are usually wanted
53:19 let's see if i have another joke for you
53:20 sorry about that
53:22 no worries max i told your audience a
53:24 little joke
53:25 oh okay i'll see that later
53:29 okay um so so
53:32 yeah look you know we're talking about
53:34 gravity so you know there were three fun
53:36 there's up up until recently there was
53:40 only one fundamental model for
53:42 for for science and that was newtonian
53:44 science where we all understand about
53:46 gravity falling from the tree and
53:47 force equals mass times acceleration and
53:49 whatnot then
53:50 last century along comes this guy named
53:52 einstein with the crazy hair
53:54 and he proposes the theory of relativity
53:56 where we now realize
53:57 space and time are actually connected
53:59 they're not two different things they're
54:00 actually connected
54:02 intimately and they're flexible you can
54:05 actually stretch
54:06 space-time uh and then now
54:09 over the last 30 years four years we
54:10 have the introduction of quantum physics
54:13 which is yet another bizarre layer upon
54:16 our reality but yet it is it is very
54:18 true
54:19 and it explains the universe at the very
54:22 small levels
54:23 and once uh there was a gentleman who
54:25 described uh
54:28 quantum physics this way a dog walks
54:31 into a box
54:32 and out walks to cats
54:35 doesn't make sense and yet that's what
54:37 we're seeing uh you know from a from an
54:39 observation perspective
54:41 i think
54:45 so so in essence we have we have we have
54:48 three types of science that are all true
54:50 and correct
54:51 and when you look at gravity and what
54:53 gravity is we assume
54:54 this is gravity when i let the pen go it
54:56 falls but that's not really gravity that
54:58 is a
54:59 result of gravity gravity
55:02 is really the warping of space time and
55:05 that
55:06 warping of space-time creates this
55:10 we can call it an attractive force but
55:13 it it may not even be that at all it may
55:15 be something even much more bizarre but
55:17 but for argument's sake
55:19 if you had the ability to negate or
55:22 neutralize
55:23 the effects of earth's gravity in
55:25 essence pretend like
55:27 earth isn't even here then
55:30 the way you experience space-time with
55:33 fundamentally be
55:34 different than the way outside so if you
55:36 were able to successfully
55:38 create a bubble around you right now in
55:41 your studio
55:42 and insulate yourself from the effects
55:44 of earth's gravity
55:45 a couple things would happen first of
55:47 all you wouldn't need wings or engines
55:49 to float because gravity no longer
55:51 affects you there
55:53 secondly you would have the ability to
55:56 move around in space time but
55:59 from the outside observer i would see
56:02 you
56:03 performing things that seem to be
56:05 unbelievably
56:06 crazy but in reality
56:10 for from your perspective you're just
56:14 behaving normally and i and everybody
56:16 else outside your bubble
56:18 is is walking in slow motion so
56:21 it's it's both are real but they're
56:24 relative to each other and so a lot of
56:26 the
56:26 the observations we're seeing the
56:28 observables
56:29 may very well be a result of someone or
56:33 something has now the technology to
56:37 manipulate the space-time construct in a
56:40 local life area
56:41 and that is why we are able to see the
56:44 five observables the way we do
56:46 okay well that was a very very
56:49 uh educated uh
56:53 explanation um so
56:56 thank you for that so i'm gonna ask you
56:59 just one
57:00 last question um and that is of course
57:02 we have the the the 180-day ultimatum
57:06 um what are what are your expectations
57:09 on that
57:10 are we is there really something going
57:12 to be disclosed to the general public or
57:14 is it uh going to be very disappointing
57:18 uh neither uh i i'm very careful to
57:21 manage expectations
57:23 um you know first of all i don't think
57:25 180 days is long enough
57:27 uh to to provide a comprehensive report
57:30 to congress uh it takes longer in some
57:32 cases to remodel someone's kitchen
57:34 than it does to to provided this report
57:37 so
57:38 uh i think um if if i was in charge for
57:41 the day
57:42 i would provide an interim report to
57:44 congress as they expected
57:46 and as they deserve and then i would
57:48 request a an extension
57:51 and uh and with a promise to to provide
57:54 a much more comprehensive report
57:56 do a very deep data call within the us
57:58 government and our friends and our
58:00 allies
58:01 and and and provide a comprehensive
58:03 report back to congress
58:05 uh and and probably probably with a
58:07 classified annex
58:09 that will provide a lot of details to
58:11 congress
58:12 and then allow the american people to
58:14 the greatest extent possible
58:16 have access to the the information
58:20 that we already have um as long as it
58:22 doesn't compromise national security or
58:25 or or sources of methods of course
58:28 so uh we know there's a new uap task
58:31 force at the moment right
58:32 um have they ever approached you uh for
58:35 some intel
58:36 or maybe i i can't go into that i'm
58:39 sorry
58:40 i can't great again great question
58:42 you're asking fantastic questions but i
58:44 uh i'm not at liberty to discuss what if
58:47 any relationship
58:48 i might or might not have with within
58:50 elements of the years and i completely
58:52 respect that
58:52 uh and by the way you know if you you
58:55 know
58:55 want to disclose anything i'm the guy
59:03 very good all right
59:06 let me see um mr elizondo um
59:10 i think i'm out of questions uh maybe
59:13 you would
59:14 actually yeah let me if i may say to you
59:16 and your audience
59:17 first of all sincerely and most
59:19 heartfelt thank you very much
59:21 for taking the time to do this also let
59:23 me let me
59:25 congratulate you for being on the right
59:26 side of history uh thank you
59:28 i know this is a unpopular topic um
59:32 believe me i i i get it um
59:35 i got a lot of abuse you're you're
59:38 you're doing the right thing
59:40 um you know there was a time when the
59:42 church refused to look through
59:45 galileo's telescope in order for him to
59:48 prove that the earth was not the center
59:50 of the solar system
59:51 and of course copernicus and whatnot but
59:54 um
59:55 change is tough change is tough and it
59:57 takes
59:58 the courage of people like you to to
60:01 have
60:02 a an open and honest conversation
60:05 uh with your your fellow citizens and i
60:08 wanna i wanna
60:09 tell you sincerely that um i i know it's
60:12 not easy
60:13 and uh but i will tell you you're
60:15 absolutely doing the right thing
60:17 and and that truth is coming out and at
60:19 some point people are going to recognize
60:21 that
60:21 and and hopefully they'll come back to
60:23 you and thank you for
60:24 for your contributions so on behalf of
60:26 all of us
60:28 on the outside thank you for what you're
60:30 doing thank you sir because
60:32 you know you are
60:35 you know maybe the first person to
60:38 actually have the courage to really
60:41 speak out and you know i know you must
60:42 have compromised a lot by doing that
60:45 um but thank you for that you know
60:47 that's a big sacrifice
60:48 and um you know uh i think i see it as
60:51 my duty now
60:53 uh you know to to spread
60:56 and educate uh people uh on this topic
61:00 even though i get some abuse but i don't
61:02 mind you know that's uh
61:04 you know collateral damage as you say
61:07 sure
61:09 and um you know um so basically let me
61:12 um finish this up
61:16 by uh asking your permission to use this
61:18 footage
61:19 to upload as a podcast absolutely
61:22 max whatever whatever you want to do no
61:24 problem okay thank you i might do it
61:26 like in
61:27 like in in a hole without any uh uh
61:29 edits so you know people
61:31 whenever you want uh you know my joke
61:33 was terrible when you left it wasn't bad
61:35 it was just
61:36 it was it was uh it wasn't a uh a
61:38 distasteful joke it was just a silly dad
61:40 joke so
61:41 i'm just gonna preface that right now i
61:43 i i figured uh
61:45 you know oh what the hell
61:48 i'm i'm known for my dad jokes uh over
61:50 here my son is five years old he hates
61:52 my jokes by the way
61:53 yeah i've got to say i've got a bunch of
61:55 dad jokes and it's you know it's it's
61:57 so yeah um okay so um
62:01 i'm gonna do my best and by the way uh
62:03 i'm very fortunate
62:04 to uh have been given such a big
62:07 platform in holland
62:08 because i have to you know thank the
62:10 magazine you review they are
62:12 willing to do this and by the way
62:14 they're known for absolutely
62:16 to be a little bit rebellious
62:19 you know my hat's off and thank thank
62:21 you to to to uh
62:23 to uh your your media company for
62:26 allowing this
62:26 story to come out um i think history
62:29 will will judge them uh
62:31 uh quite positively for doing this yeah
62:33 and and
62:34 let me uh so the the chief the
62:36 editor-in-chief is danny cox
62:38 from new review so i'm just going to
62:39 throw out his name and my two friends
62:42 and alex griffin who are two pioneers on
62:44 the subject you know they run the
62:46 websites
62:47 uh the ufo hotline but also
62:50 uh an educational website of like among
62:53 the stories of susta bear
62:54 mr elizondo thank you i've taken way too
62:58 much of your time
62:59 and no no my pleasure thank you it's
63:02 been my honor and my privilege thank you
63:04 so much max
63:05 anytime you want to want to have a
63:06 discussion please let me know
63:08 okay sir thank you so much and uh well i
63:11 hope to
63:12 talk to you uh some time again
63:15 you got it thank you and have a good one
63:18 take care
63:18 you too take care thank you so much
